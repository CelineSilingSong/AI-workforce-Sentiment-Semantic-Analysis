More than half of workers say they are worried that AI makes them look replaceable, research from Microsoft and LinkedIn has found.Three quarters of knowledge workers now use AI at work, saying it saves time, boosts creativity, and allows them to focus on their most important work. However, more than half of these admit that they're using it for their most important tasks, with 53% now worried about being replaced with AI entirely.In a report, 'AI at work is here. Now comes the hard part', the companies found that the use of generative AI at work has nearly doubled in the past six months. LinkedIn says it's seeing a significant increase in professionals adding AI skills to their profiles, something most leaders say they now look for in a new hire.The report identifies a group of power users who have reorganised their work processes and are saving more than 30 minutes per day. More than nine in ten of these power users say AI makes their overwhelming workload more manageable and their work more enjoyable.LATEST VIDEOS FROM itproITProThese users are 61% more likely to have heard from their CEO about the importance of using generative AI at work, 53% more likely to receive encouragement from leadership to consider how AI can transform their function, and 35% more likely to receive tailored AI training for their particular role.""AI is democratizing expertise across the workforce,"" says Satya Nadella, chairman and CEO of Microsoft. ""Our latest research highlights the opportunity for every organization to apply this technology to drive better decision-making, collaboration — and ultimately business outcomes.""However, although 79% of leaders agree that adopting AI is critical to remain competitive, 59% worry about quantifying the productivity gains of AI and 60% say their company lacks a vision and plan to implement it.Get the ITPro. daily newsletterReceive our latest news, industry updates, featured resources and more.

Efficiency through artificial intelligence



Rail freight booking service RailX is one of a number of transport partners that will work alongside startup companies to develop artificial intelligence and machine learning solutions to industry challenges.
As part of Digital Catapult’s High Growth AI Accelerator for transport programme, the company will work to drive the adoption of AI and machine learning as it works to solve ongoing operational challenges, whilst also progressing decarbonisation and efficiency goals.

“There is huge potential for AI to have a transformative effect on both efficiency and productivity for these projects spanning from London to north-east England and across different transport modes” – Sara El-Hanfy

Through the new accelerator, RailX will work alongside Atera Analytics Ltd, Singular Intelligence Limited and iPurvey to develop ways that rail and road freight bookings can be automated and optimised. This will contribute to the decarbonisation of the booking process, whilst also improving efficiency and productivity, which is a key part of RailX’s long-term commercial success.
This work will also help to demonstrate the value of AI and machine learning in the process of making further sustainability gains across the rail freight sector, and the wider transport sector as a whole.
Speaking about the influence that this project can have on transport, Innovate UK’s Head of Artificial Intelligence, Sara El-Hanfy, said:




“It is inspiring to see the projects moving forward as part of the High Growth Accelerator. As part of the Innovate UK BridgeAI programme, this initiative shows how the cohort of companies joining could influence and accelerate the adoption of AI. There is huge potential for AI to have a transformative effect on both efficiency and productivity for these projects spanning from London to north-east England and across different transport modes, promising wide-reaching benefits for the sector.”
With the announcement of this news comes the beginning of a 14-week programme that will see each of the startup companies involved across the wider programme provided with a range of resources by Digital Catapult. These include computational power, strategic guidance, holistic diagnostics, and tailored support, as well as access to an ecosystem of developers and peer learning to ensure that expertise and capabilities can be developed.
Jessica Rushworth, Chief Strategy and Policy Officer at Digital Catapult, also commented:
“The BridgeAI transport accelerator holds the potential to address critical challenges within the sector and open up several new avenues for economic growth and investment. Achieving efficiency, productivity and sustainability gains in the transport industry will be a key determinant to fostering sustainable sectoral growth.”

                LinkedIn Shares Insight Into Professional Use of Generative AI
            





        Published May 8, 2024

Andrew Hutchinson
Content and Social Media Manager





























































Looking to get a better handle on the evolving impact that generative AI is having on your industry, and potentially your career?
This will help. LinkedIn has partnered with parent company Microsoft to provide a new overview of the AI landscape, and how these advanced tools are changing the workforce as we know it.
And while you’re likely aware of the rising AI impact, having additional context on the actual scope of professional transformation could provide you with more impetus to learn these systems, and how to use them to your benefit.
First off, the report notes that the use of generative AI has nearly doubled in the last six months, with 75% of global knowledge workers now using AI tools in their regular process.

That’s not overly surprising, but the real test is how helpful these tools can be, and what people are actually using them for. A worker using ChatGPT once every now and then to come up with an idea isn’t a major shift, but referring to an AI bot every day is significant, and that context is somewhat missed by this question. 
But even so, 75% is a very high number, which underlines the importance of AI tools and their potential in the modern workforce.
Yet, at the same time, 53% of people who use AI at work also worry that using it on important work tasks could make them look replaceable.




















It’s a difficult balance, but the idea of AI tools is not to replace humans (in most cases), but to supplement, and provide assistance to refine specific tasks. AI outputs alone are generally not enough to fill-in for actual human expertise, but they can streamline many processes, which should lead to significant workplace efficiency.
And as you would expect, younger users are more actively adopting the new wave of AI apps.

That further points to future shifts, because as these youngsters grow up in a world where generative AI exists, they’ll increasingly find new uses for it, which will then lead to broader reliance on AI in the workforce.
And clearly, hiring managers are already factoring this in:

If you’re not at least aware of how the latest AI tools could assist in your work, then you need to increase your knowledge, and ensure that you’re across the disruption that these apps are causing in your sector.
The report also looks at which job roles are adding AI skills, based on LinkedIn data.

Of course, not everyone is updating their LinkedIn profile to reflect such, but the graph gives you some idea of which areas AI is having an impact, at least in terms of prompting members to improve their knowledge. 
There are also some further LinkedIn data points included in the report:

In the past six months, the use of LinkedIn Learning courses designed to build AI aptitude has spiked 160% among non-technical professionals, with roles like project managers, architects, and administrative assistants looking to skill up most.
We’ve also seen a 142x increase in LinkedIn members globally adding AI skills like ChatGPT and Copilot to their profiles - with writers, designers, and marketers topping the list. 
LinkedIn job posts that mention artificial intelligence or generative AI have seen 17% greater application growth over the past two years compared to job posts that don’t mention them. 

The report provides an interesting snapshot of the current AI landscape, and the disruption that AI is causing in various industries.
But the bottom line, and likely the main intention of the report, is that you need to be upping your knowledge of generative AI tools, and how they’re impacting your industry.
At the least, you need to understand the potential, as hiring managers are increasingly seeking those with AI skills and knowledge.

AI’s status as a mere curiosity for HR did not last very long, but a new Littler Mendelson survey suggests there may still be a significant level of hesitancy from organizations.

            U.S. President Joe Biden hands Vice President Kamala Harris the pen he used to sign an executive order regarding artificial intelligence during an event at the White House on Oct. 30, 2023, in Washington, D.C. Most employer respondents to Littler Mendelson’s survey said they were at least moderately concerned about enforcement from federal agencies in the near term.

Dive Brief:

U.S. employers in an annual Littler Mendelson survey exhibited a nearly 50-50 split on the use of generative artificial intelligence for HR tasks, as 51% said their organizations did not use generative AI for HR while 49% did, according to results published by the law firm Wednesday.
With respect to using AI for HR, most of the more than 400 in-house lawyers, executives and HR professionals surveyed were at least moderately concerned about complying with state, federal and international data protection and information security laws. That contingent included 81% of respondents representing large organizations, Littler said.
Employers were also concerned about employment law enforcement generally, with 8 in 10 stating they expected at least a moderate impact from the U.S. Department of Labor in the next year. Seventy-three percent said the same of the National Labor Relations Board.

Dive Insight:
AI’s status as a curiosity for HR departments did not last very long: The majority of C-suite leaders in a Deloitte survey published last week said they were seeking to change their talent strategies due to AI. That follows reports from other sources that stressed the need for organizations to develop AI-specific strategies for the workplace.
Littler’s survey, however, appears to show that there may still be a significant level of hesitancy in the industry around AI. Of those using generative AI for HR in the survey, the plurality said they were using the technology to craft HR-related materials or for self-service in the form of chatbots.
“Employers should be intentional about their generative AI usage, not only with regard to whether they use it at all, but also how, why and when,” Niloy Ray, shareholder at Littler, said in a press release Wednesday. “Policies governing the safe usage of AI can help protect against inadvertently running up against data privacy, discrimination and other potential vulnerabilities, along with the reputational issues that can stem from AI hallucinations.”

Slim majority of employers not using generative AI for HR
“In which of the following ways is your organization using generative AI to assist with human resources and talent acquisition processes? (Select all that apply)”

Compliance risks in the AI space include the growing number of laws governing use of the tech to evaluate job candidates. At least three jurisdictions have such laws in place, including the states of Illinois and Maryland as well as New York City. At the federal level, the U.S. Department of Labor recently provided guidance around how AI could interact with various employment laws. Others are concerned about the potential diversity, equity and inclusion implications of AI tech.
Still, approximately 52% of all jobs are expected to change significantly due to future integration of generative AI within the next decade, according to a report by Cognizant and Oxford Economics. A February report by the Society for Human Resource Management and The Burning Glass Institute found that the tech will have the most notable effects on companies in the finance, insurance, professional services and information systems industries — with the potential for a “high human cost,” the report said.
A large majority of employers responding to Littler’s survey downplayed concerns about job displacement due to AI, however. Eighty-eight percent said they were either slightly or not at all concerned about this.

Recognizing this, GITEX Africa 2024",N/A,"Artificial intelligence is changing the face of the world, and the African continent is no different. Recognizing this, GITEX Africa 2024",N/A,N/A,N/A,"Artificial intelligence is changing the face of the world, and the African continent is no different. Recognizing this, GITEX Africa 2024 (www.GITEXAfrica.com), the continent’s largest tech and startup exhibition scheduled from 29-31 May in Marrakech, Morocco, will bring strategic leaders, technology pioneers, innovators and industry disruptors together to share insights around the opportunities presented by this groundbreaking technology.With a growing youth population, digital transformation, fuelled by AI, is emerging as key to the continent’s growth. By 2030, young Africans are expected to constitute 42% of global youth (https://apo-opa.co/3yaI27I), representing a formidable potential tech workforce. And countries like Tunisia are leading the way in creating and leveraging the opportunities that AI brings.Sharing Real-world SolutionsDelegates at AI Everything Expo by GITEX Africa 2024 will have the opportunity to hear from business leaders who are actively deploying AI in real-life scenarios, redefining business paradigms, and driving tangible return on investment. Tunisian representation includes speakers such as the country’s Minister of Communication Technologies, His Excellency Dr. Nizar Ben Neji, and Olaya Bahloul Ghenia, Chief Information Security Officer at the Tunisian Company of Electricity and Gas (STEG). Country exhibitors include software companies FININFO SOLUTIONS, and Axe Finance, both in the digital finance show sector.Tunisia provides a shining example of how embracing artificial intelligence provides unique opportunities to catalyze economic growth and foster job creation. Through its many initiatives aimed at leveraging AI to the benefit of the country, it is making a firm investment in developing a prosperous and technologically advanced future for its citizens.Leading the Way in AI AdoptionTunisia has emerged as a leader in AI development and adoption, harnessing the potential of AI as an enabler of economic growth and incorporating it into various aspects of the country’s economy. With close to 10 million internet users (https://apo-opa.co/3JPIY47), representing internet penetration of almost 80 percent, the country’s digital maturity places it in a strong position when it comes to embracing new technologies such as AI.With its strong commitment to education, innovation and entrepreneurship, Tunisia is already making use of artificial intelligence to enhance various economic sectors. For instance, from agricultural solutions that optimize irrigation systems, to using AI to develop sustainable animal feed alternatives, the agritech industry is making significant strides. Tech companies are making AI technology readily available to users in the country, while online booking platforms are enhancing the tourist experience.Government Commitment to Developing AI skillsThe Tunisian government is also actively promoting AI development through initiatives like the national AI strategy (https://apo-opa.co/3JRSTGo); innovation hubs such as Elgazala Technopark, aimed at fostering collaboration between academia, industry, and startups; and training and education initiatives that are equipping the workforce with necessary skills.In addition, the country is actively hosting and engaging in events aimed at broadening access to innovative AI technologies. For example, 2024 sees the eighth edition of the Tunisia Digital Summit, which discusses digital technology trends, including AI, with industry leaders, policymakers, and entrepreneurs. Similarly, Hackathon Tunisia encourages participants to develop innovative AI solutions for real-world problems. Under the High Patronage of His Majesty King Mohammed VI of the Kingdom of Morocco, GITEX AFRICA is held under the authority of the Moroccan Ministry of Digital Transition and Administration Reform, and hosted by the Digital Development Agency. The 2nd blockbuster edition, organised by KAOUN International, follows its pioneering debut in 2023.More information is available at www.GITEXAfrica.com.Distributed by APO Group on behalf of GITEX Africa.Media Contact: Gareth Wright – PR Director  Tel.: + 971 50 273 3832  Gareth.Wright@dwtc.com Tayce Marchesi – PR Executive Tel.: + 971 58 552 3994 Tayce.Marchesi@dwtc.comOn social media: Facebook: https://apo-opa.co/3JwCSp0 Instagram: https://apo-opa.co/3Qjatqj Twitter: https://apo-opa.co/3w8Pbom LinkedIn: https://apo-opa.co/3QluZGW Youtube: https://apo-opa.co/3UdDFAb Hashtag: #GITEXAFRICA Website: www.GITEXAfrica.comAbout KAOUN International: KAOUN International is the independent events company and wholly owned subsidiary of Dubai World Trade Centre (DWTC) established to organize and manage events internationally.

Three in four workers are using generative AI in the workplace, according to the 2024 Work Trend Index Annual Report by Microsoft and LinkedIn, with 46% saying they started using AI in the last six months. Ninety percent of workers reported using AI saves them time, and 84% said it helps boosts creativity so employees can focus on other work. Meanwhile, 78% of employees across age groups said they are bringing their own AI tools into the office. 

Microsoft and LinkedIn surveyed 31,000 people across 31 countries, and analyzed labor and hiring trends to collect data for the report.

“AI is democratizing expertise across the workforce,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement. “Our latest research highlights the opportunity for every organization to apply this technology to drive better decision-making, collaboration — and ultimately business outcomes.”

One driver of employees using AI tools at work is a struggle to keep up with the pace and volume of their work, with 68% of respondents reporting this challenge and 48% of workers saying they feel burned out.


But 53% of surveyed workers said they are worried that using AI at work for important tasks “makes them look replaceable,” while 52% said they are reluctant to disclose they are using AI at work. Forty-five percent of workers said they fear AI will replace their jobs.

Employers are also worried about AI, but in different ways. While 79% of surveyed business leaders said adopting AI is important to staying competitive, 59% reported feeling worried about quantifying productivity gains from AI. And 60% reported feeling worried their company’s leadership “lacks a plan and vision to implement AI.” 

Despite employees’ fears of being replaced by generative AI, the Microsoft and LinkedIn survey found that 66% of business leaders said they wouldn’t hire a person without AI-related skills. And 71% said they would rather hire a less experienced employee with AI skills, rather than a more experienced candidate who lacked AI knowledge.

Internal talent marketplaces are getting smarter, thanks to generative AI. 
Companies like telco group Verizon and management consultancy PwC are using new technologies that signpost what internal job opportunities are available and relevant to their employees, and match which workers would best suit certain roles, based on their skill sets and career paths. 
While some companies have been cultivating their internal talent marketplaces for years, others are just getting started, as businesses prioritize upskilling and retaining internal talent rather than overhiring. And the integration of generative AI into these marketplaces, has meant that leaders can view which employees match the skill sets for internal job openings much faster, taking into account more information related to the specific career goals and paths of individuals. 
A total 30% of large enterprises will have deployed an internal talent marketplace by 2025, according to Gartner.  “This is one of the best use cases for AI and talent management right now,” said Colleen Malley, senior principal analyst in the Gartner HR function who focuses on talent management. However, only 15% of these will fully roll it out to all employees and use cases.
“If you’re looking at driving retention, in addition to using technology to draw out new information, there’s also the art of acting on it,” said Malley. “So when employees are getting access to this data and you’re able to do an analysis with it, but you don’t, you’re going to lose that trust and confidence from employees. Make sure that you’re taking that action, communicating it out thoroughly, receiving feedback, and adjusting it over time.”

We spoke with leaders at Verizon and PwC to better understand how they’re doing just that.
PwC’s My Marketplace
At the end of 2023, PwC launched “My Marketplace,” a talent marketplace that uses AI technology to provide leaders with increased visibility to what talent they have across the firm and connects its over 75,000 employees to new skills and opportunities within the organization.  

“It allows our employees to learn about the types of work we do, understand how their skills link to different roles, identify areas to upskill and expand their networks,” said Yolanda Seals-Coffield, PwC’s chief people officer.
So far, it’s available to its U.S. employees and almost half of them have explored the platform. 
It’s a win-win for both employees and leaders, stressed Seals-Coffield. The platform gives PwC’s leaders increased visibility to more talent, both within and outside of their immediate teams or personal networks. 
“We are hopeful that My Marketplace helps us better allocate resources, broaden access to talent based on skills and drive sustained client outcomes,” said Seals-Coffield. “We are also monitoring the impact of the tool in several different areas, and as more time passes will have a better idea of its influence on the specific areas of our business.”

Meanwhile, My Marketplace allows employees to provide their preferences in the projects, types of work and new skills they’d like to work on, “giving them an active role in their career journey,” said Seals-Coffield. Employees who use My Marketplace will see client engagements, strategic needs, internal mobility, and global mobility opportunities both within and outside of their teams. 
My Marketplace is part of a larger initiative at PwC called MyAI, a $1 billion, three-year investment in generative AI that reflects the firm’s commitment to upskilling its workforce by ensuring its employees are savvy and responsible users of this new technology. Since its launch in 2023, more than 95% of the firm has engaged with My AI. 
“Our ‘client zero’ approach is a proving ground for AI and technology use cases, where we’re leveraging our investments to transform our own firm so we can share those lessons, and create similar opportunities, with our clients,” said Seals-Coffield.
Verizon’s AI-focused vision this year
This year Verizon is doubling down on using AI to help with talent management. It’s part of a multi-year initiative, referred to internally as Journey Forward, to provide more resources and development opportunities.
Verizon already claims a very slow staff churn. Of its 110,000 employees worldwide, the average amount of time someone remains at the company is 12.9 years, according to the company. But to ensure that figure remains sustainable it’s investing heavily in using AI to further improve internal mobility for employees. 
The first phase began with job architecture, also known as taxonomy, which groups job attributes and ultimately helps identify an employee’s progress and standing, and maps out what potential growth opportunities there could be for that person based on what’s available within the company. It has also launched an online job library from which employees can access information about Verizon roles. 
So far, the plan has paid off. Verizon’s 2023 VZPulse+ survey, which had an employee participation rate of 88%, showed results that ranked in the 83rd percentile in overall employee engagement, 82nd percentile for a culture of inclusion, and 76th percentile in overall satisfaction compared to Gallup’s company-wide database.
Now, it’s about focusing on how to use AI to make all of that just a little bit easier. 
“This year, we’re harnessing the power of AI and tech,” said Ashley Walvoord, Verizon’s associate vp of talent management. “We can say ‘Hey, you were interested in this, here’s what it takes, here’s what you have, here’s some ideas for how we can invest in you to get you there, or have you thought about this job over there.’ You don’t need to come up with the right keywords, we’ll share them with you and see if you’re interested.”







            ""We can say ‘Hey, you were interested in this, here’s what it takes, here’s what you have, here’s some ideas for how we can invest in you to get you there, or have you thought about this job over there.’""

It’s giving them the skills needed for a job and the kinds of learning and opportunities that might be a good match for them, added Walvoord. Generative AI can help employees get answers about things more efficiently, more productively, and overall enhance the employee experience.
In the long term, Verizon plans to start researching how generative AI can be used to help people be more effective with how they give each other feedback, not just limited between manager and employee, but to provide a culture of feedback all around. Additionally, the company’s goal is to ensure that all employees know how to harness AI to have clarity on their priorities and goals. 
“This is a space where I think AI starts to level the playing field in how we work,” said Walvoord. “When you focus on how it can support the how, and you keep the employee in the decision-making chair, it’s all about elevating what their impact can be. I think that’s really exciting.”

Most business today can be described as MORE—more technology, more meetings, more projects, more data, and more documents. Coupled with the increasing expectations to do more with less, it’s a lot for knowledge workers to handle. In fact, according to MIT Sloan, 80 percent of knowledge workers experience information overload and it’s impacting productivity. Adobe’s Future of Digital Work survey reported that knowledge workers waste nearly a full day (8.2 hours) a week just looking for information they need to do their jobs. 
A lot of that information resides in documents like contracts, financial filings, white papers, sales decks, and research reports. Most of the data in those documents (80-90%) is unstructured, making it especially difficult to analyze and action. Generative AI presents an incredible new opportunity to empower every knowledge worker to get more value from their documents and work more productively. However, deploying generative AI across the organization quickly, yet in a secure and compliant way can be challenging for IT leaders. 
Trust meets value
For more than 30 years, the world’s largest organizations have trusted Adobe Acrobat with their most important information. When it comes to generative AI, we know enterprises need technologies that provide fast time-to-value and meet their security and governance requirements. That’s why we’ve introduced Acrobat AI Assistant for our enterprise customers, a generative AI-powered conversational engine that can be quickly and safely deployed and used. AI Assistant can be deployed in minutes — and used in a familiar environment for employees. And because the features only work on documents users provide, they align to companies’ existing governance processes. We supplement LLM technologies with our own IP, greatly enhancing the quality and reliability of the output and prohibit third-party LLMs from storing, using or training on our customers’ data. And like other Adobe AI features, AI Assistant is developed and deployed according to our AI Ethics principles.
We rolled out AI Assistant to our own employees and they became early adopters of the technology. This fast time to value has been exciting to see, as our employees are discovering faster ways to do their best work. As a result, a range of use cases has started to emerge. The following are a few real-world examples of how our teams are using AI to turn document data into actionable insights and free up time for more valuable tasks.

Marketing and communications: Creating compelling content at scale

Today’s marketing professionals are voracious consumers and producers of content. They read research reports, white papers, and media coverage to stay up-to-date and then produce an ever-increasing amount of content to keep both internal and external audiences informed and engaged. Research suggests that 2-4 blog posts a week is ideal to keep interest in the brand high – and social channels require even more fresh content. 
Employees from our marketing team are saving 5+ hours each week using Acrobat AI Assistant to get insights quicker and consolidate and format information into different types of assets – from executive updates to blogs to social posts – using clickable citations to verify the information is correct. 
2. Sales: Closing bigger deals – faster – and nurturing customer relationships
For sales teams to be successful, they need to deeply understand customer pain points, opportunities, and industry trends so they can create personalized pitches for new customers and customized solutions to help existing customers evolve their business. 
To do that, our sales teams spend a lot of time sifting through complex and lengthy documents like annual reports and 10-Ks for key insights like a customer’s mission, recent financial performance, risks, roadmap, and longer-term objectives. The team started using AI Assistant to summarize the most important points from the documents and ask specific questions to inform their pitches. They also used generative AI to quickly locate and verify details on topics like security practices and information governance in highly technical documents for customer RFPs, and to generate content like email summaries for their teams or summaries for slide decks. With AI, our sales team can now do the same work in about 4 hours or half the time it normally took them – opening opportunities to work with more prospects and customers. 
3. Finance: Analyze reports and provide timely recommendations 
Adobe’s finance team spends hours each week on tasks like reading financial statements, earnings, and industry reports, summarizing recommendations for internal clients, creating reports and blogs based on their analysis and creating emails to update their colleagues. By leveraging AI Assistant to do things like summarize earnings highlights, create first versions of blog posts and draft emails, each employee can save about 7 hours each week and get timely information to stakeholders much quicker.
4. Legal: Promptly access impact of new regulations and save time toward compliance
Our legal teams and compliance officers are charged with tracking and understanding a growing number of new regulations affecting the business. They also need to communicate key points to executives, which requires distilling complex information and removing legal jargon. AI Assistant is helping Adobe’s legal team streamline these processes by instantly generating synopses of regulations, distilling key takeaways, and then automatically formatting them into emails, reports, or slides – cutting time they normally spent in half.
5. Research & development: Stay on top of industry trends
At Adobe, our investment in R&D drives our innovation and growth. R&D’s job is to keep themselves and product teams current on the lates industry and technology trends. This requires a tremendous amount of reading and summarizing information to share with the department and cross-functional teams, and for inclusion in product requirement documents. Without AI Assistant, each researcher could spend more than 10 hours each week reading and summarizing information. Leveraging generative AI, they’ve been able to reduce that down to just four hours a week. 
Generative AI is an incredibly exciting new technology and it’s exciting to see it transform from a curiosity into providing real value for knowledge workers across just about every role. To learn more about Acrobat AI Assistant, visit here.

One year ago, generative AI burst onto the scene and for the first time since the smartphone, people began to change the way they interact with technology. People are bringing AI to work at an unexpected scale — and now the big question is, how’s it going?
As AI becomes ubiquitous in the workplace, employees and businesses alike are under extreme pressure. The pace and intensity of work, which accelerated during the pandemic, has not eased, so employees are bringing their own AI to work. Leaders agree AI is a business imperative — and feel the pressure to show immediate ROI — but many lack a plan and vision to go from individual impact to applying AI to drive the bottom line.
At the same time, the labor market is set to shift and there’s a new AI economy. While some professionals worry AI will replace their job, the data tells a more nuanced story — of a hidden talent shortage, more employees eyeing a career change, and a massive opportunity for those willing to skill up.
“AI is democratizing expertise across the workforce,” said Satya Nadella, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Microsoft. “Our latest research highlights the opportunity for every organization to apply this technology to drive better decision-making, collaboration — and ultimately business outcomes.”
For our fourth annual Work Trend Index, out today, we partnered with LinkedIn for the first time on a joint report so we could provide a comprehensive view of how AI is not only reshaping work, but the labor market more broadly. We surveyed 31,000 people across 31 countries, identified labor and hiring trends from LinkedIn, analyzed trillions of Microsoft 365 productivity signals and conducted research with Fortune 500 customers. The data points to insights every leader and professional needs to know — and actions they can take — when it comes to AI’s implications for work.
1. Employees want AI at work — and won’t wait for companies to catch up.
Three in four knowledge workers (75%) now use AI at work. Employees, overwhelmed and under duress, say AI saves time, boosts creativity and allows them to focus on their most important work. While 79% of leaders agree AI adoption is critical to remain competitive, 59% worry about quantifying the productivity gains of AI and 60% worry their company lacks a vision and plan to implement it. While leaders feel the pressure to turn individual productivity gains into organizational impact, employees aren’t waiting to reap the benefits: 78% of AI users are bringing their own AI tools to work. The opportunity for every leader is to channel this momentum into ROI.
2. For employees, AI raises the bar and breaks the career ceiling.
We also see AI beginning to impact the job market. While AI and job loss are top of mind for some, our data shows more people are eyeing a career change, there are jobs available, and employees with AI skills will get first pick. The majority of leaders (55%) say they’re worried about having enough talent to fill open roles this year, with leaders in cybersecurity, engineering, and creative design feeling the pinch most.
And professionals are looking. Forty-six percent across the globe are considering quitting in the year ahead — an all-time high since the Great Reshuffle of 2021 — a separate LinkedIn study found U.S. numbers to be even higher with 85% eyeing career moves. While two-thirds of leaders wouldn’t hire someone without AI skills, only 39% of users have received AI training from their company. So, professionals are skilling up on their own. As of late last year, we’ve seen a 142x increase in LinkedIn members adding AI skills like Copilot and ChatGPT to their profiles and a 160% increase in non-technical professionals using LinkedIn Learning courses to build their AI aptitude.
In a world where AI mentions in LinkedIn job posts drive a 17% bump in application growth, it’s a two-way street: Organizations that empower employees with AI tools and training will attract the best talent, and professionals who skill up will have the edge.
3. The rise of the AI power user — and what they reveal about the future.
In the research, four types of AI users emerged on a spectrum — from skeptics who rarely use AI to power users who use it extensively. Compared to skeptics, AI power users have reoriented their workdays in fundamental ways, reimagining business processes and saving over 30 minutes per day. Over 90% of power users say AI makes their overwhelming workload more manageable and their work more enjoyable, but they aren’t doing it on their own.
Power users work for a different kind of company. They are 61% more likely to have heard from their CEO on the importance of using generative AI at work, 53% more likely to receive encouragement from leadership to consider how AI can transform their function and 35% more likely to receive tailored AI training for their specific role or function.
“AI is redefining work and it’s clear we need new playbooks,” said Ryan Roslansky, CEO of LinkedIn. “It’s the leaders who build for agility instead of stability and invest in skill building internally that will give their organizations a competitive advantage and create more efficient, engaged and equitable teams.”
The prompt box is the new blank page 
We hear one consistent piece of feedback from our customers: talking to AI is harder than it seems. We’ve all learned how to use a search engine, identifying the right few words to get the best results. AI requires more context — just like when you delegate work to a direct report or colleague. But for many, staring down that empty prompt box feels like facing a blank page: Where should I even start?
Today, we’re announcing Copilot for Microsoft 365 innovations to help our customers answer that question.

If you’ve got the start of a prompt, Copilot will offer to auto-complete it to get to a better result, suggesting something more detailed to help ensure you get what you’re looking for. That not only speeds things up, it offers you new ideas for how to leverage Copilot’s power.

Other times, you know exactly what you want — you’re just not sure how to ask. With its new rewrite feature, Copilot turns a basic prompt into a rich one with the click of a button, turning everyone into a prompt engineer.

Catch Up, a new chat interface that surfaces personal insights based on your recent activity, provides responsive recommendations, like “You have a meeting with the sales VP on Thursday. Let’s get you prepared — click here to get detailed notes.”
We also know that every role, team and function has unique needs and ways of working. To help create prompts for exactly the work you do, you’ll soon be able to create, publish and manage prompts in Copilot Lab that are expressly tailored to your closest teams.

These features will be available in the coming months, and in the future, we’ll take it a step further, with Copilot asking you questions to get to your best work yet.
LinkedIn has also made free over 50 learning courses to empower professionals at all levels to advance their AI aptitude.

Microsoft and LinkedIn’s annual Work Trend Index reveals the state of AI at work, the cultural shifts at play and what businesses and employees need to know.
A year since generative AI arrived on the landscape, Microsoft’s fourth annual Work Trend Index – its first collaboration with LinkedIn – provides a comprehensive view of how AI is reshaping work and the labour market. To coincide with the report, Microsoft has also announced new innovations in Copilot for Microsoft 365 with guidance on how to create prompts and tailored support.
The Work Trend Index combines survey data from 31,000 knowledge workers and leaders across 31 countries, as well as trillions of productivity signals, telemetry data and LinkedIn jobs and labour data to show how AI is taking hold in the workplace.
Lucy Debono, Modern Work Business Director, Microsoft Australia and New Zealand, says 2024 is the year AI at work will become “real”.
“Organisations that apply AI to drive growth, manage costs, and deliver greater value to their customers will pull ahead. The data also shows that AI will play a major role in the labour market, with greater value placed on AI – both as a skillset and aptitude among job seekers, and for its ability to reshape workflows so employees can enjoy their work more.”
The Work Trend Index reveals three key themes:
 

Employees want AI at work – and won’t wait for companies to catch up

New Zealand workers are among the strongest adopters of generative AI in the workplace, with 84% using the technology at work, higher than the global average of 75%. Employees who are using AI say it, saves time, boosts creativity, and allows them to focus on their most important work.
However, the rapid uptake means New Zealand leaders are more worried that their organisation lacks a plan and vision to implement AI (74% of New Zealand leaders, versus 60% of global leaders).
While leaders agree AI adoption is critical to remaining competitive, employees often aren’t waiting to be formally trained or introduced to the tools via their IT departments and leadership teams. 81% of AI users in New Zealand are bringing their own AI tools to work. The challenge (and opportunity) for every leader is to channel this momentum into return on investment, through a cohesive AI strategy.
 

AI skills are giving jobseekers the edge

While AI and job loss are top of mind for some, Work Trend Index data shows employees with AI skills will get first pick.
In Australia, LinkedIn research shows 87% of hiring managers plan to hire or expand their workforce this year. However, in New Zealand, unemployment is forecast to rise to at least 5 per cent by the end of 2024.
This makes it even more important for New Zealand workers to upskill. However, only 39% of LinkedIn users, globally, have received AI training from their company.
So, professionals are skilling up on their own. As of late last year, there’s been a 142% increase in LinkedIn members adding AI skills like Copilot and ChatGPT to their profiles and a 160% increase in non-technical professionals using LinkedIn Learning courses to build their AI aptitude.
“Leaders have made their land grab for technical AI talent – with hiring up 323% globally in the last eight years. Now they’re turning their sights to non-technical talent with AI-aptitude. While leaders recognise the value of bringing on new employees with these skills, they’re missing the value of developing their own people by investing in AI tools or products for their teams and implementing training that’s specific to their industry and employees’ job functions,” says Matt Tindale, Managing Director, LinkedIn Australia and New Zealand.
 

The rise of the AI power user – and what they reveal about the future

Through the Work Trend Index research, four types of AI users emerged– from sceptics who rarely use AI, to power users who use it extensively. Compared to sceptics, AI power users have reoriented their workdays in fundamental ways, reimagining business processes and saving over 30 minutes per day.
Approximately 8 in 10 Kiwi power users frequently start their day with AI or use it to get ready for the following day, in line with the global average of 85%. Over 90% of power users say AI makes their overwhelming workload more manageable and their work more enjoyable.
However, the data shows New Zealand is behind other countries on engagement from business leadership. Power users in New Zealand are 36% more likely than the average worker to have heard from their CEO (compared to 61% globally), and 33% more likely to have heard from their function or department lead (compared to 40% globally), on the importance of using generative AI at work. This could be holding New Zealand back from driving greater ROI on AI investments.
The data also shows New Zealand workplaces need to encourage a culture of greater AI experimentation and training. Only 33% of power users in New Zealand say they are experimenting with different ways of using AI (compared to 68% of global AI power users); and just 24%  are frequently asking co-workers what prompts they find most useful (versus 40% globally). AI power users in New Zealand are also about 10% less likely to receive training on how to use AI for their specific role or function compared to global AI power users.
New innovations in Copilot for Microsoft 365 provide help with prompts 
Many Microsoft customers have shared that writing the right AI prompts is the hardest part.
As part of the Work Trend Index launch, Microsoft has introduced Copilot for Microsoft 365 innovations to help customers add greater context to their AI prompts and get more from the generative AI technology. Over the coming months, auto-complete and rewrite features will be added to help improve prompts, along with a “catch-up” function that automatically suggests how to prepare for upcoming meetings. A Copilot Lab feature will also provide prompts tailored to specific teams and work duties.
Interested to level up your AI skills? LinkedIn has made free over 50 learning courses to empower professionals at all levels to advance their AI aptitude.

Velasquez said the quality of the fake checks and letters has improved because of artificial intelligence.Read: Car owners suing Subaru, saying their cars accelerated without them touching the gas pedal“It doesn’t take any time, and it costs very little for the scammers to develop picture and letter-perfect templates and online profiles. So, it looks very, very legitimate,” Velasquez said.Those A.I. generated job scams can be much more dangerous than typical phishing emails.Crooks use A.I. to scrape your personal information, then create and send a targeted attack.Read: Stolen EBT funds: How secure are these cards?Using Becker’s Action News Jax bio, we asked ChatGPT to write a customized remote job offer letter. It even mentions some of Becker’s awards and states he can work from the comfort of a home studio.Another part of the scam can include links within the offer letter asking victims for more information. Clicking those links can download malware or steal your private information to use against you or sell on the dark web.How to protect yourself According to the Federal Trade Commission, there are ways to protect yourself:Verify the job ad.Visit the official company website and apply there instead.Google the company with words like “scam,” “review,” or “complaint.”If a company sends you a check, asks you to deposit it, and return part of the money, it’s a scam.Synterex Statement:“Unfortunately, like many other companies, Synterex was targeted by a scammer who digitally impersonated us in early 2023. When we first became aware of the scam, we immediately published a post on LinkedIn to warn current and future clients as well as partners and team members that bad actors were using our brand name to ‘recruit’ new hires using unofficial email addresses. Since then, we have taken extra measures such as creating an official Glassdoor account and reporting any accounts that were impersonating us. We filed a formal complaint with IC3 back in 2023, though we have yet to hear back from any relevant authority or jurisdiction regarding this matter. Our team also took the extra step and responded to each person we could verify had been scammed via email to let them know that the requests came from a non-Synterex domain so they would cease communications with the scammers.“Our hearts go out to any applicant who spends time applying for a job only to find out the process was not real. We understand how involved the talent acquisition process can be. It is disheartening, to say the least, to see applicants who are excited about the potential to work for these companies have their time and resources stolen, or worse. That’s why we are always working to elevate our digital security measures to combat this type of threat.”Click here to download our free news, weather and smart TV apps.

In the future, will data analysts find themselves unemployed due to generative AI displacing jobs? Not quite. However, many roles in this space should expect major changes to their duties as businesses dramatically rethink their approach to data analytics in response to the generative AI revolution. How will this happen?
Background: What Do Data Analytics Teams Do?
Let's begin by exploring the tasks typically performed by a data analytics team in a business that hasn’t yet adopted generative AI for enhancing analytics capabilities.

Traditionally, data analysts focused on integrating various data sources within a given organization and then creating queries to enable business stakeholders to answer questions based on their data. This process was often complex and time-consuming, for several reasons.

One reason was the challenge of mapping disparate data sources together and implementing the necessary data transformations to query all of them in a consolidated fashion. This task required deep expertise in data integration and analytics, consuming much of analysts' time.

A second issue was that the initial queries rarely fully answered a business stakeholder's question, due to the difficulty in determining exactly what information the stakeholder wanted. As a result, queries became iterative processes, with analysts having to tweak queries and generate new reports repeatedly until they finally arrived at the desired answer.

In short, traditional data analyst roles have revolved around complex data integration and querying tasks. The work tends to be tedious and time-consuming, and it becomes even more challenging as the scale and diversity of data assets within a business increase.
How Generative AI Can Change Data Analytics
Generative AI, however, is poised to fundamentally change data analytics processes.

The main reason is that generative AI models can allow business stakeholders to ask and answer data-centric questions without relying on data analysts to write queries for them. As long as a generative AI model has access to relevant data sources, it can accept questions in natural language form and then generate appropriate data queries based on them. This is precisely one of the use cases that solutions like Amazon Q are designed to address.

For the data analyst role, this approach to querying data has two profound implications. One is that it reduces the importance of creating data inventories and maps. Instead of integrating disparate data sources in the traditional way – which entailed manual effort on the part of data analysts – businesses can simply expose all of their relevant data to generative AI models and let them decide how to query it.

In addition, a generative AI-based approach to data analytics makes it possible to iterate and refine queries much faster than teams could if they relied on analysts to write queries manually. Instead of a time-consuming process where a data analyst and a business stakeholder hold a back-and-forth conversation, and the data analyst writes multiple queries and reports in an attempt to provide the answers the business stakeholder seeks, the stakeholder can interact directly with a generative AI service to ask a question in different ways until the service produces the right answer.

This isn't to say that generative AI can interpret business needs any better than human data analysts. Natural language queries are always ambiguous, for generative AI models and humans alike. The advantage that generative AI has in this context is its ability to iterate faster and to generate new versions of an answer in a matter of seconds instead of hours.
The Future of Data Analyst Jobs
None of this is bad news for data analysts who may be worried about their jobs. On the contrary, although generative AI is likely to upend core elements of the traditional data analytics function within many businesses, it will make data analysts' jobs more rewarding and important in other ways.

Instead of spending most of their time on data integration and querying, analysts within a business that adopts generative AI as the basis for analytics will shift toward work that caters to enabling generative AI. Analysts will take the lead in model training, for example. They'll also play key roles in enforcing data governance and security policies, which shape which data generative AI models can and can't access – or, in cases where highly granular levels of access are necessary, data analysts will help enable controls that allow certain users to access certain data via generative AI services, which may not be available to other users of the same service.

This work will likely be more rewarding than the tedium of writing queries. It will also involve acquiring new data management skills – which is why data analysts who want to get ahead of the generative AI revolution should now be focusing on upskilling in this realm.
Conclusion: A Bright, but Different, Future for Data Analysts
If you're a data analyst living through the generative AI revolution, now's the time to rethink your role and the value you bring to business. Gone are the days when the ability to integrate data sources and write complex queries was the be-all and end-all of the data analytics function. Going forward, capabilities related to supporting and managing the data paradigms that power generative AI models will become central.

Ultimately, the work that data analysts perform in the brave, new, generative AI-centric world is likely to be more interesting and rewarding, and it will certainly be quite different from traditional data analytics tasks.

However, the executives are wary that generative AI could wipe out several entry-level roles, and customer care roles are expected to be severely affected.While firms anticipate new hires, a cross-section of respondents have expressed fears over the difficulty of sourcing top talent, with job candidates obfuscating their skills using AI and other emerging technologies.“Companies are reshaping their workforce to be more AI savvy,” said Vamsi Duvvuri, EY Technology, Media and Telecommunications AI Leader. “With this transition, we can anticipate a continuous cycle of strategic workforce realignment, characterized by simultaneous layoffs and hiring, and not necessarily in equal volumes.”Despite the hiring spree, the poll revealed an upward trend of employees turning to generative AI offerings to improve workplace productivity and efficiency. 72% of executives confirm AI use cases within their organization, with employees leaning on the offerings for coding, internal communication, and data analysis.Apart from challenges around hiring and layoffs, respondents say they are treading with caution over fears of security breaches and data leaks from AI use. Following this, nearly 90% of respondents are pushing for internal guardrails to promote safe usage, while a majority say tighter regulations will mitigate associated risks.Other areas of concern include copyright infringement, the steep cost of upskilling employees, and AI-generated bias, but respondents opine that the benefits significantly outweigh the downsides.A changing workforceSeveral studies are forecasting changes to the global workforce due to generative AI adoption. One report by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) notes that while productivity is poised to spike by 40%, advanced economies are at a higher risk of job losses from automation.Another study by IBM (NASDAQ: IBM) says that nearly two billion individuals will require new AI skills to remain competitive in the workplace. Per the report, the seismic upskilling drive will affect finance, procurement, marketing, and customer service employees.In order for artificial intelligence (AI) to work right within the law and thrive in the face of growing challenges, it needs to integrate an enterprise blockchain system that ensures data input quality and ownership—allowing it to keep data safe while also guaranteeing the immutability of data.

Yet 60% of leaders say their organization doesn’t have a clear plan and vision to use the technology, according to the report, and many companies aren’t providing explicit training about how to use AI, amid general uncertainty about how AI tools like Microsoft’s Copilot can best be used in the workplace.“We’ve come to the hard part of any tech disruption, moving past experimentation to business transformation,” said Colette Stallbaumer, GM of Copilot and cofounder of Microsoft’s WorkLab, in a recorded press briefing.One challenge is that although tools like Copilot have a flexible, conversational interface, it still takes a bit of time to learn how to prompt the AI to get the best results. And until workers are confident they know ways to actually boost their productivity with the technology, it’s easy for them to fall back on their “muscle memory” and stick with familiar ways of getting their work done, says Jon Friedman, CVP, research & design at Microsoft.“It turns out, it’s harder than it sounds to do things like, ask Copilot to write an email for you versus write it yourself,” Friedman tells Fast Company. “One of the things that we found is, we really need to help people get good at prompting.”A potential solution that the company plans to roll out to Copilot users in the coming months is more AI—specifically, built-in AI that can help users craft prompts for Copilot. Autocomplete options, similar to those users are familiar with from search engines, will pop up as people begin to write prompts for the main Copilot, suggesting options like comparing two files or asking for a catch-up on incoming emails. Then, when people pick a suggested prompt or write their own, an optional prompt rewrite tool will be able to turn simple instructions, like “summarize this document,” into more detailed requests specifying more details, like desired content and formatting.Like other AI output, Friedman says users will be able to edit and iterate on the expanded prompts themselves to change details about what they want Copilot to do. But even if people begin by trying out the suggested prompts verbatim, they’ll be getting more exposure to the kinds of detailed, conversational requests that Friedman says tend to generate the best results. “Merely putting in front of people the kinds of prompts that do create more successful outputs will get people to think about if they change one word, or two words in one sentence, what might happen,” he says.That kind of training may make a difference: Microsoft’s survey found that people the company calls “AI power users,” who use the technology several times a week and report it saves them more than half an hour of labor a day, are 56% more likely than other users to research and try new prompts and 68% more likely to frequently experiment with new ways to use AI. They’re also more likely to have received encouragement and training around AI at work.With Microsoft’s research finding that 78% of AI users are “bringing their own AI” software of choice to use on the job, building that some of that encouragement and training into AI itself might help more users build confidence with the technology and incorporate it more into their daily routines.

Chen and Cade MetzTripp Mickle, Brian X. Chen and Cade Metz have been reporting on Apple’s plans for generative A.I. for this article since the fall of 2023.May 10, 2024Apple’s top software executives decided early last year that Siri, the company’s virtual assistant, needed a brain transplant.The decision came after the executives Craig Federighi and John Giannandrea spent weeks testing OpenAI’s new chatbot, ChatGPT. The product’s use of generative artificial intelligence, which can write poetry, create computer code and answer complex questions, made Siri look antiquated, said two people familiar with the company’s work, who didn’t have permission to speak publicly.Introduced in 2011 as the original virtual assistant in every iPhone, Siri had been limited for years to individual requests and had never been able to follow a conversation. It often misunderstood questions. ChatGPT, on the other hand, knew that if someone asked for the weather in San Francisco and then said, “What about New York?” that user wanted another forecast.The realization that new technology had leapfrogged Siri set in motion the tech giant’s most significant reorganization in more than a decade. Determined to catch up in the tech industry’s A.I. race, Apple has made generative A.I. a tent pole project — the company’s special, internal label that it uses to organize employees around once-in-a-decade initiatives.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTApple is expected to show off its A.I. work at its annual developers conference on June 10 when it releases an improved Siri that is more conversational and versatile, according to three people familiar with the company’s work, who didn’t have permission to speak publicly. Siri’s underlying technology will include a new generative A.I. system that will allow it to chat rather than respond to questions one at a time.The update to Siri is at the forefront of a broader effort to embrace generative A.I. across Apple’s business. The company is also increasing the memory in this year’s iPhones to support its new Siri capabilities. And it has discussed licensing complementary A.I. models that power chatbots from several companies, including Google, Cohere and OpenAI.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.Apple executives worry that new A.I. technology threatens the company’s dominance of the global smartphone market because it has the potential to become the primary operating system, displacing the iPhone’s iOS software, said two people familiar with the thinking of Apple’s leadership, who didn’t have permission to speak publicly. This new technology could also create an ecosystem of A.I. apps, known as agents, that can order Ubers or make calendar appointments, undermining Apple’s App Store, which generates about $24 billion in annual sales.Apple also fears that if it fails to develop its own A.I. system, the iPhone could become a “dumb brick” compared with other technology. While it is unclear how many people regularly use Siri, the iPhone currently takes 85 percent of global smartphone profits and generates more than $200 billion in sales.That sense of urgency contributed to Apple’s decision to cancel its other big bet — a $10 billion project to develop a self-driving car — and reassign hundreds of engineers to work on A.I.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTApple has also explored creating servers that are powered by its iPhone and Mac processors, two of these people said. Doing so could help Apple save money and create consistency between the tools used for processes in the cloud and on its devices.Rather than compete directly with ChatGPT by releasing a chatbot that does things like write poetry, the three people familiar with its work said, Apple has focused on making Siri better at handling tasks that it already does, including setting timers, creating calendar appointments and adding items to a grocery list. It also would be able to summarize text messages.Apple plans to bill the improved Siri as more private than rival A.I. services because it will process requests on iPhones rather than remotely in data centers. The strategy will also save money. OpenAI spends about 12 cents for about 1,000 words that ChatGPT generates because of cloud computing costs.(The New York Times sued OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft, in December for copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems.)

Behind the JournalismOur business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.Here’s more on our standards and practices.But Apple faces risks by relying on a smaller A.I. system housed on iPhones rather than a larger one stored in a data center. Research has found that smaller A.I. systems could be more likely to make errors, known as hallucinations, than larger ones.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“It’s always been the Siri vision to have a conversational interface that understands language and context, but it’s a hard problem,” said Tom Gruber, a co-founder of Siri who worked at Apple until 2018. “Now that the technology has changed, it should be possible to do a much better job of that. So long as it’s not a one-size-fits-all effort to answer anything, then they should be able to avoid trouble.”Apple has several advantages in the A.I. race, including more than two billion devices in use around the world where it can distribute A.I. products. It also has a leading semiconductor team that has been making sophisticated chips capable of powering A.I. tasks like facial recognition.But for the past decade, Apple has struggled to develop a comprehensive A.I. strategy, and Siri has not had major improvements since its introduction. The assistant’s struggles blunted the appeal of the company’s HomePod smart speaker because it couldn’t consistently perform simple tasks like fulfilling a song request.The Siri team has failed to get the kind of attention and resources that went to other groups inside Apple, said John Burkey, who worked on Siri for two years before founding a generative A.I. platform, Brighten.ai. The company’s divisions, such as software and hardware, operate independently of one another and share limited information. But A.I. needs to be threaded through products to succeed.“It’s not in Apple’s DNA,” Mr. Burkey said. “It’s a blind spot.”Apple has also struggled to recruit and retain leading A.I. researchers. Over the years, it has acquired A.I. companies led by leaders in the field, but they all left after a few years.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe reasons for their departures vary, but one factor is Apple’s secrecy. The company publishes fewer papers on its A.I. work than Google, Meta and Microsoft, and it doesn’t participate in conferences in the same way that its rivals do.“Research scientists say: ‘What are my other options? Can I go back into academia? Can I go to a research institute, some place where I can work a bit more in the open?’” said Ruslan Salakhutdinov, a leading A.I. researcher, who left Apple in 2020 to return to Carnegie Mellon University.In recent months, Apple has increased the number of A.I. papers it has published. But prominent A.I. researchers have questioned the value of the papers, saying they are more about creating the impression of meaningful work than providing examples of what Apple may bring to market.Tsu-Jui Fu, an Apple intern and A.I. doctoral student at the University of California, Santa Barbara, wrote one of Apple’s recent A.I. papers. He spent last summer developing a system for editing photos with written commands rather than Photoshop tools. He said that Apple supported the project by providing him with the necessary G.P.U.s to train the system, but that he had no interaction with the A.I. team working on Apple products.Though he said he had interviewed for full-time jobs at Adobe and Nvidia, he plans to return to Apple after he graduates because he thinks he can make a bigger difference there.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“A.I. product and research is emerging in Apple, but most companies are very mature,” Mr. Fu said in an interview with The Times. “At Apple, I can have more room to lead a project instead of just being a member of a team doing something.”Tell us how your law firm is using A.I.We’d like to hear from lawyers working with generative A.I., including contract lawyers who have been brought on for assignments related to A.I.

Now comes the hard part"", was released on Wednesday, May 8. It claimed that in the last six months, the use of Artificial Intelligence has “nearly doubled.” The research was “based on a survey of 31,000 people across 31 countries, labour and hiring trends on LinkedIn, trillions of Microsoft 365 productivity signals, and research with Fortune 500 customers.”The research discovered that 75 per cent of “knowledge workers” across the globe use AI in the workplace. It added that the employees, who struggle to keep up with the pace and the volume of the work, believe that “AI saves time, boosts creativity, and allows them to focus on their most important work.”It is worth noting that while 79 per cent of leaders agree that “AI adoption is critical to remain competitive”, 59 per cent “worry about quantifying the productivity gains of AI.”On the other hand, about 60 per cent claim that their company lacks a vision and plan to implement it.The report noted that 78 per cent of AI users are bringing their own tools to work —""Bring Your Own AI (BYOAI)”It added, “A majority of leaders (55%) are concerned about having enough talent to fill roles this year with leaders in cybersecurity, engineering and creative design feeling the pinch most. And professionals are looking. Forty-six per cent across the globe are considering quitting in the year ahead — an all-time high since the Great Reshuffle of 2021.”The research found “Four types of AI users” — from skeptics who rarely use AI to power users who use it extensively.“Over 90 per cent of power users say AI makes their overwhelming workload more manageable and their work more enjoyable, but they aren't doing it on their own. These users are 61 per cent more likely to have heard from their CEO on the importance of using generative AI at work, 53 per cent more likely to receive encouragement from leadership to consider how AI can transform their function, and 35 per cent more likely to receive tailored AI training for their specific role or function,” added the report.LinkedIn has witnessed a significant rise in professionals adding AI skills to their profiles. In addition, most leaders, on the other hand, claim that they won't hire an employee without AI skills.The report added, “But with many leaders worried their company lacks an AI vision, and employees bringing their own AI tools to work, leaders have reached the hard part of any tech disruption: moving from experimentation to tangible business impact.”Also ReadTerminal Cancer Patient's Brain Surgery Delayed By Microsoft OutageSamsung’s Future AI Smartphones to Be ‘Radically Different’ From Existing Phones: ReportMicrosoft Reportedly Exploring Cloud-Only, Family Plan and Ad-Supported Xbox Game Pass TiersPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.comTrack Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India  and around the world.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks during a conference in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Thursday, May 2, 2024. Microsoft will invest $2.2 billion over the next four years in Malaysia’s new cloud and artificial intelligence infrastructure as well as partnering with the government to establish a national AI center, Nadella said Thursday.
Having knowledge about how to use artificial intelligence as a skill is becoming more desirable in the Houston area, according to the latest Work Trend Index report from Microsoft and LinkedIn.
More workers are writing AI skills on resumes and applying them to their jobs. According to the report, about 73% of knowledge workers in Houston say they use AI at work. That’s a little above the national average of 71%.
Robert Schapiro is the Microsoft Senior Director of Energy and Resources locally. He said AI can be used in many ways.
“In day-to-day roles, people use AI to do less administrative work, like sifting through emails, and now they have more time to use their creativity and technical skills,” he said.
AI can range from editing software like Grammarly to server robots at hotels and restaurants. Schapiro added that on a national level, there’s been a dramatic increase in LinkedIn users adding skills like ChatGPT and Copilot to their profiles.
At least one local university has been working on various projects and studies to implement AI in different industries. A study from the University of Houston last year found AI could change the way people book reservations. And earlier this year, TxDOT provided a $500,000 grant to the university to look into how highway bridge inspections can be improved with AI.
“A lot of what we do in Houston involves industrial operations with workers in the field who are assessing and fixing equipment,” Schapiro said. “Now, they can use AI that has been trained on their own maintenance manuals and employees can chat with an AI assistant to diagnose and solve issues without having to call back to headquarters.”
Schapiro said around half of Houston-area leaders are still worried their organization’s leadership does not have a plan and vision to implement AI. In addition, regulation both in the U.S. and internationally is still lacking across various industries.
Earlier this year, the European Union approved the first comprehensive artificial intelligence legislation. And last year, some actors’ and writers’ strikes stemmed from concerns about how AI is used in creative industries.
Still, Schapiro said a little over two-thirds of Houston-area leaders believe their company needs to implement AI.
“Organizations that empower employees with AI tools and training will attract and retain the best talent. And professionals who skill up will have the edge,” Schapiro said.
The full report and Houston-area findings can be found online.

Login     Listen to this article 5 min    Jade Rosocha is sometimes embarrassed to admit how often she uses generative artificial intelligence at work.The executive at life insurer TAL uses Microsoft Copilot “maybe every second hour” to transcribe meetings, write emails and help her produce strategic plans.TAL executives Hinesh Chauhan and Jade Rosocha are frequent users of Microsoft Copilot.  Dominic Lorrimer“I don’t use it for scheduling because I’m quite an organised person by nature. [But] I use it to bridge gaps in other capability areas, such as content design and creative work,” said Ms Rosocha, who is TAL’s general manager of infrastructure, operations and service excellence.Ms Rosocha told The Australian Financial Review she also used Copilot – which is embedded in Microsoft Teams and all Microsoft 365 apps – to find action points in emails she might have missed.“I use it to trawl through all of the information in the new emails that may have popped into my inbox, and to give me a summary of anything I should be particularly aware of,” she said.Related QuotesAdvertisementNew research from Microsoft, based on responses from more than 31,000 employees across 31 countries, suggests 84 per cent of knowledge workers in Australia now use generative AI at work, compared with a global average of 75 per cent.But employees such as Ms Rosocha are members of a more exclusive group.These “power users” use generative AI at least several times a week and consequently save more than 30 minutes a day, according to Microsoft.The other common types of AI users are: sceptics, who rarely use AI; novices, who use it a few times each month and say it saves them no more than 30 minutes a day; and explorers, who use it up to once a week and say it saves them between five and 30 minutes each day.Microsoft’s modern work director, Lucy Debono, said a standout finding from the research was that almost nine in 10 power users were “bookending” their day with AI.“They’re showing up and structuring their day with AI, and [also] looking ahead to the next day and using AI to prepare there,” she said.AdvertisementPower users were also 66 per cent more likely than other users to ask AI to redesign their business processes and workflows, 56 per cent more likely to use it to catch up on missed meetings and 51 per cent more likely to use it to analyse information.Other common applications included designing visual content, brainstorming or problem-solving, and using it while interacting with customers.Experimentation is keyBut the No.1 predictor of someone’s power user status was their willingness to experiment with different ways of using AI.“If they use it and don’t get the response or return they wanted the first time, they’ll keep going,” Ms Debono said.Power users were also 49 per cent more likely than others to frequently pause and ask themselves whether AI could help with a task before starting it, and 56 per cent more likely to research and try new prompts.AdvertisementTAL chief information officer Hinesh Chauhan, another self-confessed power user, said experimentation was a key component of the insurer’s gradual adoption of Microsoft Copilot. The company has given the tool to 300 of its 3000 employees.In February, after 12 weeks of using Copilot, six in 10 employees reported the tool had made them more productive, and the same number said it allowed them to focus on more satisfying work. Meanwhile, 58 per cent said they would not want to go back to working without Copilot, up from 38 per cent after four weeks.“One of our goals was to put the technology in the hands of the users very quickly, and to start building a repository of [potential] use cases,” Mr Chauhan said. “Just let them have a crack at it and see how they’re using it, with safety and guardrails in place.”He said employees were saving between one and six hours a week by using the tool, depending on their role, with the greatest time savings enjoyed by workers who analysed, sorted and summarised a high volume of documents.Common applications include asking Copilot to suggest points to consider before joining a meeting, asking for feedback on a presentation and getting the tool to produce different sets of meeting notes for different types of stakeholders.“People are choosing then to spend that time [having] more quality conversations with their customers, their partners, [and there’s] more time for learning and development,” Mr Chauhan said, adding that Copilot was taking on the tasks that employees “would rather not do”.“Our people are self-selecting to do the higher-order, higher-value activities that bring them a bit more joy in their work. So that’s a real advantage of using this technology.”RelatedConsultants using AI do better, especially underperformers: studyRelatedWhat this law firm learnt from experimenting with AIExpert advice for getting ahead in the new world of work left by COVID-19Sign up to our weekly newsletter.Sign Up NowEuan Black is a work and careers reporter at The Australian Financial Review.

Balancing Innovation and Employment: Navigating the Impact of Artificial Intelligence

In the rapidly evolving landscape of technology, the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has sparked both awe and apprehension. While hailed for its potential to revolutionize industries and streamline processes, there’s a growing concern that AI could pose a significant threat to employment generation. This sentiment has ignited a fervent debate among experts and policymakers worldwide.
Proponents of AI argue that it has the capacity to enhance productivity, efficiency, and innovation across various sectors. From automated manufacturing processes to intelligent customer service systems, AI applications promise to streamline operations and unlock new avenues for growth. Advocates often highlight the potential for AI to create new job opportunities, particularly in specialized fields such as data science, machine learning, and robotics.
However, amidst the optimism, skeptics raise valid concerns about the darker implications of widespread AI adoption. One of the most pressing apprehensions revolves around the displacement of human labour by intelligent machines. 
As AI systems become increasingly sophisticated, there’s a looming threat that they could render certain jobs obsolete, leading to widespread unemployment and economic upheaval. The manufacturing industry serves as a poignant example of this phenomenon. With the rise of automated assembly lines and robotic technologies, traditional manufacturing roles have dwindled, leaving many workers displaced. Similar trends are observed across various sectors, including retail, transportation, and customer service, where AI-powered solutions are increasingly replacing human workers.
Moreover, the integration of AI into white-collar professions is raising concerns about the future of knowledge-based jobs. Advanced algorithms and machine learning are increasingly capable of performing tasks that were once exclusive to human intellect, such as data analysis, legal research, and even creative endeavors like content generation. 
This shift poses a significant challenge for workers whose livelihoods depend on cognitive skills and expertise. Critics caution that unless proactive measures are taken to address the potential socio-economic ramifications of AI, the widening gap between technological advancement and employment opportunities could exacerbate inequality and social unrest. As AI continues to reshape the labour market, policymakers face the daunting task of navigating the delicate balance between innovation and job preservation.
In response to these challenges, calls for comprehensive strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of AI on employment are gaining traction. Investing in education and training is paramount for preparing individuals for an AI-driven economy. This involves prioritizing lifelong learning programs that impart technical skills like data science and programming, as well as nurturing critical thinking, adaptability, and creativity. By prioritizing education, societies can ensure their workforce remains agile and equipped to navigate the evolving landscape of work.
Reskilling and upskilling initiatives are vital to help workers transition into new roles that complement AI technologies. Governments and businesses should invest in tailored programs catering to diverse industries and demographics, ensuring inclusivity and preventing anyone from being left behind due to automation. Empowering individuals through reskilling and upskilling opportunities enables them to adapt to changing job requirements and seize new employment prospects.
Ethical AI deployment and robust social safety nets are essential components in shaping a future where AI augments human capabilities while safeguarding against negative impacts on employment. Establishing ethical guidelines and regulatory frameworks ensures responsible AI deployment, mitigating unintended consequences like bias and discrimination. 
Implementing social safety nets such as universal basic income and healthcare coverage provides support for workers facing job displacement, fostering economic stability and facilitating retraining for alternative employment opportunities. Embracing these strategies fosters a culture of innovation, inclusivity, and social responsibility, leading to a more resilient and equitable society for all.
As the debate over the impact of AI on employment rages on, one thing remains clear: the need for a proactive and inclusive approach to harnessing the potential of this transformative technology. 
While AI undoubtedly holds the promise of unparalleled progress, its implications for the future of work must be carefully considered to ensure a sustainable and equitable society in the age of automation. Thus, the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents both immense opportunities and significant challenges for employment generation.
AI has the potential to enhance productivity and innovation across various sectors, there are, however, legitimate concerns about its impact on job markets and economic inequality. To navigate this complex landscape, proactive measures such as investing in education, reskilling initiatives, ethical AI deployment, and robust social safety nets are crucial. By embracing these strategies, societies can harness the transformative power of AI while ensuring a sustainable and inclusive future for all in the age of automation.

In today’s column, I am continuing my ongoing coverage of prompt engineering strategies and tactics that aid in getting the most out of using generative AI apps such as ChatGPT, GPT-4, Bard, Gemini, Claude, etc.


Here’s the deal this time.

I’ve carefully compiled a comprehensive list of the best-in-class prompt engineering techniques and associated skills, aiming to provide you with a quick and easy-to-understand explanation. I’ve also included handy-dandy online links in case you want to learn more. There are a ton of captivating nitty-gritty details that you can dish into.

All told, this is my all-in-one package for those of you who genuinely care about prompt engineering.

Loyal readers might remember my prior recap of prompt engineering techniques, see my detailed discussion at the link here. I covered thirty keystone prompting approaches. You’ll be pleased and hopefully elated to know that this latest incarnation contains fifty essential prompting approaches and incorporates that prior coverage here. As a side note, those added twenty techniques have been detailed in my column and were posted after having done that earlier all-in-one recap.
PROMOTED
Bottom line: You are in the right place now for the big picture on prompt engineering for generative AI.
I will proceed as follows.
First, I will do a brief overview of why prompt engineering is an essential skill when using generative AI. Next, I showcase in alphabetical order the fifty prompt engineering techniques that I believe encompass a full breadth of what any skilled prompt engineer ought to be aware of.

I’d wager that some of these fifty techniques are not necessarily well-known by even those who are profoundly interested in prompt engineering. Thus, to help out, I have at the end of this depiction provided a list of the Top 10 that I humbly proclaim that every sincere and seriously studious prompt engineer ought to know. I guess you could say that the rest of the remaining forty beyond the Top 10 is more so icing on the cake. Well, maybe. I still earnestly believe that any good prompt engineer should at least be comfortably familiar with the whole kit-and-kaboodle (i.e., all fifty techniques).

Okay, now then, if you are desirous of being an all-out prompt engineer, the best of the best, the top banana, here’s my lay-down-the-gauntlet challenge for you.
Are you ready for this?

I trust so.
Go through every prompt engineering technique that I lay out here. Make sure to use the provided online links and fully read the detailed indications that underpin each technique (no skipping, no idle eyeballing). Try extensively using the technique in your favored generative AI app. Quiz yourself to double-check that you really know how to use each technique. Be honest. Be fair and square.
Upon completion of that noble quest, I hereby convey upon you an honorary prompt engineering badge-of-honor and vociferously applaud you for your dedication and persistence in wanting to be the best of the best when it comes to prompt engineering.
Let’s get underway.
The Importance Of Prompt Engineering Is Woefully Understated
My golden rule about prompt engineering is this:


The use of generative AI can altogether succeed or fail based on the prompt that you enter.


If you provide a prompt that is poorly composed, the odds are that the generative AI will wander all over the map and you won’t get anything demonstrative related to your inquiry.
Similarly, if you put distracting words into your prompt, the odds are that the generative AI will pursue an unintended line of consideration. For example, if you include words that suggest levity, there is a solid chance that the generative AI will seemingly go into a humorous mode and no longer emit serious answers to your questions (which, you might aim to intentionally achieve, but this should not be something that catches you unawares or by utter surprise).
I have a helpful rule-of-thumb that I repeatedly cover in my classes on the core fundamentals of prompt engineering. Here it is. Be direct, be obvious, and generally avoid distractive wording when composing your prompts.
Voila, you’ve just learned something about prompting.
Indeed, that’s what prompt engineering is all about. The idea is to abide by tried-and-true prompting techniques, strategies, tactics, and the like, doing so to get the most you fruitfully can out of using generative AI. A whole gaggle of AI researchers have painstakingly sought to perform experiments and ascertain what kinds of prompts are useful. They have also generally identified prompts that are either not useful or, worse still, prompts that will waste your time and effort (plus, if you are paying to use generative AI, will needlessly cost you for the computational processing cycles wastefully consumed).
Getting back to my above recommendation about using direct wording for your prompts, being mindlessly terse should be cautiously employed. You see, being overly sparse can be off-putting due to lacking sufficient clues or information. When I say this, some eager beavers then swing to the other side of the fence and go overboard in being verbose in their prompts. That’s a problem too. Amidst all the morass of details, there is a chance that the generative AI will either get lost in the weeds or will strike upon a particular word or phrase that causes a wild leap into some tangential realm.
Of course, I am not saying that you should never use detailed prompts. That’s silly. I am saying that you should use detailed prompts in sensible ways, such as telling the generative AI that you are going to include necessary details and forewarning the AI accordingly.
All in all, I advocate the decidedly sensible practice of the Goldilocks style of prompting. Do not have porridge that is too hot or too cold. The nature of your prompt should be just right, befitting the circumstance at hand. Thanks go to Goldilocks and those three bears for their clairvoyance about the future and the rise of generative AI and large language models (LLMs).
I like to emphasize at my speaking engagements that prompts and dealing with generative AI is like a box of chocolates. You never know exactly what you are going to get when you enter prompts. The generative AI is devised with a probabilistic and statistical underpinning which pretty much guarantees that the output produced will vary each time. In the parlance of the AI field, we say that generative AI is considered non-deterministic.
My point is that, unlike other apps or systems that you might use, you cannot fully predict what will come out of generative AI when inputting a particular prompt. You must remain flexible. You must always be on your toes. Do not fall into the mental laziness of assuming that the generative AI output will always be correct or apt to your query. It won’t be.
Some naysayers opt to discard prompt engineering because the prompting techniques do not ensure an ironclad guarantee of working perfectly each time. To those malcontents, they seem to dreamily believe that unless a fully predictive tit-for-tat exists, there is no point in learning about prompting. That’s the proverbial tossing out the baby with the bathwater kind of mentality and misses seeing the forest for the trees.
Prompt engineering gives you an edge. An important and quite productive edge.
The techniques and approaches of prompt engineering provide a fighting chance at getting things done efficiently and effectively while using generative AI. Sure, the precepts and recommendations are not a one-hundred percent assurance. Those who shrug their shoulders and fall into random attempts at prompting will end up getting their just deserves. They will likely spin their wheels endlessly and ultimately give up using generative AI in self-disgust. Rather than doing an introspective examination that they opted to toss asunder prompt engineering, they will likely bemoan that generative AI is confusing, confounding, and ought to be avoided.
The thing is, we aren’t going to be able to simply decide to avoid generative AI. Generative AI is becoming ubiquitous. Period, end of story.
Adapt or become roadkill.
There is another oft-speculated claim that there is no need to learn prompt engineering because advances in AI technology are going to make prompting obsolete.
Allow me a moment to address this expressed concern.
Some people say that there is no need to learn about the composing of good prompts. The usual rationale for this claim is that generative AI will be enhanced anyway by the AI makers such that your prompts will automatically be adjusted and improved for you. This capacity is at times referred to as adding a “trust layer” that surrounds the generative AI app, see my coverage at the link here.
The loudly aired opinion is that soon there will be promulgated AI advances that can take the flimsiest of hand-composed prompts and still enable generative AI to figure out what you want to do. The pressing issue therefore is whether you are wasting your time by learning prompting techniques. It could be that you are only on a short-term ticking clock and that in a year or so the skills you homed in prompting will be no longer needed.
In my viewpoint, and though I concur that we will be witnessing AI advances that will tend toward helping interpret your prompts, I still believe that knowing prompt engineering is exceedingly worthwhile.
Here’s why.
First, you can instantly improve your efforts in today’s generative AI, thus, a speedy and valuable reward is found at the get-go. The payoff is immediate.
Second, we don’t know how long it will take for the speculated AI advances to emerge and take hold. Those who avoid prompting improvements of their own volition are going to be waiting on the edge of their seat for that which might be further in the future than is offhandedly proclaimed (a classic waiting for Godot).
Third, I would vigorously suggest that learning about prompting has an added benefit that few seem to be acknowledging. The more you know about prompting provides a nearly surefire path to knowing more about how generative AI seems to respond. I am asserting that your mental model about the way that generative AI works is embellished by studying and using prompting insights. The gist is that this makes you a better user of generative AI and will prepare you for the continuing expansion of where generative AI will appear in our lives.
I hope the above has whetted your appetite for digging into my compiled list of the best of the best for prompt engineering techniques.
Comprehensive List Of Essential Prompt Engineering Techniques
Enough of the preparatory chitchat, some of you are perhaps thinking, let’s get to the brass tacks. Let’s see the bonanza. Show me or step away.
In alphabetical order and without further ado, I present fifty keystone prompt engineering techniques.
Each comes with a brief sentence or two as an explanation of the essence of the technique. I also provide a handy link for the full-on details, including examples. In terms of the naming or phrasing of each technique, there isn’t a standardized across-the-board accepted naming convention, thus I have used the name or phrases that I believe are most commonly utilized. The aim is to try invoking a generalized indication so that you’ll be immediately in the right ballpark of what the technique references.
Have fun.
Here we go.
Add-On Prompting
You can use special add-ons that plug into generative AI and aid in either producing prompts or adjusting prompts. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of add-ons for prompting, see my coverage at the link here.
AI Hallucination Avoidance Prompting
One of the most pressing problems about generative AI is that the AI can computationally make up falsehoods that seem to be portrayed as truths, which is an issue known as AI hallucinations (I disfavor the catchphrase because it tends to anthropomorphize AI, but it is unfortunately caught on as a phrase and we seem to be stuck with it). For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature of AI hallucinations, see my extensive coverage at the link here, the link here, and the link here. **
Beat the “Reverse Curse” Prompting
Generative AI is known for having difficulties dealing with the reverse side of deductive logic, thus, make sure to be familiar with prompting approaches that can curtail or overcome the so-called “reverse curse”. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of beating the reverse curse prompting, see my coverage at the link here.
“Be On Your Toes” Prompting
The phrase “Be on your toes” can be used to stoke generative AI toward being more thorough when generating responses, though there are caveats and limitations that need to be kept in mind when using the prompting technique. For various examples and further detailed indications about “be on your toes” prompting, see my coverage at the link here. **
Browbeating Prompts
A commonly suggested prompting technique consists of writing prompts that seek to browbeat or bully generative AI. You need to be cautious in using such prompts. For various examples and further detailed indications about browbeating prompting, see my coverage at the link here. **
Catalogs Or Frameworks For Prompting
A prompt-oriented framework or catalog attempts to categorize and present to you the cornerstone ways to craft and utilize prompts. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of prompt engineering frameworks or catalogs, see my coverage at the link here.
Certainty And Uncertainty Prompting
You can explicitly indicate in your prompt that you want generative AI to emit a level of certainty or uncertainty when providing answers to your questions. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of the hidden role of certainty and uncertainty when prompting for generative AI, see my coverage at the link here.
Chain-of-Density (CoD) Prompting
A shrewd method of devising summaries involves a clever prompting strategy that aims to bolster generative AI toward attaining especially superb or at least better than usual kinds of summaries and is known as Chain-of-Density (CoD). For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of CoD or chain-of-density prompting, see my coverage at the link here.
Chain-of-Feedback (CoF) Prompting
A variation on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) consists of the Chain-of-Feedback (CoF) prompting technique, which seems to reduce the degree of generative AI hallucinations. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of chain-of-feedback prompting, see my coverage at the link here. **
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been heralded as one of the most important prompting techniques. When you enter a prompt, you invoke CoT by simply telling generative AI to work in a stepwise fashion. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, see my coverage at the link here.
Chain-of-Thought Factored Decomposition Prompting
You can supplement conventional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting with an additional instruction that tells the generative AI to produce a series of questions and answers when doing the chain-of-thought generation. Your goal is to nudge or prod the generative AI to generate a series of sub-questions and sub-answers. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of chain-of-thought by leveraging factored decomposition, see my coverage at the link here).
Chain-of-Verification (CoV) Prompting
Chain-of-Verification (known as COVE or CoVe, though some also say CoV) is an advanced prompt engineering technique that in a series of checks-and-balances or double-checks tries to boost the validity of generative AI responses. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of CoV or chain-of-verification prompting, see my coverage at the link here.
Conversational Prompting
Be a fluent and interactive prompter, while avoiding the myopic one-and-done mindset that many unfortunately seem to adopt when using generative AI. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of conversational prompting, see my coverage at the link here.
DeepFakes To TrueFakes Prompting
You undoubtedly know about Deepfakes, while a different angle involves establishing via generative AI a Truefake, namely a fake version of yourself that is “true” in the sense that you genuinely want to have your fake digital twin devised. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of going from Deepfakes to Truefakes via prompting, see my coverage at the link here.
Directional Stimulus Prompting (DSP) And Hints
Using subtle or sometimes highly transparent hints in your prompts is formally known as Directional Stimulus Prompting (DSP) and can substantially boost the generative AI responses. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of hints or directional stimulus prompting, see my coverage at the link here.
Disinformation Detection And Removal Prompting
The volume of disinformation and misinformation that society is confronting keeps growing and lamentedly seems unstoppable. A notable means of coping consists of using generative AI to be your preferred filter for detecting disinformation and misinformation. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of prompting to detect and mitigate the flow of misinformation and disinformation, see my coverage at the link here.
Emotionally Expressed Prompting
Does it make a difference to use emotionally expressed wording in your prompts when conversing with generative AI? The answer is yes. And there is a logical and entirely computationally sound reason for why generative AI “reacts” to your use of emotional wording. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of emotionally worded prompting, see my coverage at the link here.
End-Goal Prompting
A highly recommended prompting strategy consists of identifying what your end goal is while working in generative AI and aiming to solve or delve into a particular topic or problem of specific interest. For various examples and further detailed indications about end-goal planning, see my coverage at the link here.
Essay-Compression Prompting
Sometimes instead of getting a summary, you want to have an essay compressed, meaning that it contains the same words as the original source but tosses out words that aren’t necessarily needed per se. For various examples and further detailed indications about essay-compression prompting, see my coverage at the link here. **
Fair-Thinking Prompting
You can use clever prompts that will get generative AI to lean in directions other than the already predisposed biases cooked into the AI, aiming to get a greater semblance of fairness in the generated responses. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of fair-thinking prompting, see my coverage at the link here. **
Flipped Interaction Prompting
You can flip the script, as it were, getting generative AI to ask you questions rather than having you ask generative AI your questions. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of flipped interaction, see my coverage at the link here.
Generating Prompts Via Generative AI
Rather than directly composing your prompts, you can ask generative AI to create your prompts for you. This requires knowing what kinds of prompting will get you the best AI-generated prompts. For various examples and further detailed indications about generating prompts prompting, see my coverage at the link here. **
Illicit Or Disallowed Prompting
Did you know that the licensing agreement of most generative AI apps says that you are only allowed to use the generative AI in various strictly stipulated ways? For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature of what is considered illicit prompts (i.e., that you aren’t supposed to use), see my coverage at the link here.
Imperfect Prompting
Imperfect prompts can be cleverly useful. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of imperfect prompts, see my coverage at the link here.
Importing Text As Prompting Skill
There are circumstances involving importing text into generative AI that require careful skill and necessitates the right types of prompts to get the text suitably brought in and properly infused. For various examples and further detailed indications about importing text prompting, see my coverage at the link here. **
Interlaced Conversations Prompting
Most of the popular generative AI apps require that each conversation be distinct and separate from your other conversations with the AI. The latest trend entails allowing for the interlacing of conversations and requires rethinking how you compose your prompts. For various examples and further detailed indications about interlaced conversation prompting, see my coverage at the link here. **
Kickstart Prompting
A wise move when prompting is to grease the skids or prime the pump, also known as kickstart prompting, which involves doing an initial prompt that gets generative AI into the groove of whatever topic or problem you want to have solved. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature of kickstart prompting, see my coverage at the link here. **
Least-to-Most Prompting
Least-to-Most prompting (LTM) is a technique that involves guiding generative AI to work on the least hard part first and then proceed to the harder part (an alternative approach is Most-to-Least or MTL prompting). For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature of LTM and MTL prompting, see my coverage at the link here. **
Macros In Prompts
Similar to using macros in spreadsheets, you can use macros in your prompts while working in generative AI. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of prompt macros, see my coverage at the link here.
Mega-Personas Prompting
Mega-personas consist of the upsizing of multi-persona prompting. You ask the generative AI to take on a pretense of perhaps thousands of pretend personas. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of mega-personas prompting, see my coverage at the link here.
Multi-Persona Prompting
Via multi-persona prompting, you can get generative AI to simulate one or more personas. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of multi-persona prompting, see my coverage at the link here.
Overcoming “Dumbing Down” Prompting
Knowing when to use succinct or terse wording (unfairly denoted as “dumbing down” prompting), versus using more verbose or fluent wording is a skill that anyone versed in prompt engineering should have in their skillset. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of averting the dumbing down of prompts, see my coverage at the link here.
Persistent Context And Custom Instructions Prompting
You can readily establish a context that will be persistent and ensure that generative AI has a heads-up on what you believe to be important, often set up via custom instructions. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of persistent context and custom instructions, see my coverage at the link here.
Plagiarism Prompting
Your prompts can by design or by happenstance stoke generative AI toward producing responses that contain plagiarized content. Be very careful since you might be on the hook for any liability due to plagiarism. For various examples and further detailed indications bout the nature and use of prompts that might stir plagiarism, see my coverage at the link here and the link here. **
Politeness Prompting
A surprising insight from research on generative AI is that prompts making use of please and thank you can stir AI to produce better results. Make sure to use politeness while prompting, though do not go overboard and be judicious in such wording. For various examples and further detailed indications about politeness prompting, see my coverage at the link here. **
Privacy Protection Prompting
Did you realize that when you enter prompts into generative AI, you are not usually guaranteed that your entered data or information will be kept private or confidential? For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of prompts that might give away privacy or confidentiality, see my coverage at the link here.
Prompt Shields and Spotlight Prompting
The emergence of prompt shields and spotlight prompting has arisen due to the various hacking efforts trying to get generative AI to go beyond its filters and usual protections. Here’s a useful rundown of what you need to know. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature of prompt shields and spotlighting prompting, see my coverage at the link here. **
Prompt-To-Code Prompting
You can enter prompts that tell generative AI to produce conventional programming code and essentially write programs for you. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of prompting to produce programming code, see my coverage at the link here.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Prompting
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is hot and continues to gain steam. You provide external text that gets imported and via in-context modeling augments the data training of generative AI. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), see my coverage at the link here.
Self-Reflection Prompting
You can enter a prompt into generative AI that tells the AI to essentially be (in a manner of speaking) self-reflective by having the AI double-check whatever generative result it has pending or that it has recently produced. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of AI self-reflection and AI self-improvement for prompting purposes, see my coverage at the link here.
Show-Me Versus Tell-Me Prompting
Show-me consists of devising a prompt that demonstrates to the generative AI an indication of what you want (show it), while tell-me entails devising a prompt that gives explicit instructions delineating what you want to have done (tell it). For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of the show-me versus tell-me prompting strategy, see my coverage at the link here.
Sinister Prompting
People are using sinister prompts to get generative AI to do foul things such as scams and the like. I don’t want you to do this, but I also think it is valuable for you to know what sinister prompts do and how they work, alerting you to avoid them and not inadvertently fall into the trap of one. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of sinister prompting, see my coverage at the link here. **
Skeleton-of-Thought (SoT) Prompting
Via a prompt akin to Chain-of-Thought (CoT), you tell the generative AI to first produce an outline or skeleton for whatever topic or question you have at center stage, employing a skeleton-of-thought (SoT) method to do so. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of the skeleton-of-thought approach for prompt engineering, see my coverage at the link here.
Star Trek Trekkie Lingo Prompting
An unusual discovery by researchers showcased that using Star Trek Trekkie lingo in your prompts can improve generative AI results. Downsides exist and can undercut your efforts by inadvertent misuse or overuse of this technique. For various examples and further detailed indications about Trekkie prompting, see my coverage at the link here. **
Step-Around Prompting Technique
At times, the prompts that you seek to use in generative AI are blocked by the numerous filters that the AI maker has put in place. You can use the step-around prompting technique to get around those blockages. For various examples and further detailed indications about step-around prompting, see my coverage at the link here. **
“Take A Deep Breath” Prompting
The prompting phrase of “Take a deep breath” has become lore in prompt engineering but turns out that there are limitations and circumstances under which this wording fruitfully works. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of the take a deep breath prompting, see my coverage at the link here.
Target-Your-Response (TAYOR) Prompting
Target-your-response (TAYOR) is a prompt engineering technique that entails telling generative AI the desired look-and-feel of to-be-generated responses. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of TAYOR or target-your-response prompting, see my coverage at the link here.
Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) Prompting
Tree-of-thoughts (ToT) is an advanced prompting technique that involves telling generative AI to pursue multiple avenues or threads of a problem (so-called “thoughts”) and figure out which path will likely lead to the best answer. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of ToT or tree-of-thoughts prompting, see my coverage at the link here.
Trust Layers For Prompting
Additional components outside of generative AI are being set up to do pre-processing of prompts and post-processing of generated responses, ostensibly doing so to increase a sense of trust about what the AI is doing. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of trust layers for aiding prompting, see my coverage at the link here.
Vagueness Prompting
The use of purposefully vague prompts can be advantageous for spurring open-ended responses that might land on something new or especially interesting. For various examples and further detailed indications about the nature and use of vagueness while prompting, see my coverage at the link here.
End of List
Whew, that’s quite a comprehensive list.
It ranged from A to Z (kind of, the last item starts with the letter V, though I was tempted to purposely make a prompting technique name that began with the letter Z, just for fun).
I ask that you mindfully contemplate the list.
Did you see techniques that were akin to seeing old friends?
Did you see techniques that were new to you and caught your attention?
Let’s discuss the list further.
Numbering The Prompt Engineering Techniques While In Alphabetical Order
The above list of prompt engineering techniques was shown in alphabetical order.
I did so for ease of reference. If you perchance knew the name or phrase of a particular prompt engineering technique, I sought to make life easy for you to find the technique by looking alphabetically for it. I didn’t number them because I was worried that the numbering would imply a semblance of importance or priority. I wanted the above listing to seem that all the techniques are on an equal footing. None is more precious than any of the others.
Lamentedly, not having numbers makes life harder when wanting to quickly refer to a particular prompt engineering technique. So, I am going to go ahead and show you the list again and this time include assigned numbers. The list will still be in alphabetical order. The numbering is purely for ease of reference and has no bearing on priority or importance.
There is another reason too for me to number the list. I had earlier suggested that you might want to step by step make sure that you are familiar with each of the prompt engineering techniques.
Here’s how I suggest that you proceed.
I’d recommend that you use the numbered list shown next. Import the list into your favorite spreadsheet.
Make a column that you can mark as to whether you are familiar with the specific technique, do so by using a plain score ranging from 0 to 5, wherein 0 is that you don’t know it at all, while the highest score of 5 is that you know it like the back of your hand. Be straightforward and don’t give a fake score. Put your real score. This list is solely for your own benefit.
Make another column that has a score showing what you want to become in that technique (suppose for example that you start as a self-rated 1 on a particular technique and want to end up at a self-rated 4). Finally, add an additional column that will contain a target date of when you hope to attain the heightened score.
You can now use that spreadsheet as your career planning guide for prompt engineering purposes. Keep it updated as you proceed along in your adventure as a prompt engineer who wants to do the best that you can.
Whether you undertake that treasured challenge or not, here’s the list with numbers shown as pure reference and the list is still in the same alphabetical order as shown above:

It is an impressive list.
I also realize it might seem like a daunting list. I can hear the commentary that this is way too much and there is no possible way for you to spend the needed time and energy to learn them all. You have your day job to deal with. You have work-life balances that need to be balanced. Etc.
Yes, I hear you.
Let’s discuss what I consider to be the ten most important.
My Recommended Top 10 Of The Best You Need To Know
I will next show you my list of the Top 10.
The numbering now does in fact denote a priority or importance.
Please don’t confuse the numbering of the above alphabetical list with the numbering of the below list. The numbers above were for the sake of convenience. The numbers below are for distinguishment of importance or priority.
I still opted to keep the below in alphabetical order. This certainly is highly debatable and you might argue that the Top 10 should be reordered based on their relative position. Sure, I get that. When I next give a public presentation on this matter, I’ll be happy to do such a live rearrangement and we can dexterously debate the sequence at that time.
Here are my Top 10 of the best of the best for prompt engineering techniques:


(1) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting (listed above as L-10).
(2) Chain-of-Verification (CoV) Prompting (listed above as L-12)
(3) Emotionally Expressed Prompting (listed above as L-17)
(4) End-Goal Prompting (listed above as L-18)
(5) Flipped Interaction Prompting (listed above as L-21)
(6) Generating Prompts Via Generative AI (listed above as L-22)
(7) Mega-Personas Prompting (listed above as L-30)
(8) Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Prompting (listed above as L-39)
(9) Step-Around Prompting Technique (listed above as L-45)
(10) Trust Layers For Prompting (listed above as L-49)


I am saying that you should know each of those by heart.
They should be like falling off a log. Roll up your sleeves and get to work. Commit them to memory. Use them daily, as needed.
Allow me a moment to say a bit more. I frankly agonized at coming up with a Top 10. All fifty on the list are, to me, of great merit and well worth knowing. It saddens me to see some in the list of fifty that did not make my Top 10. They are all deserving of being in the Top 10.
So, please do not treat the remaining forty as though they are inconsequential. It would break my heart. If you can, get to know them all.
Conclusion
Lifelong learning.
That’s what everyone is talking about these days. We are told time and again that we need to be lifelong learners. By gosh, I wholeheartedly agree.
This comes up here because the latest and greatest in prompt engineering is constantly changing. There are new ideas brewing. New AI research efforts are pending. It is a glorious time to be using generative AI.
I pledge that I will keep covering prompt engineering and bringing to you the newest prompts, along with whether they work or flop. I’d bet that in the next few months ahead, at least a half dozen new prompts will be identified and garner worthy attention.
Keep your eyes and ears open, and I’ll do my best to make sure you can be a lifelong learner, faithfully and profitably.

The Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) reports that up to eight million workers in the UK could be vulnerable as the technology becomes capable of performing their tasks. But in Cambridgeshire, a company is using AI to try to extend the working life of people with physical jobs. Being a mechanic can be tough on the body. There is a lot of bending, lifting and stretching in order to work underneath vehicles. Jobs like these can lead to muscular-skeletal problems, which cause pain in the back, joints and muscles. In 2022-23 it was affecting 473,000 workers in the UK.Some people are forced to give up jobs they love because of it, but at German Autowerks in Kimbolton they have used AI to try to prevent that.German Autowerks has invested in technology to protect staff from workplace injuryTechnicians were filmed as they carried out their everyday tasks. AI then analysed the video and identified the pressure points and potential problem areas on the body.  The company then used the information to select specific exoskeletons from the open market for staff to wear - they are powered harnesses which take some of the strain of the job away from the body.Technician John McGoughey said the exoskeleton made heavy tasks much easierJohn McGaughey, a technician, said ""after a few minutes it's like wearing clothing, you don't realise it's there"".""A wheel is about 20kg but this makes it feel half the weight, and you can enjoy the work because you're not feeling the aches and pains,"" he said.The AI technology was provided by Hertfordshire-based Stanley Handling, which believed systems such as these would become standard Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) in future - like a hard hat or hi-vis jacket. Andre Jutel said AI technology could help an ""ageing workforce""""It's about protecting people,"" said the company's solutions consultant, Andre Jutel.""There are a lot of difficult manual jobs out there and we have an ageing workforce. The average worker may not be able to retire at 65 - it might have to be 75. This type of technology assists them in working for longer.""But could and should jobs like this be automated instead? Andre Jutel said in some cases it was impossible or impractical, adding: ""Businesses are dynamic. They change and certain tasks aren't needed any more. ""I've seen a £100,000 piece of machinery become redundant in a few months because it's designed for a set purpose. Humans are flexible and adaptable - that's why we think it's better to focus on helping them."" Getty ImagesThe Institute of Public Policy Research said women were likely to be more affected by AI-related job lossesArtificial intelligence already assists workers in many professions. Doctors use it to help diagnose and treat patients, police forces use it to perform admin tasks and free up officers, teachers use it to save time on lesson planning and farmers use it to predict harvesting times. In each of these situations, and with the ergonomic analysis of the mechanics, AI performs tasks faster than a human could - but a person always checks the results. There are concerns that without policy to protect them, many jobs will be lost to AI rather than supported by it. Last year, BT announced plans to replace thousands of jobs with AI technology.Ocado GroupAI is used to help robotic arms grab the correct items at the Ocado warehouse in LutonThe Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) believes that secretarial, customer service and administrative roles are most imminently at risk, which affects a greater proportion of women.  Carsten Jung, senior economist at IPPR, said: ""AI is set to be a game changer for millions of us. Many firms are already investing in it, and it has potential to speed up many more tasks as more businesses adopt it.""A jobs apocalypse is not inevitable - government, employers and unions have the opportunity to make crucial design decisions now that ensure we manage this new technology well. If they don't act soon, it may be too late.""The government wants the UK to be a global leader in AI. The Department for Science Innovation and Technology said: ""AI is helping to make our jobs safer and more satisfying... but we must also prepare for a near future where the most powerful systems are significantly more capable. ""AI can and must remain a force for the public good, and we will ensure that is the case as we develop our policy approach in this area.""Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

Julien Harou’s career started in geology in his current role as a water management and infrastructure researcher now straddles economics and engineering, with a particular focus on using artificial intelligence (AI) to measure Ghana’s future energy needs.Harou is relatively upbeat about progress so far towards achieving sustainable and reliable energy for all by 2030, the seventh of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) agreed by the United Nations in 2015. He points out that from 2015 to 2021, the portion of the global population with access to electricity increased from 87% to 91%, and last year about 30% came from renewable sources.Harou’s research at the University of Manchester, UK, incorporates computer modeling and artificial intelligence design algorithms to balance Ghana’s long term renewable energy and infrastructure needs. But AI also helps to address the environmental and human health impacts. For example, Ghana’s Volta River was dammed in the 1960s to create the Akosombo dam. But its arrival depleted fish stocks and increased weed and algae growth, providing habitat for vectors of waterborne diseases. It’s all about compromise and trade-offs, Harou tells the seventh episode of How to Save Humanity in 17 Goals, a podcast series that profiles scientists whose work addresses one or more of the SDGs.Episodes 7-12 are produced in partnership with Nature Water, and introduced by Fabio Pullizi, its chief editor.

How to Save Humanity in 17 Goals: ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all (SDG 7)
Fabio Pullizi: 00:09Hello, this is How to Save Humanity in 17 Goals, a podcast brought to you by Nature Careers, in partnership with Nature Water.I’m Fabio Pulizzi, chief editor of Nature Water. This is the series where we meet the scientists who have been quietly incrementally working towards the global development targets set by the United Nations in 2015.World leaders pledged to solve a range of economic, environmental and social issues, and the package of 17 Sustainable Development Goals were born.Since then, in a huge effort, thousands of researchers all over the world have been tackling the biggest problems that the planet faces today.In episode seven, we look at Sustainable Development Goal number seven: how to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.And meet an engineer who uses artificial intelligence to help Ghana design its renewable energy future.Julien Harou 01:21Okay, hi, my name is Julien Harou. I’m a professor in water management and infrastructure systems at the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom.I started out as pretty much a pure water resources professor. So I would look to help water companies and countries plan their their water resources and manage them.But very quickly, because of hydropower, I moved into joint water and energy systems. And water is also used for food production. So I somehow grew from water to water, energy, food. The United Nations General Assembly in 2015 developed a series of goals. And goal number seven is the one related to energy. So the formal goal is to ensure access to affordable, reliable and sustainable modern energy for all.And so the question quickly becomes: “Well, are we making any progress to that goal?”Well, actually, the news is relatively good. From 2015 to 2021, the portion of the global population with access to electricity increased from 87% to 91%.So it’s pretty decent, that means there’s a little less than than 10% of people now who don't have access to energy.The other, the other thing that was mentioned was that these goal wants sustainable energy. And what that generally means is renewable energy. So energy that doesn't require burning fossil fuels. And in 2023, about 30% of the global energy generation was from renewable energy sources.These have much lower carbon dioxide emissions. And so this is also a pretty big success, especially since….in the year 2000, so just less than 25 years ago, it was 18%. So the news for SDG goal number seven is actually pretty decent. And things are progressing rapidly.Julien Harou 03:33You can’t study in university water energy food systems, that doesn’t exist. So it’s quite, the people who are in this field, it’s generally a little bit unusual where they come from.So I was actually born in Brazil, grew up and raised in the United States. Then I trained in Belgium, my native country where my parents are from, as a geologist.And then slowly I started working in the in the water field, and then got drawn to civil engineering because I just saw the problems in the world created by infrastructure.So I went back late in life. I was a mature student, and did graduate degrees at Cornell and UC Davis.And there I really started to focus on on water and economics. And so that’s how I got slowly into this area of water, energy, food systems and human natural systems.Recently, I work mostly in Africa and Asia. And looking at how to better manage human natural systems.So, my focus is on countries where the water, the energy and the food system, and the environment are interconnected and interacting and so when you act in one, you affect the the other.The big turning point in my career is I was working on a project for the World Bank evaluating dam investments. So these are reservoirs, hydropower dams in in Nepal. And it occurred to me and to our research group that it was just not possible to evaluate the value of an investment in a hydropower dam if you didn’t consider what it was contributing to the to the wider energy system.So that’s where I stopped being a pure water engineer and moved to, you know, water, energy food systems. Because I found you couldn’t, you couldn’t evaluate how valuable a water asset was an infrastructure asset like a hydropower dam, if you didn’t consider how it was contributing to the energy system at national scale.And for example, what we’re talking about today, renewable energy. You know, hydropower is a renewable source. But it’s a renewable source that comes at a certain cost.You have to flood certain areas, you have to change the way the water regime works. And so there’s some environmental sacrifices there, and potentially human sacrifices.Surprisingly, even though I started my career as a geologist, and I really had no interest in computers whatsoever, I very quickly realized that these human natural systems are very large and very complex. And your brain just can’t wrap itself around the problem. You need computers.So strangely, from geologist, I went to kind of applied computer guy, and spent many years developing these computer simulation tools to represent how the different elements of water energy food systems work together.Finally, this led to artificial intelligence. It turns out, you can connect these simulators to these new artificial intelligence design methods.And you can find really clever ways to develop human natural systems that get lots of benefits and don't have too many negative impacts. So yeah, that was my career in a nutshell. Starting in geology and finishing in economics, engineering and artificial intelligence.There are many ways to generate energy, and water is just one of them. And in fact, people have used water and moving water to help do work throughout history.For many, many years, water was used to drive mills that would grind grain into flour to make bread. So that was the, that was the initial hydropower.Nowadays, we just convert it to electricity. And so the way it works is that water is stored at altitude, it has a lot of potential energy, it’s heavy, and it’s high up and so when it flows down, that will create kinetic energy.And hydropower is simply taking that kinetic energy and using turbines and generators to convert the kinetic energy into the electricity that we use in the electrical grids and power grids.And so essentially, hydropower is this conversion of the energy that’s in water into electricity. The big win from hydropower, and particularly storage hydropower, is that it’s a renewable source because water falls from the sky in rainfall and that water becomes then available. If it’s stored, it becomes available when you need it.Hydropower is both renewable and dispatchable. Dispatchable is a technical term from the energy sector means in summary is that you can turn it off and on when you when you want it.This is not the case for other renewable energy sources. So solar and wind energy are called variable sources or intermittent sources. That means they’re unpredictable, right? You don’t really know when it’s going to be sunny, and you don’t really know when it’s going to be windy, and it can stop being sunny or windy at any time. So that’s why those renewable sources are called variable or intermittent.It just means that there’s they are somewhat unpredictable. So hydropower is the perfect complement to that. And so, you know, that’s, that’s a good thing. It’s a good thing that hydropower is compatible in that way.And it can allow countries to really increase their, the amount of renewables they use, right? If you have a backup of hydropower, you can have more solar, you can exploit more solar and more wind power, because you know, that if all of a sudden those turn off, you can just put on your hydropower.However, that sounds like a perfect solution. But imagine what would happen if the rivers were going up and down just to react to the how much wind and sun there were.You would really change the way rivers look, you know, could become quite dangerous. You would never know if a river is going to be flowing quickly or, or slowly. It wouldn't be great for humans, but also not great for wildlife.So, yeah. So although wind, solar and hydropower can work well together, in practice you have to make sure that you’re not creating a negative impacts on humans and the environment when you when you do use them together.Ghana is a country in West Africa. It has about 32 million people, the area is about the same as as the United Kingdom, perhaps. It’s on the coast. It’s near other countries like Burkina Faso and Nigeria.And the most surprising thing with Ghana is that has the Volta River, which in 1960s, there was a large dam created there.And this dam, called the Akosombo dam, it flooded a part of the Volta River, and created an absolutely huge reservoir that you can see from space. It’s 8500 square kilometres.So it’s just a huge amount of landmass there that was lost. Of course, in exchange for power production.Nowadays, it’s about two thirds of the national production is from thermal sources. So these are things like natural gas and crude oil and diesel. But about one third is still from dams.The other thing happening in Ghana is that they are, like most other countries, rapidly trying to increase the renewable energy there. It’s currently well, because of hydropower, it’s 33%, the solar and wind is quite low now in Ghana, just a few percent.And that is trying to be increased. One issue is that the solar potential is in the north, that’s where it’s quite sunny, in the highlands there. And most of the people live near the coast in the south. Right, so in the 1960s, this really large dam was put in place. Originally, it was mostly for a large aluminum smelter. They wanted to create metal production there, and they needed a lot of energy to do so.What happens is that the whole, the river was really changed to suit their energy needs. And so the dam was operated to favour baseload hydropower. So that means you’re, you’re trying to release the same amount amount of water all the time every day to have that steady supply of energy.And that really wasn’t that great for the environment. The Volta river traditionally would have quite a bit of natural variability, it would have wet seasons, dry seasons. And so when all of a sudden it became the same amount of water flowing all year, it really affected the environment and the ecosystems and that had a few manifestations.For example, the Volta river flows down into the sea, in an estuary. And there the fact that the saltwater and freshwater stopped mixing the way they did meant that there was less fish to be caught, less clams, oysters, and the fish catch was changed and decreased.There was also unfortunately, a lot of growth of weeds and algae. The presence of aquatic weeds along the lakes and also the tributaries that flow into the Akosombo really negatively affected the local human health.These weeds provide habitat for animals like blackflies, or mosquitoes, or snails, that became or that are vectors of waterborne diseases.And there’s unfortunately several diseases that really strongly increased. One called bilharzia, one called river blindness, and malaria as well. You can definitely see how there’s a clear impact healthwise from, from the dam.Julien Harou 13:47We created a computer model of the Ghananian natural and human natural system. And we did that really to try to answer the question: “What infrastructure elements should Ghana pick up over the next 20-30 years?”So how should they get their energy in the future? How should they improve their water supplies? What infrastructure should they put in place? So really, it’s a design problem or an investment problem?And so the computer models were built specifically to answer those questions. And so, we have, you know, one river system model, which, you know, has the Volta River and other of the major rivers and the major dams.Then we had a power system model. This is like, imagine like a network of the of the grid, the electrical grid and you’re representing all the locations where energy is generated and where energy is consumed.And then we also have, you know, the accounting of the benefits that come from water and energy. So every place where you have economic production of some sort like irrigation food production, that’s also represented.And so the model will march along through time. Computer simulation of human natural systems, it's very cool.But it’s been active since the 1960s. So economists, scientists and engineers have been doing that, pretty much since the 1960s.The really cool thing that hapened in the last 10 years is artificial intelligence. You can take your integrated resorce system simulator, which is maybe kind of boring, just a computer tool that tracks resources over time. And you can connect it to AI.You can connect it to artificial intelligence design algorithms. In this case, we use one which is very cool, called evolutionary algorithms.These are algorithms which just imitate evolution. If you look at yourself or your cat, and you will see that evolution produces amazing things.And so we just use the same processes of evolution. And we encode all the potential investments into these genomes.And then we allow these genomes to exist over many generations, and let the population evolve. And so it’s kind of an artificial way to design a system where you kind of trick evolution to not evolve a species, but to evolve an infrastructure system that works very well.And so the evolutionary algorithm and the simulators just work hand in hand. And over millions of generations, they just refined the design.And after a lot of calculations, something that would take you years to do on your laptop, (we do it on supercomputers, of course, or cloud computers), you get these really evolved designs.And these will, these will recommend the synergistic ways that the water system, the energy system, and the food production system and the environmental system, how they can really synergistically and opportunistically work well together.Okay, so the the results of the study were quite interesting. The first thing the artificial intelligence did is it said, “Oh, you know, renewable energy is good, let’s generate a ton of new energy from solar power and wind power.”And so that’s the first thing it tried. It just, you know, full speed on expanding the renewable power from solar and wind.What happened then is that to produce a stable electrical grid, it needed to start having the hydropower just turn on and off.As soon as there was not enough power from wind and sun, the hydropower would just release water.And so what happened is the rivers across Ghana in the computer model became very dangerous. Flashy, flashy rivers, if you willThey would just have high flows, and then they would have low flows. And it would just change all the time. And so that’s not good for the environment. And it's not good for humans who live near the rivers. It is quite dangerous.So in the end, what the computer model found, and what we were able to tease out of these artificial intelligence, a design approach, was a compromise, really.So we looked at the trade-offs between all the performance metrics that we were tracking, all the benefits we wanted from the system. And in the end, it invested in a system that put quite a bit of biogas and solar power in the north of Ghana.A lot of winds near the coast on the southeast of the country where a lot of people live, and then created a whole series of new transmission lines across the country to kind of equalize, and, you know, to make sure that all the energy produced by in these different regions of Ghana, could, could be at the right place at the right time, if you will.And by doing that, really intelligently, it was able to really reduce the damage to rivers. And so the the hydro-peaking, or the kind of artificial river regime, was really reduced very much.In this compromise solution that was found the intermittent renewables, although they could go up to nearly 40%, that was found to be very damaging to the, to the aquatic ecosystems.And so we were able to find a solution that is more like 20 to 30%, you know, because hydropower is already over 30%.So we could get to a system by the 2030s. Ghana would be more than half of its national power would be from a renewable sources, but still it wouldn't have some of these damages that would happen if your only objective was increasing renewables.So we were happy with this compromise solution. It was getting Ghana very quickly by the 2030s to more than half of their national energy from from well over half from renewable sources, and, but without some negative impacts that might happen if you try to do that too quickly.Julien Harou 20:28At the moment the best predictions are that the renewable energy mix by 2030 will be about 42%, which is a very large amount.At the year 2000, it was only about 17%. So going from in 20, you know, in 30 years going from 17% to 42% would really be a huge success for the world.But what I think this study underlined is that because energy systems are linked to other natural resource, or other resource systems like water, food production and the environment, countries and policymakers in the UN and other places need to be very careful to not try to go too quickly and not try to change the way our human natural systems are organized, too quickly, because then you could have all sorts of negative social and economic and environmental impacts.If you try to make the change too quickly, make the transition too quickly to renewable energy, you might create some negative impacts.And so that’s really what this study tried to underline is that you should look at this the whole system, the whole country, or in some cases, in the case of power pools, where countries are working together, you should look synergistically at how the whole energy system can cooperate effectively with the water system, the food production system, the environment, and find solutions that are acceptable for all the different sectors and the regions of the country or the regions of the, or the countries in a multi-country system.We’re pretty excited about this design approach. So it’s really a computer simulation linked to artificial intelligence.It’s an exciting use of of artificial intelligence design. We think that this will make lots of contributions. There’s lots of researchers around the world who are starting to use these these methods.So we’re excited to see this work expanding throughout the world and countries making use of these, these planning and design methods to improve the way they select infrastructure investments.You know, infrastructure is very expensive, it’s there for a long time. And it’s just essential that countries not make mistakes, you know, as they push forward in the energy transition.It’s just very important that they make infrastructure investment solutions, which make the most sense for their people, for their environment, and for their economies, so that you know, they can continue to thrive and they can quickly move towards, towards you know, in the direction of the SDGs in particular SDG number seven, the one on renewable energy and sustainable energy for all.Fabio Pullizi: 23:39Thanks for listening to this series How to save humanity in 17 goals. Join us again next time when we look at Sustainable Development Goal number 8: economic growth and decent work for all.See you then.

UKG to Transform Payroll Reporting with Generative AI




Uncover insights, build reports, and make data-driven decisions by simply asking a question






May 08, 2024 11:05 AM Eastern Daylight Time



LOWELL, Mass. & WESTON, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--UKG, a leading provider of HR, payroll, workforce management, and culture solutions for all people, today announced during the 42nd annual Payroll Congress Convention and Expo that it is transforming payroll reporting with generative AI (GenAI). A leader in AI for HCM, UKG will make it even easier to create payroll reports in UKG Pro by allowing users to uncover insights and curate dashboards with explanations through a simple question and answer interaction.


“Payroll curates one of the richest yet most underutilized datasets in any organization, and firms of all sizes are increasingly seeking to access its deep insights to support data-driven decision-making”Post this

Conversational experiences are a cornerstone of the UKG GenAI strategy. Instead of requiring payroll teams to manually search, review, or audit large datasets for specific information, they can dramatically accelerate the process with a text-based request for information, such as “Show me employees who still receive a physical paycheck?” or “Tell me which employees have reached the social security wage limit?” By further improving a vital business process with GenAI support, accuracy is enhanced while also freeing up time to focus on other strategic priorities that help people and the organization.


“Payroll reporting often feels like seeking a needle in a haystack, and by the time the frantic search for information is over, it’s often too late to take action on the moment,” said Hugo Sarrazin, chief product and technology officer at UKG. “With generative AI, we’re dramatically reducing payroll complexity by making critical payroll data easily searchable and accessible through conversational experiences, while also putting that information into actionable context for payroll teams.”


Beyond benefits to payroll processing and reporting, GenAI is embedded throughout the Pro suite to help all employees, whether frontline or in-office, accomplish more during the flow of their everyday work. In addition to conversational search that understands a user’s language and intent in order to deliver better results, GenAI will also help organizations with:



Summarization: Highlighting common themes and trends from long-form text documents, such as feedback for performance reviews;



Classification: Recognizing various types of data based on content and context in order to identify patterns or provide guidance and recommendations on otherwise hard-to-spot trends; and



Content creation: Learning patterns based on existing data, then using that knowledge to generate new and unique content, such as job descriptions.



The AI in the Pro suite is powered by UKG Bryte, an AI assistant that is part of Pro’s architecture. UKG Bryte is trained on the world’s largest collection of people data, work data, and culture data, including three decades of Great Place To Work® benchmarks and best practices that only UKG has. By deploying an advanced AI approach built around a commitment to ethical utilization and includes UKG Bryte, leading Large Language Foundational Models from Google Cloud, and the customer’s unique data, UKG provides employees at all levels with guidance, recommendations, and proactive nudges grounded in proven strategies.


“Payroll curates one of the richest yet most underutilized datasets in any organization, and firms of all sizes are increasingly seeking to access its deep insights to support data-driven decision-making,” said Pete Tiliakos, principal analyst and strategic advisor at 3Sixty Insights. “Gen AI-enabled, conversational analytic payroll reporting is well-timed and accelerates UKG’s transformative payroll vision, which spans from global scheduling to funding and aims to augment employees, managers, and practitioners for improved workforce and business outcomes.”


UKG pay innovations, such as UKG One View — which provides an industry-first schedule-to-pay solution for multi-national businesses — will be on display from May 7-10 in UKG booth #715 during Payroll Congress.

Generative AI, now front and centre in our digital experiences, is seeing unprecedented uptake. ChatGPT has been one of the fastest growing digital services of all time. Some children use it daily, for example when doing their homework or choosing what to wear. Its capabilities and adoption set off a storm of reactions around the impact and future of AI broadly: from open letters demanding a pause on AI development to calls to protect children against its harmful content. In the face of increasing pressure for the urgent regulation of AI, and schools around the world banning chatbots, governments are asking how to navigate this dynamic landscape in policy and practice.The known issues with AI systems, such as algorithmic bias and a lack of transparency into how they work, are equally applicable to generative AI. It may even amplify some issues – like unpredictable outputs – or introduce new ones. We don’t presume to have the answers. But given the pace of AI development and adoption, there is a pressing need for research, analysis and foresight to begin to understand the impacts of generative AI on children. Here, we explore some of these current opportunities, risks and questions.















UNICEF/UNI441136/Andriantsoarana











What is generative AI and how is it being taken up?Generative AI is a subset of AI that uses machine learning to discover patterns and structure from training data and then generate new data that have similar characteristics. It has a wide range of uses, such as producing content that mimics human-generated output (including text, images, audio and computer code), completing complex planning tasks and exploring the development of new medicines.Data on how children or youth around the world are using generative AI tools are limited, but initial studies indicate it is much more than adults. A small online poll in the US indicated only 30 per cent of parents say they have used ChatGPT compared to 58 per cent of children aged 12-18. Many children reported hiding their usage from parents or teachers. In another US survey, young adults (aged 18–29) who had heard of ChatGPT reported using it more than their older counterparts, and they did so for entertainment, to learn something new and for work tasks.Generative AI can instantly create text-based disinformation that is indistinguishable from, and more persuasive in swaying people’s opinion than, human-generated content.AI is already central to children’s digital environment, through recommendation algorithms or automated decision-making systems, for example. Generative AI will no doubt take an even greater hold of their digital experiences, and at a rapid pace. First, it is being embedded as chatbots, digital assistants, personal assistants and search engines into software and apps already used by children. Snapchat introduced an ‘AI friend’ chatbot to its 375 million daily active users. Snapchat is very popular with children: almost 60 per cent of 13-17-year-olds in the US and almost half of 3-17-year-olds in the UK use it (it is the fourth most popular app in the UK after YouTube, WhatsApp and TikTok). Meta has announced plans to introduce AI agents into every product used by over 3 billion people every day, including Instagram and WhatsApp.Second, generative AI systems are being fine-tuned within specific sectors, potentially enabling more targeted and powerful capabilities. For example, Khan Academy has introduced a personal tutor in its platform that was honed from a general purpose chatbot to one particularly strong in learning conversations.What are some key opportunities and risks for children?With the increasing power and prevalence of AI, it is easy to see the many opportunities that generative AI can potentially offer children and young people directly or indirectly. For example:Personalized learning systems that can explain difficult concepts and help children develop skills, tailored to a child’s specific needs. Additionally, the systems can adapt according to the learning style and speed to maximize the child’s learning experience.Tools to support children’s play and creativity in new ways, like generating stories, artwork, music or software (with no or low coding skills).Enhanced accessibility for children and young people with disabilities who would benefit from new ways to interface and co-create with digital systems.In healthcare, early detection of health and developmental issues as children use the systems directly. Indirectly, generative AI systems can provide insights into medical data to support advances in healthcare.More broadly, the analysis and generative capabilities can potentially be applied in a range of sectors to improve efficiencies and develop innovative solutions that can positively impact children. For example, in the public sector governments could augment citizen engagement channels to allow for additional languages and a mix of text, images or audio exchanges (for people with low levels of literacy).At the same time, there are clear risks that the technology could be used by bad actors, or inadvertently cause harm or society-wide disruptions at the cost of children’s well-being and future prospects.Persuasive disinformation and harmful and illegal content at scale and lower cost. Generative AI can instantly create text-based disinformation that is indistinguishable from, and more persuasive in swaying people’s opinion than, human-generated content. In a test by the Center for Countering Digital Hate, Google’s Bard generated misinformation without disclaimers when prompted on 78 out of 100 false and potentially harmful narratives, including climate, vaccines, LGBTQ+ hate and sexism. AI-generated images are now indistinguishable from – and, in some cases, deemed more trustworthy – than real faces.Looking ahead, synthetic content (for example, misleading deepfake images, audio, video and text) can potentially be personalized to individual users and, as a result, be harder to combat by automated and human moderators. Future generative AI chatbots could be programmed to impersonate humans and adapt in real-time conversations to attempt to persuade real people about issues or urge them to act. A particularly malicious case might be one-on-one chats, where unwitting individuals would be targeted and the chatbot would attend to the person’s concerns or counterarguments directly, thus likely increasing the odds of persuasion.When used by propogandists, generative AI models will likely transform online influence operations, posing a threat to democratic processes.When used by propogandists, generative AI models will likely transform online influence operations, posing a threat to democratic processes. By mimicking human-generated text, generative AI can instantly flood regulatory and legislative systems with automatically composed messages – effectively lobbying for certain interests – and drown out any human input. Meta has reported exponential growth since 2019 in the use of fake profile photos generated by GANs – generative adversarial networks).The deleterious effect of an internet awash with misleading content is an erosion in trust as the authenticity of all content is questioned, including information from UNICEF. With their cognitive capacities still in development, children are particularly vulnerable to the risks of mis/disinformation and a more uncertain, corroded, and harmful disinformation ecosystem is of great concern.Regarding illegal content, generative AI is being used to create photo-realistic child sexual abuse material (CSAM). The AI image generation models, which are open-source and can thus be operated with no protective guardrails, are trained on existing CSAM and photos of children from public social media accounts. While the volume of such content is still relatively small, given how quickly generative AI tools are developing, researchers predict the number of cases will only grow. This would flood law enforcement with new ‘fake’ CSAM, which would not only detract from their ability to handle CSAM depicting real children, but also complicates victim-identification and rescue operations.In addition, a recent FBI alert noted an uptick in reporting of sextortion, including of minors, using AI-generated images. Bad actors use existing photos (for example, from social media accounts) to generate explicit, sexually themed photos (i.e., “deepfakes”) with which to harass and blackmail victims. Reports of other types of scams are also emerging synthetic voices models are being used to con victims by impersonating real people, such as relatives, requesting money.Given the human-like tone of chatbots, where the line between animate and inanimate blurs, what are the impacts on children’s development – and privacy – when they interact with these systems? Research indicates they may influence children’s perceptions and attributions of intelligence, their cognitive development, and social behaviour – especially during different developmental stages.When generative AI confidently makes up false information, what impact does this have on children’s understanding and education, especially if they become increasingly reliant on chat-enabled tools? Generative AI has produced dangerous content: Amazon Alexa advised a child to stick a coin in an electrical socket. Snapchat’s AI friend gave inappropriate advice to reporters posing as children. Snap, the creator of Snapchat, has since put in place tools that attempt to detect “non-conforming” language, including references to violence, sexually explicit terms, illicit drug use, child sexual abuse, bullying and hate speech. However, it remains an issue that many generative AI systems are already live and accessible to children while continuing to produce misleading and harmful content or interactions. More broadly, as children interact with generative AI systems and share their personal data in conversation and interactions, what are the implications for children’s privacy?Modification of children’s behaviour and worldviews – intentionally or not. AI systems already power much of the digital experience, largely in service of business or government interests. Microtargeting used to influence user behaviour can limit and/or heavily influence a child’s worldview, online experience and level of knowledge. As UNICEF has noted, “children are highly susceptible to these techniques which, if used for harmful goals, are unethical and undermine children’s freedom of expression,” freedom of thought and right to privacy. Whereas current algorithms often promote sensationalist content to maximize attention, generative AI chatbots posing as real people could first gain children’s trust and, over time, influence them in more subtle ways for commercial or political gains. The online battleground could thus “shift from attention to intimacy,” according to historian and philosopher Yuval Noah Harari. He is concerned that bad actors could use AI bots to manipulate real users in hidden and persuasive ways.Another professor, Seth Lazar, warns that we can expect the same challenges with search engines and social media platforms shaping people’s worldview, social interactions and experiences, only now pitched as an “agent that really knows you, and can engage with you in natural language.” Even when there isn’t bad intent, research on the use of generative AI systems to write essays shows that the biases in the models nudge users towards or against certain views in the writing process. The result is that students might be unconsciously pushed to take on certain views when using AI systems to help them learn.Disruption to the future of work upending education provision today. AI combined with robotics first impacted blue collar work in factories through automation of predictable and repetitive tasks. In recent years, the scope of labour market exposure to AI systems has widened to some professional spheres. Now it is predicted that the daily work of teachers, telemarketers and professionals in legal services and securities, commodities and investments – amongst others – will see high exposure to generative AI tools. More research and foresight are needed to anticipate the impacts of generative AI in the workplace. Its potential disruption has great relevance for children’s future work life, as well as how and what education is provided to them today.We know that since emerging technologies are not evenly distributed within and between countries, they have the potential to aggravate existing inequalitiesAside from the future, work practices in today’s AI supply chain are questionable. The quality of AI systems is dependent on accurately labeled and annotated training data, which is prepared by humans. Gig workers, often based in developing countries, assess video clips for sexual content, rate chatbot responses, identify objects within images, and upload selfies of various facial expressions, amongst other tasks. These jobs are low paying, stressful, unpredictable, unrecognized and shrouded in secrecy to protect Big Tech companies that run AI systems, bringing into question whether they constitute ethical and decent work.Aggravation of existing inequalities around the digital divide, with some children more at risk from the harmful effects of generative AI and unable to help shape its development and access its benefits. We know that since emerging technologies are not evenly distributed within and between countries, they have the potential to aggravate existing inequalities. Generative AI is no exception. Equitable, inclusive and responsible generative AI needs to cater to the different contexts and developmental stages of all children, especially those from marginalized communities, and be available to every child when beneficial. If children’s data is used to shape generative AI systems, the collection and processing of their data must be done responsibly, with clearly defined purposes, and safely, regardless of where the data come from. This will not happen through market forces alone, but only by regulation and actively addressing power imbalances and digital exclusion. UN Secretary General António Guterres believes that guardrails, grounded in human rights, transparency, and accountability, are needed to ensure that AI development “benefits all.”While this list of opportunities and risks is far from exhaustive, it illustrates that the impacts of generative AI will be wide-ranging and demand a pro-active response from those who regulate and develop AI – and related data – systems so that these empower and protect children. It also highlights the critical need for a strong advocacy and education investment to ensure that communities, children, parents, teachers, policymakers and regulators are able to engage in meaningful conversation with tech companies towards child-centred AI.Children will experience an increasingly high level of exposure to AI systems over the course of their lives, with impacts in childhood having long-term effects. Addressing their needs is critical. Looking further ahead, the way AI is shaped today will have significant bearings on future generations. As noted by Guterres, “present generations have a responsibility to ‘halt and prevent developments that could threaten the survival of future generations … [including] new technologies’”. Concerns around the future of AI-enabled warfare are particularly crucial to address.As a starting point, existing AI resources provide much direction for responsible AI today. For example, UNICEF’s Policy Guidance on AI for Children has nine requirements to uphold children’s rights in AI policies and practices and the World Economic Forum’s AI for Children toolkit provides advice to tech companies and parents. But advances in generative AI mean existing policies must be interpreted in novel contexts, and new guidance and regulations may need to be developed.Policymakers, tech companies and others working to protect children and future generations need to act urgently. They should support research on the impacts of generative AI and engage in foresight – including with children – for better anticipatory governance responses. There needs to be greater transparency, responsible development from generative AI providers and advocacy for children’s rights. Global-level efforts to regulate AI, as called for by UN Secretary-General António Guterres, will need the full support of all governments.

A key finding was that 75% of knowledge workers worldwide are already using generative AI. While some executives lament the slow uptake by workers of internally supplied generative AI solutions, they aren’t seeing the broader trend of shadow AI use. The report found that 78% of knowledge workers bring their own AI (BYOAI) to work. For GenZ, the figure is 85%. However, even Baby Boomers are BYOAI at a rate of 73%. This suggests that the behavior is broad-based. The implications of these findings are threefold: Workers are clearly seeing benefits from using generative AI.Companies that don’t successfully provide approved and integrated generative AI solutions are not fully accessing the potential value and are increasing risks that customer data or security issues will arise through unmonitored AI use. The trend of worker use of AI will be hard to reverse.Humans Will Find a WayHumans are natural problem solvers. This is particularly true when it impacts their livelihoods. The report identified several generative AI adoption drivers that indicate generative AI has become the solution to a festering problem for knowledge workers.Email overload is a continuing problem68% of employees said they struggle with the pace and volume of work69% say AI can help get them promoted faster, and  79% say AI skills broaden theirjob opportunities76% of people say they need AI skills to remain competitive in the job marketWhether or not employers are rolling out generative AI tools, the ease of access and tangible benefits of time savings and quality improvement are making the adoption inevitable. Wherever there are words that need to be read, transformed, or created, you are likely to see generative AI adoption. Workers want to streamline their tasks, and AI is helping them get through work overload, which is often the result of information overload. Employers Want Generative AI Skills A final point on generative AI adoption in the enterprise. Employers are starting to preference candidates with AI skills. Microsoft found that 66% of business leaders would not hire someone without AI skills and that they intend to use the technology to augment the capabilities of early-career employees. Whether it is to cope with high workloads, achieve more in their role, or simply look attractive to prospective employers, generative AI is becoming commonplace among knowledge workers. That adoption trend is very likely to expand and deepen.

The 2024 Work Trend Index Annual Report from Microsoft and LinkedIn has highlighted that employees today want AI at work and that this trend is visible across industries.  More employees are adopting Generative AI tools for work, often without the knowledge or official sanction of the employers. Based on the report, 75 per cent of ‘knowledge workers’ globally are using Generative AI. This pool of users includes 85 per cent Gen Z staff and 73 per cent boomers. The report also stated that as many as 53 per cent of AI users worry that if their employer finds out, it could signal they are replaceable.  Despite this widespread under-the-radar adoption, many companies are struggling to understand AI. 66 per cent of leaders say they wouldn't hire someone without AI skills, yet only 39 per cent provide training for it, and 60 per cent of leaders worry their AI strategies are insufficient. As employees grapple with the volume of work and expected pace of execution, they are bringing their own AI to work. Based on the report, ‘bring their own AI’ here means employees using AI tools that have not been sanctioned by the companies. While most business leaders admit that AI is imperative for business, most of them believe their organisations lack the vision and planning to apply AI to their workflows. ""The pressure to show immediate ROI is making leaders inert, even in the face of AI inevitability."" 3 out of 4 people use AI at work According to the report, 75 per cent of people are already using AI at work, while 46 per cent of them started using AI less than six months ago. 78 per cent of the respondents brought their own AI to work. This shows that without proper guidance from the top, employees are taking matters into their own hands and using AI under wraps. As many as 52 per cent of people who use AI at work are reluctant to admit to using it for their most important tasks. This shows how companies are missing out on the benefits that come from strategic AI use at scale. It also puts company data at risk in an environment where an organisation’s biggest concern is cybersecurity and data privacy.  AI is setting the bar high From the employer's perspective, 66 per cent of leaders have admitted they would not hire someone without AI skills. This shows how acquiring AI skills has become key for jobseekers. Even though job loss is one of the major concerns with the rapid proliferation of AI, the report offers a balanced view.  As many as 55 per cent of leaders expressed concern about having enough talent to fill roles. These leaders hail from across functions, however, a majority (60 per cent or higher) are from cybersecurity, engineering, and creative design.  When it comes to working professionals, 45 per cent worry AI will replace their job, 46 per cent said they are considering quitting in the year ahead (higher than 40 per cent, who said the same in 2021). While many leaders said they won’t hire someone without skills, 71 per cent said that they would rather hire a less experienced person with AI skills than a more experienced candidate without them.  The report also highlighted the rise of AI power users. These are users who use generative AI at least several times a week and save at least 30 minutes a day with that. The way forward Based on the rapid adoption of AI and current trends, companies should work across leadership on plans for AI skills and guardrails rather than overlooking the technology. While employees are acknowledging AI’s benefits with productivity, using it secretly shows fears about obsolescence. Even as generative AI trickles down across organisations, companies must adapt to stay ahead. ",,,,"{'@type': 'PostalAddress', 'streetAddress': 'Express Building, B-1/B, Sector-10', 'addressLocality': 'Noida', 'addressRegion': 'India', 'postalCode': '201301'}",The Indian Express,en,"{'@type': ['CreativeWork', 'Product'], 'name': 'IE Premium', 'productID': 'indianexpress.com:showcase'}",,,,,2024,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/themes/indianexpress/images/indian-express-logo-n.svg', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'width': 600, 'height': 60, 'caption': 'The Indian Express'}",,,,,1932,"['https://www.facebook.com/indianexpress', 'https://twitter.com/IndianExpress', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/indian-express', 'https://www.instagram.com/indianexpress/', 'https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJEDFSxHHOW1PpBccdSxOTA']","{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://indianexpress.com/?s={search_term_string}', 'query-input': 'required name=search_term_string'}",,,https://schema.org/NewsMediaOrganization,News,2024-07-23,"{'type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'https://indexpress.page.link/shareDL'}",JOURNALISM OF COURAGE,"{'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+91-120-6651500', 'areaServed': 'IN', 'availableLanguage': 'English', 'hoursAvailable': {'opens': '09:30', 'closes': '18:30'}}","{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Ramnath Goenka', 'url': 'https://indianexpress.com/ramnath-goenka/', 'sameAs': 'https://indianexpress.com/ramnath-goenka/'}","{'@type': 'QuantitativeValue', 'value': 153}","{'@type': 'AdministrativeArea', 'name': 'Noida, India'}","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/AI-jobs-1.jpg', 'caption': 'The current wave of AI has also made it important for jobseekers to be equipped with AI skills.

The impact of artificial intelligence on America’s economy has proven far more limited than doomsayers predicted. Some researchers now say the technology could help low-skilled workers more than it will hurt them. “People learn how to be productive with the technology,” says Daniel Keum, a management professor at Columbia University. “But again, the bad news hits first.”

Artificial intelligence, while eliminating some jobs, may improve productivity and lead to better customer satisfaction. Its effect on the U.S. economy so far has proved more moderate than expected. 
Tech sector layoffs surged in 2023 as Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, and Microsoft poured billions of dollars into AI. In February, Swedish consumer finance firm Klarna announced that AI was now handling two-thirds of its online customer chats, doing the work of 700 full-time agents. The company still relies on human workers to handle complex or sensitive cases. Displaced workers may find new jobs, but those posts may now pay less. That’s happening now for a new class of well-educated workers.Ultimately, AI may improve productivity of customer support workers and lead to better customer satisfaction and reduced worker turnover, says Erik Brynjolfsson, director of Stanford University’s Digital Economy Lab.“The tools [of AI], when used correctly, will help rebuild the middle class and will help create more widely shared prosperity,” he says. 


The 2023 predictions were scary. Artificial intelligence would:
Replace 300 million full-time jobs worldwide over time.
Encroach on tasks of 2 in 5 workers.
Drive a bigger wedge between rich people and poor people.
So far, the impact of AI on the U.S. economy has proven far more limited. Examples of massive layoffs are less frequent than some expected. Some researchers now say the technology could help low-skilled workers more than it will hurt them. New technology always brings change and some people will lose their jobs even as new opportunities appear. But if the process unfolds over decades rather than a few years, then many employees and employers have time to adjust.

“Disruption is something we’ve seen over and over,” says Daniel Keum, a management professor at Columbia University. “Over time, new industries emerge. People learn how to be productive with the technology. ... But again, the bad news hits first.”Jay Johnson, who works in advertising in Chicago, was laid off recently. His industry is pushing hard to incorporate AI chatbots, which understand and generate humanlike speech, to analyze marketing trends and generate ad copy. As the sole provider for his wife and his two young children, he’s now looking for another job.“Challenges always exist,” he says. “It’s how we adapt and move through them.”How companies are incorporating AICompanies are adopting the new technology in various ways. Some emphasize efficiency.

In March, IBM disclosed a “workforce rebalancing,” reportedly in marketing and communications, that will lay off several thousand employees. Another multinational company is using AI to step up its marketing game in South America, says Dr. Keum. Instead of launching one marketing campaign per month per country, it now targets specific consumers within those countries and updates the plans weekly.

Workers at a Medicaid call center review information regarding eligibility determinations Aug. 16, 2023, in Jefferson City, Missouri. Some companies are beginning to use artificial intelligence, or ""AI assistants,"" to handle online chats with customers.

 One sector feeling the heat: customer service. In February, Swedish consumer finance firm Klarna announced that AI was now handling two-thirds of its online chats with customers, doing the work of 700 full-time agents. Since the company uses contractors, Klarna didn’t have to fire anybody. It announced a hiring freeze instead. The company still relies on experienced workers to handle complex or sensitive cases, according to a spokesperson. It’s this human-machine collaboration – rethinking and redesigning work in light of AI – that will separate winners from losers, says Erik Brynjolfsson, director of Stanford University’s Digital Economy Laboratory and co-founder of Workhelix, a consulting firm. In a research paper published last year, he and six co-authors found that the introduction of an AI assistant not only improved productivity of customer support workers at a large software firm, but also led to better customer satisfaction and reduced worker turnover. Moreover, the technology didn’t drive a wedge between the most- and least-skilled workers; it instead helped bridge the knowledge gap, Dr. Brynjolfsson adds. AI boosted productivity for new workers and the least skilled workers by 34%, while it had negligible effects for the most skilled. By investing in retraining and work redesign, while keeping people in charge, “you can create a huge amount of value for the customers,” he says. “That is a pretty optimistic story.”Where job losses are landing Which story is winning out – layoffs or happier, more productive employees – is hard to discern.Tech sector layoffs surged in 2023 as Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, and Microsoft poured billions of dollars into AI. The pace of firings has barely diminished this year with more than 75,000 employees laid off worldwide, according to Layoffs.fyi, a tracker of tech layoffs started by a Bay Area entrepreneur. While companies point to various factors, such as post-pandemic restructuring and cost-cutting, they’re increasingly hesitant to mention AI.

Employees walk through Amazon's headquarters Nov. 13, 2018, in Seattle. Tech sector layoffs rose in 2023 as Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, and Microsoft poured billions of dollars into AI.

 Why? Companies may want to avoid public backlash for replacing people with machines, said Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, in a company press release in March. The Chicago-based outplacement firm started tracking AI-related layoffs last year and found 3,900 in a single month. By the first quarter of this year, that total had dwindled to 383 for all three months.

Job losses are only part of the problem. Workers may find new jobs, but if those positions pay substantially less, their standard of living falls. That’s what happened to many manufacturing workers in the 1980s and 1990s, displaced by robotics and a wave of globalization. It’s happening now for a new class of well-educated workers.Demand for skilled AI workersThose with high-level AI skills are in strong demand from companies eager to take advantage of the technology. “We’re hiring dozens,” says Robert Murphy, chief economist for Infineo, a tech company aiming to revolutionize life insurance through AI and blockchain technology. Some companies pay the most skilled workers $900,000 or more in salary and benefits. Three-quarters of knowledge workers say they already use AI on the job, nearly double the share of just six months ago, according to a Microsoft/LinkedIn survey of workers and employers in the United States and 30 other countries released Wednesday. “2024 is the year AI at work gets real.”Other well-educated workers have found themselves on the wrong side of the technology. After earning her Ph.D in art history in 2017, Allison Harbin became a researcher for academic journals. Once ChatGPT was released publicly in 2022, a fifth of her income dried up. She took a job doing “prompt engineering” – editing AI chatbots’ responses during their training. But the pay was low, and even with a new job, her income still isn’t stable.

“I’m not even going to put this on my résumé,” she says. “Old jobs are going to be eliminated,” says Dr. Brynjolfsson of Stanford. “There’s just a lot of creative destruction and churn. [However], the tools [of AI], when used correctly, will help rebuild the middle class and will help create more widely shared prosperity.”

The stage in an industrial building at Gateway Technical College, with a manufacturing space visible behind it, was decorated with American flags, a Microsoft banner and signs that read, “President Joe Biden Investing in America.”AdvertisementMany of the remarks seemed designed to troll Trump. Biden mocked Trump for repeatedly promising to address the nation’s aging infrastructure without actually doing so.“We had infrastructure week every week for four years and didn’t build a damn thing,” he said.The White House billed the appearance as part of Biden’s “Investing in America” strategy, seeking to draw a sharp contrast with his predecessor, who spent Tuesday posting angry messages on social media about his criminal trial for allegedly falsifying business records to conceal hush money payments to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels.Story continues below advertisementThe trip marks Biden’s fourth visit this year to the swing state of Wisconsin, where he narrowly defeated Trump in 2020.In 2018, when Foxconn, at Trump’s urging, announced plans to create 13,000 good-paying jobs in Mount Pleasant, Wis., he celebrated the company’s $10 billion venture as the “Eighth Wonder of the World.”AdvertisementWielding a golden shovel, Trump touted the Foxconn flat-panel display factory as evidence of a broad manufacturing revival stirred by his 2017 tax cuts and tariffs on imported steel. “You know, 18 months ago, this was a field, and now it’s one of the most advanced places of any kind you’ll see anywhere in the world. It’s incredible,” Trump crowed.Story continues below advertisementThe Foxconn facility was to have included dozens of buildings dotting a giant plot of land three times the size of New York’s Central Park. But the project accomplished little more than the destruction of 100 local homes and farms before the company drastically scaled back its ambitions.In 2020, Wisconsin state officials denied the Taiwanese company special tax credits, saying it had abandoned its original commitment, employed fewer than 520 people and spent just $300 million. Local taxpayers were left with a tab of more than $500 million for site preparation.AdvertisementBy last summer, Foxconn had built four structures on one corner of the site, which were in sporadic use, according to locals. One large building that was originally billed as a manufacturing facility was being used as a warehouse, one former employee said. Foxconn at the time said it employed 1,000 people in Mount Pleasant building computer servers. The flat-panel display factory never materialized.Story continues below advertisement“They dug a hole with those golden shovels and then they fell into it,” Biden quipped.Microsoft gave the site new life in March 2023, when local officials announced that the company would build a data center on about one-tenth of the roughly 3,000-acre campus. In November, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers (D) said Microsoft would expand the investment. Wednesday’s announcement confirms that the company plans to spend $3.3 billion on the AI center by the end of 2026, according to the governor’s office.AdvertisementFor Biden, the Microsoft announcement represents evidence that his embrace of industrial policy — the use of government money and dictates to shape the economy — is paying dividends. The president steered three major pieces of legislation through Congress that will pump trillions of dollars into modernizing the nation’s roads, bridges, ports and internet connections; subsidize development of clean-energy technologies; and fund domestic production of advanced semiconductors.Story continues below advertisementTaken together, the policies represented a dramatic shift in the government’s management of the economy after four decades of bipartisan deference to market outcomes.Smith said Biden’s policies had been important for corporate expansions.“When you connect the dots between the infrastructure investment, the chips investment, the climate technology investment, the work to set new AI safety standards and cybersecurity protection — you put those things together? That actually helps substantially in enabling the whole tech sector to invest and grow and create new jobs in the United States,” he said.AdvertisementPrivate companies so far have committed to spending $866 billion on ventures related to the administration’s agenda, according to the White House. More than $537 billion in public spending has been announced, with more to come.Story continues below advertisementThe administration is directing a significant chunk of its industrial policy spending to manufacturing-dependent communities that were hit hard by competition from inexpensive Chinese imports in the 2000s. By 2020, Racine had lost roughly 20 percent of the 21,000 factory jobs it had in 2001. Manufacturing employment has recovered to almost 19,000 today, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Wednesday’s announcement comes as Microsoft aggressively invests in expanding its footprint in AI development, pouring billions into deals that will cement its place as a key partner for leading AI companies in the United States, Europe and Asia.AdvertisementIn a community where residents have reason to doubt heavily hyped projects, Smith said Microsoft was being careful to “under-promise and overdeliver.”Story continues below advertisementWork on the Mount Pleasant site already has begun. Construction cranes are in place, steel has arrived, and some workers have been hired, he said.Amid concerns about the environmental toll of electricity-hungry data centers, Microsoft also said it would build a 250-megawatt solar project in Wisconsin. The company vowed to ensure water was “managed responsibly” at the site, which will use recycled water for its cooling system.Microsoft — which was battered by antitrust scrutiny throughout the 1990s — has emerged as one of the most sophisticated tech lobbyists in Washington, and it is increasingly seeking to shape the future of AI regulation.As part of its investment in Racine, Microsoft will partner with Gateway Technical College to develop a program that will train residents for data center and other technical careers. The company is also building a “Co-Innovation Lab” on the campus of the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, which will connect manufacturers in the state with the company’s AI experts.That undertaking will include TitletownTech, a venture capital partnership between Microsoft and the Green Bay Packers, Evers’s office said.

        Futuristic robots take over Automate 2024 AI conference, but tech experts warn of possible job losses

Watch: The cost of producing robots has reduced, while AI has advanced, and most of the technology is now available to use - leading to a possible robotics boom in the next few years  Credits: Newshub.







Automate 2024 is underway in the US, showcasing both the cutting-edge of robotics and why a sci-fi future could be a lot closer than most of us think.
But technology experts here say the rapid pace of development for robotics and AI (artificial intelligence) could lead to the collapse of some industries.
""We've seen years and years of innovation now starting to come to fruition, so the idea of humanoid robots and a range of other robots, will very quickly become mainstream,"" Gorilla Tech CEO Paul Spain told Newshub.  
""So very soon, we are just going to find robots around us as just normal, everyday life.""

While building advanced robots has been possible for decades, the AI boom of the past two years has unlocked a new frontier.
""[There are] three things that are different about robotics,"" Spain said.
""The cost of producing robots has come down dramatically; where we're at with AI, which really enables robotics, has changed; and basically we've actually reached the point where most of the technology is available - and it's really just joining up the dots and turning it on and starting using it,"" he added.
Intrinsic, an AI company owned by Google, is pairing up with the world's leading AI computer chip manufacturer - NVIDIA - for their next generation of machines.
However, experts here warn the pace of progress in both AI and robotics mean large-scale job disruption is inevitable and we need to start planning.















                Humanoid robots are quickly becoming more human-like.

""We in New Zealand need to start thinking about what sort of society we want to have where we have these very capable machines,"" warns Professor Michael Witbrock, head of the Strong Artificial Intelligence Lab at the University of Auckland Waipapa Taumata Rau. 
""We've never had a technology before that has the potential to do, well, practically everything, right?"" Prof Witbrock told Newshub.



""That's just true about the combination of AI and robotics and there may be missteps, there may be slow downs. But there are no obvious reasons why we're not on a path to very general capabilities at the moment."" 
Automate 2024 runs until Thursday in Chicago.
