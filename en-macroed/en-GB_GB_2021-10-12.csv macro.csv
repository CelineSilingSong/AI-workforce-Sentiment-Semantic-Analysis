Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  Founded in 1977 by a team of engineers led by Larry Ellison, Oracle became the world’s largest database management company by 1987. Today, Oracle claims a long list of innovations including: The world’s only autonomous database More than 18,500 patents worldwide Over 40,000 engineers and developers 469 independent user communities in 97 countries As of 2021, Oracle trades on the NYSE with a market cap that exceeds $235 billion. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, Oracle reported revenues exceeding $40.4 billion, according to its Fiscal Year 2021 10-K filing. Oracle claims to have committed itself to AI and its future. “By 2027,” Oracle predicts, “75% of today’s S&P companies will be replaced by companies that take advantage of the new tools, new techniques, and new insights of artificial intelligence.”  In this article, we’ll look at how Oracle has explored the applications of AI for its business through two unique applications of AI technology: Bringing Speed and Efficiency to the Financial Close — Oracle uses both integration and AI to speed up the financial close and automate time-consuming manual tasks.  Human Capital Management: Sourcing Talent — Oracle uses AI-enhanced Human Capital Management to reduce time-to-hire and improve the quality of candidate pipelines. We will begin by examining how Oracle has made the financial close process an area of focus for the AI innovations it claims to have created to help Corporate Finance groups save both time and resources in executing this recurring duty.  Bringing Speed and Efficiency to the Financial Close  Before accounting departments can close the books for a certain period, they must perform a set of sequential steps to ensure that the company’s financial records represent its true financial position. Spanning an average of 4.8 to 10 days every month, according to APQC data reported in CFO Magazine, the financial close represents a significant cost to companies in terms of time, resources, and opportunity costs.  Oracle set out to discover what would happen by automating its financial close process with its integrated, cloud-based Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution with built-in artificial intelligence. The Oracle video below claims to show how the company has combined AI, machine learning, real-time analytics, machine-driven forecasts, collaboration, and augmented reality to create the solutions that will drive tomorrow’s finance and operations teams.   Says Maria Smith, an Oracle SVP and Corporate Controller: “The reality is that everything in Oracle is integrated. We have our sub-ledgers integrated, all our other systems like HCM [Human Capital Management], Supply Chain all integrated. We have one data set.” According to Oracle, that integration, coupled with the introduction of artificial intelligence gives users four competitive advantages: Comprehensive and objective predictive planning and forecasting through machine learning  Efficient AI-enabled automation of manual, time-consuming tasks A Natural Language Processing-powered digital assistant that allows users to simplify, speed, and monitor tasks Machine learning insights to drive the creation, implementation, and monitoring of new business models and strategies  By bringing AI to the financial close process, Oracle claims that users can explore larger datasets in less time and waste fewer resources on mundane, repetitive tasks. Those time and resource savings could be used to allow employees in corporate finance teams and beyond to focus more on the strategic outputs of their jobs.  Oracle hopes that bringing AI automation to up to 96% of transactions will result in much less time lost in the monthly race to move from the trial balance to the signing off of consolidated financials.   But, does it work? Through implementing its one-day financial close, Oracle claims to have already realized significant benefits, including: 42% reduction in manual accounting 94% of bank transactions now auto-reconciled 75% of account reconciliations fully automated  99% reduction in the prep time of global PO accruals  Human Capital Management: Sourcing Talent Up to seven weeks can pass before a successful candidate receives a job offer, according to research published by LinkedIn in August 2021. The social networking site analyzed the data of more than 400,000 confirmed hires on its platform and ranked, across 15 professions, the time that elapses between applying for a job and being hired. Engineers take the longest time (49 calendar days), administrative personnel the least (33 calendar days).  With US Labor Department data showing job openings growing and remaining unfilled, how do companies, hiring managers, and human resource partners reduce time-to-hire and improve the quality of their candidate pipelines?  To confront this societal problem exacerbated by the pandemic, Oracle offers its Best Candidates tool, one of its AI Apps for Human Capital Management (HCM). The solution, Oracle claims, delivers its value through AI and machine learning algorithms that optimize the candidate selection process by identifying and stack-ranking the candidates that best suit a job requisition.  According to Oracle, the HCM solution integrates information from the following sources:  Applicant data Candidate data Employee data Job requisition data Hiring stage-level decisions User feedback to prior candidate recommendations Below, Gretchen Alarcon, Oracle’s GVP of Product Strategy, discusses how machine learning and AI help Oracle HCM users identify top candidates from a pool of applicants to an open job requisition.  In its Help Center documentation, Oracle claims the natural language processing engine of the Best Candidates tool analyzes the frequency with which words and phrases appear in resumes and job descriptions and then considers the relevancy and context of those findings. The tool then creates mathematical constructs that compare the sources of data to find the best candidate matches for an open job. By using job requisitions and anonymized résumé data of candidate profiles within the Oracle Human Resources Cloud, Oracle claims that its Best Candidates tool optimizes the effectiveness and efficiency of hiring managers and recruiters and removes bias from candidate listings. Oracle claims that its Best Candidates tool reduces its customers’ time- and cost-to-hire through the automation of complex tasks like the review of resumes and profiles and matching candidate skills to job requirements.  Oracle does not appear to disclose the time-to-hire efficiencies that its customers may have experienced following the implementation of the Best Candidates tool. However, Oracle does state that the tool “increases recruiters’ productivity, helps reduce the time in the overall candidate selection process, and improves the quality of selected candidates” through its use of AI and machine learning technologies.  Related Posts Artificial Intelligence at Goldman Sachs - Current InitiativesThe top 100 global banks, including Goldman Sachs, are beginning to take AI strategies very… Artificial Intelligence at Morgan Stanley - Current InitiativesMorgan Stanley is a US financial institution known mostly for its financial advisory services.

A group of international researchers and the artificial intelligence developers at Exscientia have shown that an AI approach to personalized medicine could boost treatment success in patients with aggressive blood cancers.The method follows a basic idea: Take a test to see whether a drug will work before it’s given. But AI allowed clinicians to greatly scale up their efforts—by putting each patient’s cancer up against 139 different treatments—while increasing their precision in picking which medicines would be successful, which wouldn't, and which could become toxic.The researchers describe the trial as one of the first successful demonstrations of pharmacoscopy, a technique that relies on high-resolution, before-and-after images of patient samples to determine each drug’s effect on single cells, both malignant and not. The tool goes a step beyond the use of genetic biomarkers in precision medicine—which can only determine whether a particular target is present—by visually confirming a patient’s treatment options based on the sensitivity of cancer cells themselves. And all of that within a short time window, Exscientia’s VP of translational research, Gregory Vladimer, said in a release.“Precision medicine is the right drug, for the right patient, at the right time. By enabling the robust and accurate assessment of drug effect on viable patient samples at single-cell resolution, we have created a technology that can provide hemato-oncologists prediction of a patient’s response prior to deciding on a course of therapy,” said Vladimer, who helped co-invent the technology while working at the CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine at the Austrian Academy of Sciences.RELATED: Bristol Myers' $1.2B discovery pact with Exscientia strikes gold as first drug candidate selected Published in the journal Cancer Discovery, the study showed that more than half of 56 participants treated with the AI program’s recommendations saw significant increases in progression-free survival after nearly two years of follow-up, with 12 of those patients seeing drug responses that lasted three times longer than typically expected for their blood-based cancers. In addition, 13 patients went progression-free for at least 12 months, compared with only three who saw the same on treatments they had received before entering the study.“The results of the trial are clear: Patients who were treated using recommendations guided by single-cell drug screenings from real-time biopsies remained progression-free longer as compared to their previous line of therapy,” said principal investigator Philipp Staber, a hematologist-oncologist at Medical University Vienna.RELATED: SoftBank leads funding that could net up to $525M for Exscientia's AI drug platform

Earlier this month, the Oxford, U.K.-based Exscientia went public with a $350 million IPO on the Nasdaq, alongside an additional $160 million raised from a private placement of shares. Those proceeds followed on a major series D funding round earlier this year, which raised at least $225 million, and included an option for $300 million more from SoftBank Vision Fund 2. The company also uses its computing platforms to develop new molecules, with a pipeline spearheaded by three AI-designed candidates that have begun phase 1 clinical trials—including one immuno-oncology agent for solid tumors in partnership with Evotec, and two psychiatry-focused assets co-developed with Sumitomo Dainippon.Editor's note: This story has been corrected with Exscientia's full IPO amount.

SourceAI is an algorithm that allows the user to ‘ask’ it to write code for performing a task. The user chooses a programming language, like Python or SQL and hits Translate. Just like translating a sentence from English to Spanish, SourceAI translates the request into code. Of course the implications of something like this can be enormous which begs the question; Are we coding ourselves out of a job?Source: https://sourceai.dev/Big Data JobsIt seems like A.I. automation has penetrated almost every level of our economic sector. While automation in manufacturing is nothing new, we have been implementing some version of it since the earliest assembly lines, the potential shift in scale that artificial intelligence can usher is tremendous. Companies are not only moving towards automated manufacturing but to automating the entire research and development process. Google is using machine learning algorithms to design it’s microchips and is finding the design to be as good or better than the design of a human engineer.One of the most important elements of building advanced microchips is maximizing the use of the chip’s entire surface area. The more we can cram into every nanometer of space, the more powerful the chip will be. It’s not surprising that machine learning is excellent at creating complex patterns, after all that is the biggest advantage of a neural network. But does that mean that the engineers will lose work? Absolutely not! Machines perform very well at repetitive tasks but innovation is still squarely in the domain of the human mind.Trending AI Articles:1. Why Corporate AI projects fail?2. How AI Will Power the Next Wave of Healthcare Innovation?3. Machine Learning by Using Regression Model4. Top Data Science Platforms in 2021 Other than KaggleEven though A.I. development has come a long way, machines still do not have the same capacity for adaptation as people. Finding geometric patterns may be playing to an A.I. ‘s strength but an engineer has to figure out the applications of the microchips which requires understanding of the market far more complex than finding tight patterns on a surface.Source:https://www.shaip.com/blog/the-only-guide-on-ai-training-data-you-will-need-in-2021/An A.I. has to be trained on data in order to perform its task. The SourceAI project was built on GPT-3, a neural network trained Natural Language Processor built by OpenAI. While its original intention was to summarize documents by grasping their concept, if not their meaning, data scientists realized that it was also able to read and distinguish code. The SourceAI project was conceived and created because the humans who were interpreting the results were able to intuit this unintended pattern and subsequently adapt the code to create something new.I would argue that the answer to the original question is an emphatic no. As data scientists our job is not only to create these A.I. machines. We have to train them on the correct data relating to the problem at hand and be able to interpret the results in a meaningful, intuitive, and creative way. Those are qualities that no A.I. built so far has come even close to matching, let alone surpassing humanity. We have plenty of work left to do.Don’t forget to give us your 👏 !",,https://becominghuman.ai/automating-a-i-3e3366ffd368,Automating A.I. - Becoming Human: Artificial Intelligence Magazine,,2021-10-15T17:22:12.342Z,,,,,,,,,,,,3e3366ffd368,['Dimitry Belozersky'],,,,,,,,,,,

DURHAM, NC -- Whether preventing explosions on electrical grids, spotting patterns among past crimes, or optimizing resources in the care of critically ill patients, Duke University computer scientist Cynthia Rudin wants artificial intelligence (AI) to show its work. Especially when it’s making decisions that deeply affect people’s lives.
While many scholars in the developing field of machine learning were focused on improving algorithms, Rudin instead wanted to use AI’s power to help society. She chose to pursue opportunities to apply machine learning techniques to important societal problems, and in the process, realized that AI’s potential is best unlocked when humans can peer inside and understand what it is doing.
Now, after 15 years of advocating for and developing “interpretable” machine learning algorithms that allow humans to see inside AI, Rudin’s contributions to the field have earned her the $1 million Squirrel AI Award for Artificial Intelligence for the Benefit of Humanity from the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI). Founded in 1979, AAAI serves as the prominent international scientific society serving AI researchers, practitioners and educators.
Rudin, a professor of computer science and engineering at Duke, is the second recipient of the new annual award, funded by the online education company Squirrel AI to recognize achievements in artificial intelligence in a manner comparable to top prizes in more traditional fields.
She is being cited for “pioneering scientific work in the area of interpretable and transparent AI systems in real-world deployments, the advocacy for these features in highly sensitive areas such as social justice and medical diagnosis, and serving as a role model for researchers and practitioners.”
“Only world-renowned recognitions, such as the Nobel Prize and the A.M. Turing Award from the Association of Computing Machinery, carry monetary rewards at the million-dollar level,” said AAAI awards committee chair and past president Yolanda Gil. “Professor Rudin's work highlights the importance of transparency for AI systems in high-risk domains.  Her courage in tackling controversial issues calls out the importance of research to address critical challenges in responsible and ethical use of AI.""
Rudin’s first applied project was a collaboration with Con Edison, the energy company responsible for powering New York City. Her assignment was to use machine learning to predict which manholes were at risk of exploding due to degrading and overloaded electrical circuitry. But she soon discovered that no matter how many newly published academic bells and whistles she added to her code, it struggled to meaningfully improve performance when confronted by the challenges posed by working with handwritten notes from dispatchers and accounting records from the time of Thomas Edison.
“We were getting more accuracy from simple classical statistics techniques and a better understanding of the data as we continued to work with it,” Rudin said. “If we could understand what information the predictive models were using, we could ask the Con Edison engineers for useful feedback that improved our whole process. It was the interpretability in the process that helped improve accuracy in our predictions, not any bigger or fancier machine learning model. That’s what I decided to work on, and it is the foundation upon which my lab is built.”
Over the next decade, Rudin developed techniques for interpretable machine learning, which are predictive models that explain themselves in ways that humans can understand. While the code for designing these formulas is complex and sophisticated, the formulas might be small enough to be written in a few lines on an index card.
Rudin has applied her brand of interpretable machine learning to numerous impactful projects. With collaborators Brandon Westover and Aaron Struck at Massachusetts General Hospital, and her former student Berk Ustun, she designed a simple point-based system that can predict which patients are most at risk of having destructive seizures after a stroke or other brain injury. And with her former MIT student Tong Wang and the Cambridge Police Department, she developed a model that helps discover commonalities between crimes to determine whether they might be part of a series committed by the same criminals. That open-source program eventually became the basis of the New York Police Department’s Patternizr algorithm, a powerful piece of code that determines whether a new crime committed in the city is related to past crimes.
“Cynthia’s commitment to solving important real-world problems, desire to work closely with domain experts, and ability to distill and explain complex models is unparalleled,” said Daniel Wagner, deputy superintendent of the Cambridge Police Department. “Her research resulted in significant contributions to the field of crime analysis and policing. More impressively, she is a strong critic of potentially unjust ‘black box’ models in criminal justice and other high-stakes fields, and an intense advocate for transparent interpretable models where accurate, just and bias-free results are essential.”
Black box models are the opposite of Rudin’s transparent codes. The methods applied in these AI algorithms make it impossible for humans to understand what factors the models depend on, which data the models are focusing on and how they’re using it. While this may not be a problem for trivial tasks such as distinguishing a dog from a cat, it could be a huge problem for high-stakes decisions that change people’s lives.
“Cynthia is changing the landscape of how AI is used in societal applications by redirecting efforts away from black box models and toward interpretable models by showing that the conventional wisdom—that black boxes are typically more accurate—is very often false,” said Jun Yang, chair of the computer science department at Duke. “This makes it harder to justify subjecting individuals (such as defendants) to black-box models in high-stakes situations. The interpretability of Cynthia's models has been crucial in getting them adopted in practice, since they enable human decision-makers, rather than replace them.”
One impactful example involves COMPAS—an AI algorithm used across multiple states to make bail parole decisions that was accused by a ProPublica investigation of partially using race as a factor in its calculations. The accusation is difficult to prove, however, as the details of the algorithm are proprietary information, and some important aspects of the analysis by ProPublica are questionable. Rudin's team has demonstrated that a simple interpretable model that reveals exactly which factors it’s taking into consideration is just as good at predicting whether or not a person will commit another crime. This begs the question, Rudin says, as to why black box models need to be used at all for these types of high-stakes decisions.
""We've been systematically showing that for high-stakes applications, there's no loss in accuracy to gain interpretability, as long as we optimize our models carefully,” Rudin said. “We've seen this for criminal justice decisions, numerous healthcare decisions including medical imaging, power grid maintenance decisions, financial loan decisions and more. Knowing that this is possible changes the way we think about AI as incapable of explaining itself.""
Throughout her career, Rudin has not only been creating these interpretable AI models, but developing and publishing techniques to help others do the same. That hasn’t always been easy. When she first began publishing her work, the terms “data science” and ""interpretable machine learning"" did not exist, and there were no categories into which her research fit neatly, which means that editors and reviewers didn't know what to do with it. Cynthia found that if a paper wasn’t proving theorems and claiming its algorithms to be more accurate, it was—and often still is—more difficult to publish.
As Rudin continues to help people and publish her interpretable designs—and as more concerns continue to crop up with black box code—her influence is finally beginning to turn the ship. There are now entire categories in machine learning journals and conferences devoted to interpretable and applied work. Other colleagues in the field and their collaborators are vocalizing how important interpretability is for designing trustworthy AI systems.
“I have had enormous admiration for Cynthia from very early on, for her spirit of independence, her determination, and her relentless pursuit of true understanding of anything new she encountered in classes and papers,” said Ingrid Daubechies, the James B. Duke Distinguished Professor of Mathematics and Electrical and Computer Engineering, one of the world’s preeminent researchers in signal processing, and one of Rudin’s PhD advisors at Princeton University. “Even as a graduate student, she was a community builder, standing up for others in her cohort. She got me into machine learning, as it was not an area in which I had any expertise at all before she gently but very persistently nudged me into it. I am so very glad for this wonderful and very deserved recognition for her!”
“I could not be more thrilled to see Cynthia’s work honored in this way,” added Rudin’s second PhD advisor, Microsoft Research partner Robert Schapire, whose work on “boosting” helped lay the foundations for modern machine learning. “For her inspiring and insightful research, her independent thinking that has led her in directions very different from the mainstream, and for her longstanding attention to issues and problems of practical, societal importance.”
Rudin earned undergraduate degrees in mathematical physics and music theory from the University at Buffalo before completing her PhD in applied and computational mathematics at Princeton. She then worked as a National Science Foundation postdoctoral research fellow at New York University, and as an associate research scientist at Columbia University. She became an associate professor of statistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before joining Duke’s faculty in 2017, where she holds appointments in computer science, electrical and computer engineering, biostatistics and bioinformatics, and statistical science.
She is a three-time recipient of the INFORMS Innovative Applications in Analytics Award, which recognizes creative and unique applications of analytical techniques, and is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association and the Institute of Mathematical Statistics.
“I want to thank AAAI and Squirrel AI for creating this award that I know will be a game-changer for the field,” Rudin said. “To have a ‘Nobel Prize’ for AI to help society makes it finally clear without a doubt that this topic—AI work for the benefit for society—is actually important.”

Top Employers, States Hiring Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) Talent

Which companies are hiring artificial intelligence (A.I.) and machine learning experts? As you might expect, the need for A.I. talent extends beyond the technology sector to industries as varied as insurance, finance, and healthcare.  
In September, the top companies soliciting A.I. and machine-learning talent included Microsoft, Deloitte, Travelers, Amazon, and others. (This data comes from CompTIA, which ran its analysis via Emsi Burning Glass, which collects and analyzes millions of job postings from across the country.)    
  
These huge companies have the budget and resources to hire A.I. talent, which is often quite expensive. In addition to sourcing technologists, any organization interested in A.I. and machine learning must also pay for the tools and other infrastructure needed to put a robust A.I. operation in place. That takes money and time, but the eventual rewards could prove worth it, especially if A.I. can streamline operations or generate useful insights from corporate databases.  
However, artificial intelligence is a bit more diverse when it comes to geography, with hiring taking place in multiple states last month, as you can see from the chart below:   
  
How much do A.I.-related jobs actually pay? O’Reilly estimates the average salary of data and A.I. professionals at $146,000 per year (that’s from 2,778 respondents in the U.S. and 284 in the U.K.), with increases averaging 2.25 percent per year. Average compensation was highest in California ($176,000). And at some point, there’s every possibility that artificial intelligence jobs will become more mainstream— according to Emsi Burning Glass, jobs that heavily involve machine learning are predicted to grow 76.3 percent over the next 10 years.

It sounds like ominous sci-fi dystopia, but it is what awaits the majority of employees in this eventful first third of the 21st century: to be hired and fired by machines, without human intermediation. It is possible that many of these workers will go through this cycle of creative destruction several times during their careers, which are forecast to be turbulent. It is the end of the idea of a job for life that was commonplace until the end of the 20th century.Last August, Xsolla, the Russian subsidiary of a software and interactive services company headquartered in Los Angeles, carried out an avant-garde workplace restructuring that caught global media attention. Without prior warning, Xsolla decided to fire 150 of its 450 employees at its offices in Perm, based solely on the verdict of a performance-related algorithm that considered the workers “unengaged and unproductive.”It was the work of neither the coronavirus pandemic nor the oft-leaned upon “structural review.” On this occasion, the reason given to justify a mass redundancy was the cold calculation of an artificial intelligence program fed by “big data.”Xsolla is one of many examples of a modern and disruptive company employing artificial intelligence in its decision-making processes. What is genuinely novel is that the functions the machine has taken on in this instance are nothing less than those of the CEO and the human resources and talent management departments.In the film ‘Modern Times’ (1936), Charles Chaplin warned about the dangers of machines in the workplace.Getty ImagesThat machines would one day replace human workers is something that the 19th-century English Luddites were convinced of and that Charlie Chaplin laid out so eloquently in his 1936 movie Modern Times. What nobody expected was that machines would become our bosses.There is one striking precedent: Amazon, the mother of all disruptive companies, caught the attention of Bloomberg due to its proclivity for firing people based on IT criteria. One of the fired workers, Stephen Normandin, was interviewed earlier this year and the headlines turned him into an emblem of this apparently cold and dehumanized process.Normandin, a 63-year-old US Army veteran from Phoenix, Arizona, had been working as a delivery driver for Jeff Bezos’ company for four years when he received an email informing him, with no sugar-coating, that his contract had been terminated. The algorithm tracking his daily activity had considered him unfit for the job. He had been fired by a machine.In the Bloomberg interview, Normandin describes himself as “an old-school kind of guy,” who gives every job “110%.” He took the loss of his job as a personal affront and said it was not justified. Nobody spoke to him to explain the criteria that led the artificial intelligence to question his commitment and competence. “I’ve worked 12-hour shifts in a community diner for Vietnamese refugees in Arkansas,” he said. “I’ve proven on multiple occasions that I am a disciplined and responsible person. I do not deserve to be fired without someone listening to me, taking into account my circumstances or providing an explanation.” In his view, he was fired due to his age, without his enthusiasm for work or his excellent physical and mental health being taken into account, but his attempts to prove this to Amazon though arbitration proved fruitless.Spencer Soper, who wrote the Bloomberg article, says that Normandin against the machine is a “losing battle” and the result of a “sinister misunderstanding.”“Men like him continue to believe in the culture of hard work and dignity of employment, while companies like Amazon base their model on the increasing automation of production processes and labor routines that almost completely exclude the human factor,” Soper says.Amazon and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos.JIM WATSON (AFP)In an interview with CNBC, Bezos stated his belief that the only business decisions that it is essential to leave in the hands of human beings are “strategic ones.” Everything else, the “day-today” decisions, however important they may be, he prefers to leave to artificial intelligence algorithms because they act “taking into account all of the relevant information without emotional interference.” For the Amazon CEO, “artificial intelligence optimizes processes and, in the medium and long term, will create many more jobs than it destroys.” Unfortunate cases from a human perspective, like that of Normandin, are no more than collateral damage in a revolution that is advancing inexorably.For Fabián Nevado, a labor law expert at the Catalonia Syndicate of Journalists, “it is disgraceful from a moral point of view that you can be fired by an algorithm applying general criteria that do not take into account personal circumstances and, above all, with no human being bothering to communicate in person with a minimum of respect and empathy.”Nevertheless, Nevado does not believe that these kinds of events are only likely to take place in poorly regulated labor markets, such as those in Russia or the United States. “On the contrary, in Spain, despite what people believe, dismissal is free. What happens is that the reasons for the dismissal have to be put forward and if there is no agreement, a judge will end up deciding if the reasons given are convincing or not.” But it is perfectly legal for companies to use artificial intelligence to monitor the performance of their employees as long as it is carried out within the framework of the Personal Data Law. “In any case,” says Nevado, “the person doing the firing will always be an employer, a human being or a group of them. But the machine could be the tool used to justify the dismissal. In fact, this is already happening in many cases.”If all else fails, a judge will rule on the matter, a little like the recommendations of the VAR system in professional soccer, that controversial tool that was supposed to revolutionize sporting justice. What is not acceptable under any circumstances, says Nevado, “is that neither the bosses nor the human resources departments take on responsibility for the dismissal, hiding behind algorithms and other technological innovations to pass the buck and further dehumanize labor relations.” If the trend continues, Nevado predicts a “very dark future” for human resources departments.These could disappear entirely if the idea of leaving the management of talent (contracts, hiring and firing, pay rises, disciplinary processes, bonuses, etc) fully in the hands of machines crystallizes. “And not just human resources departments,” he adds. “Many management positions will also be in jeopardy, above all those whose salaries depend on the ability to monitor the workers under their charge.” In a world of innovative entrepreneurs, cutting-edge management technology and an interchangeable workforce, the foreman will be unnecessary.Frank Pasquale, a professor at New York’s Brooklyn Law School, addresses these issues in his book New Laws of Robotics. In the view of this intellectual, who defines himself as a “humanist with technological competence,” artificial intelligence should never replace the experience and capacity for human reasoning in “areas that have clear ethical implications.” That is to say, a machine should never be permitted to decide who gets shot, who gets run over or who gets fired, because it would do so based purely on criteria of efficiency. Decisions like these cannot be automated and cannot be disassociated from a process of “responsible reflection,” a uniquely human tool. For Pasquale, the “digital boss” will always be a tyrant because it dehumanizes people by treating them like they are not people, “by converting them into mere tools and denying them their status as free and rational creatures.”The safety net against using algorithms to fire employees, says Spain’s labor union UGT in a working document titled Algorithmic relations in labor relations, has to take the form of a clear regulation that demands transparency over what criteria the artificial intelligence uses. “The principle of precaution has to be applied,” says UGT head of digitalization José Varela. Because algorithms, like any product of human intelligence, can make mistakes. Furthermore, they do not concern themselves over whether their decisions could have a negative impact on “the security of people or their basic rights.” In other words, if we are going to get fired by an algorithm, we must demand first of all that it knows what it is doing.English version by Rob Train.Tu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo¿Quieres añadir otro usuario a tu suscripción?Añadir usuarioContinuar leyendo aquíSi continúas leyendo en este dispositivo, no se podrá leer en el otro.¿Por qué estás viendo esto?Flecha Tu suscripción se está usando en otro dispositivo y solo puedes acceder a EL PAÍS desde un dispositivo a la vez.

In the view of this intellectual, who defines himself as a “humanist with technological competence,” artificial intelligence should never replace the experience and capacity for human reasoning in “areas that have clear ethical implications.” That is to say, a machine should never be permitted to decide who gets shot, who gets run over or who gets fired, because it would do so based purely on criteria of efficiency. Decisions like these cannot be automated and cannot be disassociated from a process of “responsible reflection,” a uniquely human tool. For Pasquale, the “digital boss” will always be a tyrant because it dehumanizes people by treating them like they are not people, “by converting them into mere tools and denying them their status as free and rational creatures.” The safety net against using algorithms to fire employees, says Spain’s labor union UGT in a working document titled Algorithmic relations in labor relations, has to take the form of a clear regulation that demands transparency over what criteria the artificial intelligence uses. “The principle of precaution has to be applied,” says UGT head of digitalization José Varela. Because algorithms, like any product of human intelligence, can make mistakes. Furthermore, they do not concern themselves over whether their decisions could have a negative impact on “the security of people or their basic rights.” In other words, if we are going to get fired by an algorithm, we must demand first of all that it knows what it is doing.",U.S.,en,"{'@type': 'Place', 'name': 'Barcelona'}","{'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'url': 'https://elpais.com/estaticos/code-of-ethics/'}",https://elpais.com/estaticos/terms-and-conditions/,"{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'cssSelector': 'h1.a_t'}",,,

In an artificial intelligence interview, there are a few things to keep in mind. In this article, we will mention the 5 do's and 5 don'ts of an artificial intelligence interview..5 Do's of an AI Interview.Match your talents to the job description.After you've determined and narrowed down the job role you want to apply for, match your abilities to the job description to see whether it matches the requirements. Demonstrate to the interviewer that you are eager to learn. If you can persuade them that you are prepared to work hard and develop abilities that you do not now possess, there is a good chance they will be impressed and hire you..Become an expert in the field of artificial intelligence.To ace the interview and land a job, you'll need to brush up on your AI abilities. Neural networks, analytical thinking, deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), cost-effective problem-solving capability, ability to translate technical data into an understandable format, ability to design software programs, and a knack for foreseeing technological innovations that can help the business are just a few of the skills required. You should be comfortable with programming languages like Java, Python, R, and Prolog..Discuss the company.Your understanding of the organization with which you're interviewing demonstrates your interest in working there and how well-informed you are about current events. So, do your homework on the company, show them why you'll be a valuable addition, explain why you picked artificial intelligence as a profession, reveal any specific AI software you want to create, and demonstrate that you're receptive to criticism. All of these factors will improve your chances of landing a job..Work experience and approach to problem-solving.Choose one or two significant projects from your prior work and explain your approach to them: how your strategy contributed to the solution, what were your main accomplishments, the leadership qualities you demonstrated, and so forth. Critical thinking ability, how you apply your knowledge to data use cases, why your method or technique works, speed and accuracy in addressing a problem, ability to develop a demo code, and the capacity to change any given code are all qualities that your interviewers are looking for..Determine the best AI employment role for you.AI is a broad field with a variety of employment opportunities. Software analysts and developers, computer scientists, computer engineers, algorithm experts, and electrical engineers are all occupations that are connected to artificial intelligence. Additionally, decide on the domain in which you'd like to pursue an AI profession..5 Don'ts of an AI Interview.For a resume, don't put too much emphasis on technical skills.When it comes to including technical talents on a CV, don't think of it as a brag. Don't forget to bring all of your AI certifications with you to the interview since they will assist the interviewer to customize the questions to you. In the end, the more you have, the better, because it shows how excited you are about your AI career..Don't be afraid to elaborate.Perhaps you are not like the majority of AI experts. You should be aware that the majority of persons in this field do not have the same level of communication skills as those in the artificial intelligence area. This may be due to the mathematical mind, but it doesn't matter. As a result, your prospects of landing the job may be harmed. It may be seen in how people reply to queries with simple yes and no. &quot;Do you have prior experience dealing with AI technology?&quot; is not a yes or no question, for example. If you do, you must explain how you found out about it, where you've used it, and what you like and hate about it. If not, you should explain whatever similar technology you tried and how you got on with it. Don't be stingy with your explanations..Do not deceive yourself.AI job interviewers have a difficult task ahead of them. They must determine whether a job seeker is qualified for a position in a short amount of time. Interviewers benefit from honesty and inquisitiveness. This is why lying in an AI interview is not a good idea. Instead, if you've asked a question, you don't know the answer to, ask the interviewers to expand so you can be sure you have no idea what the answer is. Admit that you have no idea and ask if they would be prepared to throw some light on the situation..Don't answer &quot;Do You Have Any Questions?&quot; With a no.Your interest in the company you want to work for is one of the most essential things to demonstrate during the AI interview. During the interview, there are many possibilities to communicate this, although they are frequently subtle. This is why you should go after the one genuine chance. &quot;Do you have any questions?&quot; says the narrator. This is an excellent opportunity for you to demonstrate to the interviewer that you are enthusiastic about the position. Inquire about their firm, their rivals, and their approach for dealing with certain challenges, among other things. You get the picture. This indicates that you have prepared for the interview, that you have examined the company's history, and that you are concerned about the company's success..Never make a negative comment about your prior employment.Avoid sabotaging your interview by mentioning how much you disliked your prior workplace. Instead, use that time to focus on the good aspects of the situation. Even if it's about unpleasant events like layoffs, you should talk about your learnings and progress since attitude is everything, and having a positive attitude is crucial. You may be completely truthful, but the impression you'll give the interviewer is that things didn't work out well for you at the prior organization because you were under-performing and that if they employ you, you'll say the same thing about them eventually..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

When it comes to oil spills, experts should turn to artificial intelligence
UBCO researcher says machines can calculate a fix quicker than people
October 13, 2021

UBC Okanagan researcher Saeed Mohammadiun’s work involves reviewing marine oil spill management including how computational techniques based on real-time data can be applied to an effective oil spill response.
The eyes of the world turned to a California beach recently as an underwater pipeline ruptured, leaking more than 550,000 litres of oil into the waters off the coast.
A large oil spill is one of the worst nightmares for environmentalists and local people living in an affected area, says UBC Okanagan researcher Saeed Mohammadiun. His work at UBC Okanagan’s Life Cycle Management Lab involves reviewing marine oil spill management. The School of Engineering doctoral student examined a decade of past management responses to oil spills. His most recent research looks at computational techniques based on real-time data and how they can be applied to an effective oil spill response.
What are some of the key takeaways from your latest paper when considering the recent marine oil spill in California?
Oil spills are tragic events and may have catastrophic environmental, human health, and socio-economic consequences; in California, local authorities are calling it an “environmental catastrophe.”
Even small-scale incidents may concern stakeholders, such as the recent incident in Bella Bella, BC, which has greatly affected the socio-economic status of the local indigenous community. The spilled oil may cause drastic consequences for local economies such as tourism and fisheries.
One essential step to minimize consequences of oil spills is to enhance the response preparedness by employing advanced scientific techniques such as remote sensing and data mining. Intelligent computational techniques can be used along with advanced detection and monitoring methods, such as remote sensing, to facilitate an effective and timely oil spill response. We have critically reviewed recent articles in this field and suggested a holistic framework for effective management of oil spills.
How does marine oil spill management (MOSM) minimize the impacts of oil spills?
MOSM can broadly cover multiple components such as oil spill detection and monitoring, risk assessment, response method selection and process optimization, and waste management.
An effective MOSM, based on appropriate computational-technique-based tools, can consider both proactive and reactive practices for oil spill prevention and also mitigate adverse impacts of an oil spill if it happens.
The three major benefits of an effective MOSM are the ability to detect oil spills in a timely manner, conduct the most appropriate oil spill response and reduce amounts of oily waste generated from response operations. An effective MOSM ultimately leads to minimizing the impacts of spilled oil.
Describe the role of robust computation techniques based on real-time data in reducing oil spill impacts
One important component of MOSM is the response operation, which aims to contain and clean up the spilled oil and contaminated area before any significant adverse environmental and economic impacts can occur. Response to an oil spill is a time-sensitive and complex task that is significantly reliant on available data, resources and decisions made.
Another significant challenge is the fact that collected oily wastes can be up to 10 times more than the original oil spill volume. Oily waste management is usually the bottleneck of all clean-up operations due to limitations in local resources including storage infrastructure and transportation facilities.
Inappropriate management of generated oily waste may exacerbate the situation because of secondary contamination. The application of intelligent computational techniques is essential to help stakeholders make timely and suitable decisions based on limited data. A real-time computational-based tool should be able to systematically find the most appropriate management practices by taking a considerable number of influential factors into account.
You reviewed similar research for the past 10 years. What reoccurring themes did you discover?
The risk of oil spills has increased by growing marine oil exploration and transportation activities. This trend can also be seen in arctic and sub-arctic waters under the effect of climate change, such as the Canadian Arctic, which has seen a significant increase in ship traffic and oil exploration activities in recent years. It is estimated that about two million tons of oil enter the marine environment every year around the world.
Application of artificial intelligence and soft computing techniques in oil spill management has been a new trend in this research area due to better data availability and advancement in computational techniques. Better meteorological and oceanic data, better satellite image access, advances in oil spill trajectory simulators as well as progress in artificial intelligence and soft computing techniques have collectively increased the number of studies in this field. There is still a dire need for better real-world oil spill data to enhance the performance of intelligent decision-making tools.
What role can artificial intelligence and machine learning play in minimizing the impacts of oil spills or improve oil spill response?
Both can play an important role concerning various components of oil spill management—from timely detection in remote areas to optimal response selection and waste management. An appropriate oil spill management strategy should be determined based on a significant number of factors, such as the dynamic characteristics of spilled oil and environmental conditions. Remote sensing methods can be integrated with artificial intelligence techniques, analyzing features of images, to accurately detect and monitor oil spills in offshore and onshore regions.
After the detection, it is usually necessary to respond to an oil spill immediately. To this end, artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques can considerably facilitate the decision-making process by analyzing previous oil spill data and subtle patterns that are often hidden in the data.
These intelligent tools facilitate the instant selection of the most suitable response method and its operational process.
In other words, machine learning can use previous oil spills to help manage future incidents. Also, the volume of generated oily waste can be minimized by the application of intelligent computational techniques, because the optimal oil spill response also takes waste management into the consideration.
Mohammadiun’s research was published recently in the Journal of Hazardous Materials. The paper is part of the Multi-Partner Research Initiative (MPRI), supported by Fisheries and Oceans Canada. The MPRI aims to help the oil spill response industry and regulators to enhance response preparedness in Canadian waters.
