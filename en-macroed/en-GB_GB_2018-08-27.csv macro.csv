Post after post, it sometimes seems like everyone is wearing the same skirt, doing the same pose and writing the same generic captions. It’s almost as if they’re robots. Well, in fact, some of them are.Step forward Miquela (@liliquela), an artificial intelligence 'influencer'. With 1.3 million Instagram followers, she’s just like any other fashion blogger with perfectly planned posts, a themed feed and a penchant for sharing useful advice. But what makes her different? She’s entirely fake.Miquela might be artificial, but that hasn’t stopped the fashion world from embracing her. In February this year, she collaborated with Prada for Milan Fashion Week, by posting 3D-generated gifs of herself at the Milan show venue wearing the spring/summer 2018 collection. Over on Prada's Instagram account, she gave their followers a mini tour of the space, just like any influencer would for a brand. Prada isn't the only brand that's embracing the virtual world. Balmain announced yesterday that it now has a ""Balmain Army"" that features CGI models Margot, Shudu and Zhi who showcase the latest designs from its BBox line. There's even a dedicated modelling agency for digital models, including the faux face who started it all, the world's first digital supermodel, Shudu. She has featured on the cover of Hypebeast, in the pages of V Magazine wearing cool It-brands like Balenciaga and Kenzo, and has most recently made an appearance in Vogue. She even has a record out. With all of these achievements, it's unsurprising that she was named one of the most influential people on the internet by Time.The concept of artificial intelligence is still regarded as daunting, having long been associated with bleak dystopia. Films such as the Matrix and Stanley Kubrick’s A Space Odyssey, and books including Mary Shelley’s classic Frankenstein, all explore how AI could threaten and devalue humanity.That’s not the message Miquela wants to give when people come across her. “I read comments every day about fearing me, plus people toss around phrases like 'robots are taking over',” she told us via email. (Or did she? It's admittedly hard to ascertain the authenticity of a virtual reality model communicating with you via email.)“At the end of the day, I just want to be kind, uplift others, spread acceptance and share my story.”Miquela wants to quell any worries about virtual models replacing real-life models by highlighting their similarities. “You know, Instagram curation is so important,” she says. “I think a lot of humans and robots like to present the best possible version of themselves on social media.”She has a point and despite not actually existing, Miquela uses Instagram in the way we all do. It's easy to forget that the majority of posts we see are meticulously edited and don't represent the reality of life. Giving all your attention to the on-screen world instead of the real one can be toxic. Instagram was voted the worst app last year for negatively impacting issues such as anxiety, depression, loneliness, bullying and body image. Miquela says that even robots get trolled sometimes.“People write a lot of really messed up stuff.  I guess they’re called Internet trolls?  I used to take it to heart,  but now I've learned how to take that energy, frustration, and anger and put it into my music.”That said, when social media is used in the right way it can evoke change, create powerful messages and connect people all over the world.“Social media can be influential in a positive and inspiring way,"" Miquela agrees. ""I'm connected with people from all over the world that I would never be able to meet. It’s extraordinary how social media can bring all of us together.”So what’s next for Instagram's most famous robot influencer? It's clear that the fashion world loves her. “With so many fashion innovators out there, I hope I can work with more designers I love to help express their vision,” she says.She's even hoping to make an appearance at Fashion Week this September. ""I hope so [to attend]. Everything tends to be last minute, so until then I'll be on my laptop refreshing my Gmail account.""Miquela is much more than a passing fad. She makes us question what’s real and what’s not, a pertinent issue in today’s social media climate. She's a reminder that we shouldn’t take everything we see on Instagram as aspirational, because chances are, it’s probably fake.",743.0,Fashion,"[{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'height': 1200, 'thumbnail': 'https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/miquela-blue-poppy-1-1535726330.jpg?crop=0.563xw:1.00xh;0.219xw,0&resize=100:*', 'url': 'https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/miquela-blue-poppy-1-1535726330.jpg?crop=0.563xw:1.00xh;0.219xw,0&resize=1200:*', 'width': 1200}, {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'height': 900, 'thumbnail': 'https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/miquela-blue-poppy-1-1535726330.jpg?crop=0.563xw:1.00xh;0.219xw,0&resize=100:*', 'url': 'https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/miquela-blue-poppy-1-1535726330.jpg?crop=0.7498666666666667xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*', 'width': 1200}, {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'height': 675, 'thumbnail': 'https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/miquela-blue-poppy-1-1535726330.jpg?crop=0.563xw:1.00xh;0.219xw,0&resize=100:*', 'url': 'https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/miquela-blue-poppy-1-1535726330.jpg?crop=0.9998222222222223xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*', 'width': 1200}]","{'@id': 'https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/fashion-news/a22722480/how-artificial-intelligence-models-are-taking-over-your-instagram-feed/', '@type': 'WebPage'}","{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': ""Harper's BAZAAR"", 'sameAs': ['https://twitter.com/BazaarUK', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/harpersbazaaruk/', 'https://www.facebook.com/harpersbazaaruk', 'http://instagram.com/bazaaruk/', 'https://www.pinterest.com/bazaaruk/'], 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/logo-jsonld.3f593bd.png', 'width': 312, 'height': 60}, 'parentOrganization': {'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'Hearst Corporation'}}",https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/fashion-news/a22722480/how-artificial-intelligence-models-are-taking-over-your-instagram-feed/,https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/fashion-news/a22722480/how-artificial-intelligence-models-are-taking-over-your-instagram-feed/,"{'name': 'Jessica Davis', 'url': 'https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/author/209070/jessica-davis/', '@type': 'Person', 'description': ""<p>Jessica Davis is <em>Harper's Bazaar</em> UK's digital writer.

But music-making AI software has advanced so far in the past few years that it’s no longer a frightening novelty; it’s a viable tool that can and is being used by producers to help in the creative process. This raises the question: could artificial intelligence one day replace musicians? For the second episode of The Future of Music, I went to LA to visit the offices of AI platform Amper Music and the home of Taryn Southern, a pop artist who is working with Amper and other AI platforms to co-produce her debut album I AM AI.

Using AI as a tool to make music or aid musicians has been in practice for quite some time. In the ‘90s, David Bowie helped develop an app called the Verbasizer, which took literary source material and randomly reordered the words to create new combinations that could be used as lyrics. In 2016, researchers at Sony used software called Flow Machines to create a melody in the style of The Beatles. This material was then turned over to human composer Benoît Carré and developed into a fully produced pop song called “Daddy’s Car.” (Flow Machines was also used to help create an entire album’s worth of music under the name SKYGGE, which is Danish for “shadow.”) On a consumer level, the technology is already integrated with popular music-making programs like Logic, a piece of software that is used by musicians around the world, and it can auto-populate unique drum patterns with the help of AI.

""AI is already integrated with consumer music-making programs like Logic""

Now, there’s an entire industry built around AI services for creating music, including the aforementioned Flow Machines, IBM Watson Beat, Google Magenta’s NSynth Super, Jukedeck, Melodrive, Spotify’s Creator Technology Research Lab, and Amper Music.

Most of these systems work by using deep learning networks, a type of AI that’s reliant on analyzing large amounts of data. Basically, you feed the software tons of source material, from dance hits to disco classics, which it then analyzes to find patterns. It picks up on things like chords, tempo, length, and how notes relate to one another, learning from all the input so it can write its own melodies. There are differences between platforms: some deliver MIDI while others deliver audio. Some learn purely by examining data, while others rely on hard-coded rules based on musical theory to guide their output. 

However, they all have one thing in common: on a micro scale, the music is convincing, but the longer you listen, the less sense it makes. None of them are good enough to craft a Grammy Award-winning song on their own... yet.

Of all the music-making AI platforms I’ve tried out, Amper is hands down the easiest to use. IBM and Google’s projects require some coding knowledge and unpacking of developer language on GitHub. They also give you MIDI output, not audio, so you also have to have a bit more knowledge about music production to shape the output into an actual song.

Amper, on the other hand, has an interface that is ridiculously simple. All you have to do is go to the website and pick a genre of music and a mood. That’s it. You don’t have to know code or composition or even music theory in order to make a song with it. It builds tracks from prerecorded samples and spits out actual audio, not MIDI. From there, you can change the tempo, the key; mute individual instruments, or switch out entire instrument kits to shift the mood of the song its made. This audio can then be exported as a whole or as individual layers of instruments (known as “stems”). Stems can then be further manipulated in DAWs like Ableton or Logic.

I had Amper generate the clip of music below while cruising around LA in the back seat of my friend’s car. Using my phone, I picked rock as the genre, and then, appropriately, “driving” as the mood. It spent about a minute churning away before delivering 30 seconds of audio. The result isn’t radio-ready, but it has chords, a little structure, and it sounds... pleasant. It could easily sit in the back of a YouTube video or an advertisement and no one would guess it was coded, not written.

As someone who makes music, the idea that code can do what I do is freaky. It’s unnerving to think that an algorithm can make a not-terrible song in minutes and that AI is getting in on creative turf we categorize as distinctly human. If AI is currently good enough to make jingly elevator music like the clip above, how long until it can create a number one hit? And if it gets to that point, what does it mean for human musicians?

These aren’t questions that Taryn Southern is concerned with. Southern is an online personality who you might know from her YouTube channel or when she was a contestant on American Idol. These days, Southern is interested in emerging tech, which has led to her current project: recording a pop album. Those two things don’t sound like they could be related, but her album has a twist: instead of writing all the songs herself, Southern used artificial intelligence to help generate percussion, melodies, and chords. This makes it one of the first albums of its kind, a collaboration of sorts between AI and human.

Amper was the first AI platform Southern used when beginning her album, and now she also works with IBM Watson Beat and Google Magenta. She views AI as a powerful tool and partner, not a replacement for musicians. 

“Using AI, I’m writing my lyrics and my vocal melodies to the actual music and using that as a source of inspiration,” Southern tells me. “I find that really fun, and because I’m able to iterate with the music and give it feedback and parameters and edit as many times as I need, it still feels like it’s mine in a sense.”

""AI isn’t good enough to craft a hit radio song on its own... yet""

To get an idea of how a human can work with AI, look at Southern’s 2017 single, “Break Free.” The SoundCloud audio below is an early export of material from Amper. Compare that to the YouTube video that has the final, released version of the song. Bits of the AI-composed original peek through here and there, but it’s more like seasoning, not the main dish. To transform it into a pop song, Southern made a lot of creative decisions, including switching instruments, changing the key, and, of course, writing and performing the vocals.

[Media: https://soundcloud.com/tarynsouthern/break-free-pre-arranged-no-vocals-only-ai/s-MlqhD]

[Media: https://youtu.be/XUs6CznN8pw]

Southern originally turned to AI because even though she was a songwriter, she knew “very, very little about music theory.” It was a roadblock that frustrated her to no end. “I’d find a beautiful chord on the piano,” Southern says, “and I’d write an entire song around that, but then I couldn’t get to the next few chords because I just didn’t know how to play what I was hearing in my head. Now I’m able to iterate with the music and give it feedback and parameters and edit as many times as I need. It still feels like it’s mine in a sense.”

This feeling of empowerment is exactly what Amper Music is trying to deliver. “I don’t look at it like artificial intelligence,” Amper co-founder Michael Hobe says. “It’s more of intelligence augmentation. We can facilitate your creative process to cut a lot of the bullshit elements of it. For me, it’s allowing more people to be creative and then allowing the people who already have some of these creative aspects to really further themselves.”

When Hobe says “bullshit elements,” he’s talking about a guitarist not knowing how to orchestrate an instrument they’ve never worked with before, the time spent crafting the velocity of individual drum hits, or simply being faced with writer’s block. Amper isn’t meant to create the next AI superstar; it’s meant to enable musicians. Of course, using AI also has the added benefit of allowing Southern and others with no formal music background to participate in making music. It democratizes the creative playing field so anyone can play what they hear in their head, just like Southern.

""it’s not about creating the next AI superstar; it’s about enabling musicians""

I ask Southern what she would say to people who think using AI is cheating. “Great,” she says. “Yes, we are totally cheating. If music is concretely defined as this one process that everyone must adhere to in order to get to some sort of end goal, then, yes, I’m cheating. I am leading the way for all the cheaters.” She laughs, and then pointedly says, “The music creation process can’t be so narrowly defined.”

It’s something to think about. Every time a new technology is introduced and that tectonically shifts the way we create music, there are naysayers. Things like AutoTune, the use of samples and loops, and Digital Audio Workstations were all “disruptors” that we adapted to and are now commonplace tools and methods. AI will probably be next.

The technology’s impact on the music industry as a whole remains to be seen. Will it destroy jobs? How will it affect musical copyright? Will it ever be able to work without a human? But people like Hobe and Southern believe it will ultimately reap positive benefits. Sure, an algorithm making music sounds scary because it mirrors human capabilities that we already find mysterious, but it’s also a compelling tool that can enhance said human capabilities. AI as a collaborator increases access to music-making, it can streamline workflows, and it provides the spark of inspiration needed to craft your next hit single.

“You’re collaborating and working with the AI to achieve your goal,” Hobe says. “It’s not that the AI is just doing its own little thing. It’s all about the process between it and you to achieve that final artistic vision.”

Amper isn’t meant to create the next AI superstar; it’s meant to enable musicians. Of course, using AI also has the added benefit of allowing Southern and others with no formal music background to participate in making music. It democratizes the creative playing field so anyone can play what they hear in their head, just like Southern.it’s not about creating the next AI superstar; it’s about enabling musiciansI ask Southern what she would say to people who think using AI is cheating. “Great,” she says. “Yes, we are totally cheating. If music is concretely defined as this one process that everyone must adhere to in order to get to some sort of end goal, then, yes, I’m cheating. I am leading the way for all the cheaters.” She laughs, and then pointedly says, “The music creation process can’t be so narrowly defined.”It’s something to think about. Every time a new technology is introduced and that tectonically shifts the way we create music, there are naysayers. Things like AutoTune, the use of samples and loops, and Digital Audio Workstations were all “disruptors” that we adapted to and are now commonplace tools and methods. AI will probably be next.The technology’s impact on the music industry as a whole remains to be seen. Will it destroy jobs? How will it affect musical copyright? Will it ever be able to work without a human? But people like Hobe and Southern believe it will ultimately reap positive benefits. Sure, an algorithm making music sounds scary because it mirrors human capabilities that we already find mysterious, but it’s also a compelling tool that can enhance said human capabilities. AI as a collaborator increases access to music-making, it can streamline workflows, and it provides the spark of inspiration needed to craft your next hit single.“You’re collaborating and working with the AI to achieve your goal,” Hobe says. “It’s not that the AI is just doing its own little thing. It’s all about the process between it and you to achieve that final artistic vision.”Comments0 Comments / 0 NewFeatured Videos From The VergeThe ups and downs of being a political TikToker

Since 1953, when the term Artificial Intelligence was coined by John McCarthy in the  Dartmouth Conference, we have achieved unthinkable highs: we have taught machines to see, to recognize images or text; we have taught them to read, to listen, speak, or translate. In spite of all of that, they are not even close to achieving full human-capacities; they don’t comprehend, they don’t understand or learn further beyond the environment in which they are placed. They have unmatched computing power, but little to none true creativity; a superb ability to combine and analyze probabilities, but not a single spark of unsupervised creativity. If someone tells you that the “singularity”, the moment in which Artificial Intelligence achieves a definitive human-like character and overpasses our own biological limits on intelligence, is around the corner they are a bit too optimist -the consensus among experts in that we are still decades away from a singularity point, and some think we might never get to a true human-like intelligence-.
Regardless of the time to a future in which we have to address machines as intellectually equal or superior, the revolution of AI is unstoppable in so many other ways. The amount of resources and talent devoted by the largest global corporations is accelerating a new industrial revolution in which the speed of adoption is increasingly faster than the pace of adaptation.

The fact that increasingly complex automation is applied to problems that were solved entirely by humans opens the door to great opportunities but also to fallouts and shortcomings. According to consulting firm Accenture, American companies are expected to invest 35 trillion dollars in cognitive technologies before 2035, and that does not take into account other big players, such us Europe, China or Japan. Governments, such the French, are recognizing the importance of AI for the economy and the society. In Spain, the Ministry of Digital Agenda (Minetad) has created a group of experts that is working on a White Paper on AI.
The fact that an increasingly more complex automation is applied to problems that not long ago were part of a human task opens the door to many opportunities, but also to risks, threats and misunderstandings. In this scenario we should be more concerned about the human bias introduced in AI that about self-conscious killing machines. To avoid misuse, ethical norms have to be in the core of AI development and answer questions such as “how” and “what for”. 

An ethical development, must help to fight biases and discrimination, provide transparency, audits of models and a strict respect for privacy.
The new AI could be used to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, as well as to win a war. The disparity of dilemmas that these technologies bring to the table are well beyond the engineering domain, even though knowledge of the intricacies of the technology is necessary to deconstruct the problem.


There are initiatives that are creating a trail of principles and rules, such as the 23 principles of Asilomar. In fact, more voices ask for a global consensus of minimum rules for the role of AI in society; something the European Union is starting to explore.
Killer Machines
As early as 1942, Isaac Asimov was able to envision a world in which Artificial Intelligence needed to be governed by basic laws. An AI that makes life and death decisions requires clear ethical norms that limit the possibility of AI negligence or weaponized AI (see Project Maven and Google), as explained in the dystopian short film ‘Slaughterbots’, by Stuart Russell. 
In part, to correct the perception on the role of AI in the company’s future, Google recently released  a new set of principles that will guide them in the application of new AI capabilities, including a rejection of lethal applications of AI.
Intelligent machines are going to be embedded in every infrastructure, from air traffic, the electric grid or urban planning. The imminence of self-driving cars, trucks or passenger planes generates understandable public concern and requires solid safeguards to avoid hacking, unfair decision-making or proper response to unexpected events.
Government, civil society, academia, and businesses have to establish communication channels to implement measures that reduce the impact and occurrence of errors. Furthermore, they have to create platforms in which to measure and correct algorithmic-based decision that perpetuate or widen inequality. In this early stage of human-taught machines there is a high possibility that machine learning designers transmit on purpose or inadvertently biases that make society more unfair instead of moving us forward in the opposite direction.

To correct these problems increased transparency will be essential. The use of “black boxes” in the creation of machine learning models could worsen if intelligent machines are trusted with decision-making. The ability of these machines to “explain” the reasoning behind such a decision will improve accountability, supervision and avoid giving full control to artificial agents.
Unemployed by machines
The next challenge is how to integrate AI in a world where different levels of economic development, political priorities and skilled workforces coexist. The G20 is already working on measures to mitigate the impact of work automation in developed countries and in certain sectors that are likely to be highly automated in the next few decades. Ideas such as basic income or “taxing robots” should be, at least, considered by policy makers in order to correct extreme inequalities, and send a large number of citizens to the fringes of society and without the necessary resources to be incorporated in the AI economy.

As Economists Anton Korinek and Joseph Stiglitz put it: “innovation could lead to a few very rich individuals, whereas the vast majority of ordinary workers may be left behind, with wages far below what they were at the peak of the industrial age”.

Augmented by machines
But the creative potential of AI is much greater and offsets any other. AI in the workplace could equip workers with almost superhuman abilities to perform complex tasks, that take advantage of vasts amounts of information, personalizing services to a level that even the customer deems impossible today.
An “augmented” AI worker can complete better distributed and fairer transactions or services, that could bring the world to a new era of development and inclusion. Not only tedious tasks will be eventually eliminated, humans will have more time to reflect on the true purpose of new technologies or have greater impact in their communities.
Medical diagnosis could be almost flawless, the process of preventing or finding solutions in possible advert scenarios could be analyzed in record time. Education, healthcare or financial services (key components in an AI-driven economy) would become more accessible, even for those that have had unequal access up until today, because a personalized path for inclusion could be built for each one. At the same time humans won’t have to be exposed to dangerous or eroding jobs, creating a services-only type of workforce.

The use of AI for social good help us identify hidden needs in vulnerable parts of the population, find insights in the way wealth is transmitted and circulates through the economic system, fight corruption, fraud and crime. AI can also facilitate channels for a more direct, participatory democracy, speed up bureaucratic processes, and improve budgetary prioritization. For all these goals to be achievable these AI tools should incorporate elements that are increasingly present in the debate of the development of automation: “Privacy by Design”, “Ethics by Design”, “Fairness by Design”, “Sustainable by Design”, “Transparent by Design”, etc.

In conclusion: the augmented capacities that AI is going to add to our capacity to process information and make decisions should improve our lives in general, should eliminate tedious tasks in the workplace, will increase productivity in the medium to long run, and, most likely, will free us to undertake more creative tasks or simply to reduce the workload per capita. The shortcomings that could be originated during this complex transition have to be tackled not only from a technological perspective, but also from a socioeconomic or ethical point of view. The design of effective political frameworks and accountability should be a necessary component if we want to extract the full potential of AI technologies.

The benefits and downfalls of AI in the construction industry

 August 31, 2018  5079 




New research by Powertools2U has outlined the benefits and negatives of artificial intelligence and what the technology can bring to the construction industry
The use of artificial intelligence has significantly increased over the last few years and has been implemented into the construction sector to bring about advancements in risk mitigation, safety and generative design processes.
Risk Mitigation
By using Construction Language Analysis, from tools such as Autodesk BIM 360 software, algorithms are able to understand complex data and predict potential problems.
Safety
Researchers from Waterloo University in Canada have discovered that by using AI technology in the construction industry and scanning software, they can track the body movement of bricklayers to analyse their form in order to reduce the amount of injuries on-site.
In addition, AI lends itself to face recognition to ensure complete safety and to authorise qualified professionals.


Generative design process
AI can be used to measure a project’s parameters which is then fed into a computer which understands the data and requirements of their physical location.
Design options are then generated and sent to the architect to match the needs of the client.
Drawbacks
Alternatively, the technology’s ability to replicate human work has also led to a dramatic job loss which has impacted the sector’s current workforce.
According to leading design and consultancy firm, Arcadis, a shortfall in human workers has led to an increase of AI in the construction industry.
Arcadis have said that the construction sector needs to recruit over 400,000 workers each year between now and 2021 to keep up with demand. They added that this figure does not include the amount of workers the UK will lose out on due to Brexit.
Research conducted by international construction company Mace, predicts that 600,000 jobs could be lost within the construction industry out of the 2.2 million positions currently held, all of which will be lost to automation by 2040.
Unfortunately, brick layers are set to be hit the most with 73,000 workers expected to drop to 4,300
With the amount of AI in the construction industry, many have predicted when we will see a human-free construction force.
The following estimations include:
2018 – Saas Solutions permeate the industry
2019 – AR and IoT go mainstream
2020 – Pre-fabrication and 3D productions soar
2021 – Regulations allow 24/7 drone monitoring of projects
2022  – self-guided machines appear on-site
2023 – AI allowed to manage first project
2024 – Autonomous machine takes over
2025 – Decline in human workforce – rise of tech

An unhealthy, dangerous or otherwise toxic workspace is known to deter workers from innovation and damage a company's reputation. Entrepreneurs have a responsibility to ensure that working environments keep employees safe, satisfied and positive so they can remain productive and innovative on the job.With the focus on workplace health management programs, along with the emergence of AI technologies, it's crucial to understand how these disruptive tools will affect the health -- mental, social and physical -- of workers across various sectors.AI is promising to change the way workplaces operate, but will it be a force for good or disrupt workplace culture in negative ways? With the expectation that AI will create a $190.6 billion market by 2025, it could be a tool used to provide healthier, more productive, and accessible work environments for all employees.



From hazardous to healthyToxic work environments, whether physically or mentally toxic, can take a toll on workers' well-being and productivity. It's estimated that companies lose up to $300 billion annually because of absentee workers with high stress levels, according to the American Institute of Stress.Surveys and workplace trends have pointed to the fact that emerging technologies, like AI, can play a significant role over the next several years and beyond. For example, they can effectively adopt meditative practices into the workplace, employee support, and improvements to communication to name a few. Strategic health-focused strategies can align employees' well-being and the company's mission, vision, and core values.


Companies are beginning to implement more health initiatives to retain employees and revenue. Surveys and research including a 2017 study from the American Psychological Association Center found that 61 percent of working Americans experience chronic work-related stress.Related: This Is How to Get Started With AI When the Only Thing You Know Is the AcronymWell-being technology in the workplaceAlready, well-being technology is upending the way workplaces run. A series of workplace innovations are integrated with workforce monitoring, trackers, digital platforms, and occupational health and safety technologies. Cloud platforms integrate an organization's wellness programming into the company's digital infrastructure, all while capturing data that engages with employees across the business, and actively communicating information with them. Platforms, trackers and workforce monitoring tools are interconnected via wearable or app-based activity tracking devices and, with the help of AI, they're about to get even better. Emotional well-being technology is also on the rise in workplaces. Apps like Ginger.io provide emotional counseling with the help of AI pattern recognition platforms.These device capture employee information through employee input or an automated tracker, but some e-health companies now offer metrics and action plans on combined outputs with real-time advice and guidance through big data and machine learning. Companies like Glint use AI and natural language processing to capture and analyze qualitative data from various sources.


According to a report on The Future of Technology in Workplace Wellbeing from Uprise founder Dr. Jay Spence, early evidence suggests that tech is acceptable and positively affects outcomes in the workplace.However, companies still have a long way to go to make technology an enabler of office health. A recent Colliers study has found that only 26 percent of companies subsidize the cost of fitness-tracking tools to support employee health and fitness such as Fitbit trackers, but this number is expected to increase significantly by 2020.In other areas, for example, AI-enabled wearable tools imbued with machine learning algorithms and natural language processing can help identify workers who struggle with productivity or happiness in the office with the following approaches:Cognitive insightsAI metrics can also identify patterns, referred to as cognitive insights. They can accurately process large troves of highly detailed employee data, while improving upon their predictive analytics for work behaviors and patterns as time goes on. Types of machine learning, deep learning specifically, can attempt to mimic human brain activity to recognize these patterns, even identifying images and speech. It configures higher probable matches in behavior amongst data associated with the same person or company, even if it's in different formats.


For example, GE has utilized this tool to incorporate supplier data, saving $80 million with the elimination of redundancies and negotiating contracts as part of an employee business task. Overall, cognitive insights can target its insights for job performance when paired with wellness technology to identify behavior speech patterns and modes or working that are either unhealthy or dangerous to others.Related: Think Twice About a Company When You Keep Hearing These 4 AI BuzzwordsCognitive engagements The Harvard Business Review also reports that companies surveyed in their study report using cognitive engagements to interact with employees even more so than with customers. Cognitive engagement provides employees with:Intelligent agents that can answer questions and provide support in an employee's natural languageInternal sites for answering employee questions on topics including IT, employee benefits, and HR policyPersonalized and engaging communications between higher-ups and other employeesHealth treatment recommendation systems that allow companies to create customized care plans that considers the patients' health status of workers and their previous treatments (which still remain confidential to the employer)Workplace relationshipsIn terms of HR and employee relationships, AI can help provide smoother insights to create cohesive and innovative team dynamics. HR pros and CEOs, for instance, can use Etch, an AI-led contact manager that provides insights to identify the progress, roles, and projects for each employee through a data-filtered system. A unified database can be searched and filtered to offer intelligent information on an entrepreneur's contacts and employees.


AI can also track and assess how well team members collaborate with each other. Humanyze, a startup, provides smart ID badges that track employees throughout the office, reporting data to employers on how well employees interact and collaborate during the day. Overall, AI can help increase the predictive power used in team collaboration and innovation. Although this may sound a bit intrusive, employers have been monitoring employees habits on their work computers since computers became popular. Besides, employees often passively consent to workplace surveillance when they sign their contracts.With AI insights, employees and HR can build more trusting and smoother relationships that allow for improved transparency and innovation in the workplace, offering a healthier work culture.Related: What Is AI, Anyway? Know Your Stuff With This Go-To Guide.Office designIn addition to workplace relationships and wearable tech, AI can also help improve physical and mental health through office design. Buildings that take advantage of AI provide an opportunity to personalize and create spaces that feel open and limitless for better productivity, transparency and safety.


For example, research finds that the human mind's need to connect to nature increases productivity by 15 percent. But how does AI help? AI can assess mood through personalized, input data or emotional well-being technology to determine if employees should need physical or environmental stimuli. Automated sensors systems built into offices could adjust the natural lighting of the building throughout the day.AI can even remember to water plants. Autonomous internal watering systems like the Arudino Powered Watering System can give offices control over keeping their sustainable environments. And since the biophilic craze has become part of modern office design, Gensler's Office Workplace Productivity survey suggests that including technology like AI is an essential tool to help workers determine how they're working in these spaces with real-time data and updates advising when they need to move into different workspaces or take a break.When it comes to safety, AI can also monitor and recognize movements and speech patterns that are considered dangerous or hazardous to employee safety. If there is an emergency, devices like Orion Lab's Panic Bot will automatically notify teammates of emergencies or hazards. Benevolent intelligence software from the likes of One Concern can map an environment like a city or office so first responders know how to assess a natural disaster or emergency situation.


A healthy employee is a happy employee and with AI's assistance and the workplace could become a solutions-driven environment that brings together the best qualities of each worker. A study conducted by The Workforce Institute at Kronos Incorporated found that four out of five surveyed employees think there is a significant opportunity for AI to create more engaging and empowering workspaces and experiences. While some may be unsure about AI's place in the workplace, ultimately, it will be a tool used to reshape the way workers feel, operate, and produce quality work. AI could finally help us like work again.

If you are still taking a ""wait and see"" approach to artificial intelligence, you may already be falling behind your peers in IT. Although just 15 percent of enterprises are using AI, 31 percent said that it was on the agenda for the next 12 months, according to Adobe's February 2018 “Digital Trends” report. That number will only go up as machine learning and AI technology continues to change how we work, live, and think. Along these lines, Mary Meeker's 2018 Internet trends report cited AI as a hot growth area for IT spending.
There is plenty of hype-filled speculation about what the future of AI will look like. But most leaders just want to know what they can do now to better prepare themselves, their teams, and their businesses for what lies ahead.

A new piece of software adapts the facial expressions of people in videos to match an audio track dubbed over the film

Dubbing films could become significantly easier in the future. A team led by researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Informatics in Saarbrücken has developed a software package that can adapt actors’ mouth movements and whole facial expressions to match the film’s translation. The technique uses methods based on artificial intelligence and could save the film industry a considerable amount of time and money when it comes to dubbing films. The software can also correct the gaze and head pose of participants in a video conference to boost the impression of a natural conversation setting.

Film translators and dubbing actors work within a set of rigid limitations. After all, they must ensure that the words they put into actors’ mouths not only accurately reproduce what was said but also correspond to the actors’ lip movements and facial expressions. Now, an international team led by researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Informatics has presented a technique known as Deep Video Portraits at the SIGGRAPH computer graphics conference in Vancouver. This technique does away with the need to synchronize the translated audio track with the facial expressions in the video footage. Instead, the software can adapt the actors’ facial expressions – and above all their lip movements – to match the translation.
The software was developed by a team involving not only the Max Planck researchers in Saarbrücken but also scientists from the University of Bath, Technicolor, the Technical University of Munich (TUM), and Stanford University. In contrast to existing methods, which can only animate the facial expressions found in videos, the new technique also adapts the head pose, gaze, and eye blinking. It can even synthesize a plausible static video background if the head moves.
The technique could transform the visual entertainment industry
In order to reproduce features realistically, the researchers use a model of the face in conjunction with methods based on artificial intelligence. “We work with model-based 3D face performance capture to record the detailed movements of the eyebrows, mouth, nose, and head position of the dubbing actor in a video,” explains Hyeongwoo Kim, a researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics. ""It works by using model-based 3D face performance capture to record the detailed movements of the eyebrows, mouth, nose, and head position of the dubbing actor in a video.""
For the time being, the research merely demonstrates a new concept, and the method has yet to be put into practice. However, the researchers believe that the technique could completely transform sections of the visual entertainment industry. “Despite extensive post-production manipulation, dubbing films into foreign languages always presents a mismatch between the actor on screen and the dubbed voice,” says Christian Theobalt, who leads a research group at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics and played a key role in the current work. “Our new Deep Video Portraits approach enables us to modify the appearance of a target actor by transferring head pose, facial expressions, and eye motion with a high level of realism.”
More natural conversation settings in video conferencing
As well as a realistic rendering of films into other languages, the method also has a range of other applications in film production. “This technique could also be used for post-production in the film industry, where computer graphics editing of faces is already widely used in today’s feature films,” says Christian Richardt, who participated in the project on behalf of the University of Bath’s motion capture research centre CAMERA. One example of this type of editing is The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, where Brad Pitt’s face was replaced with a modified computer graphics version in nearly every frame of the film. Until now, interventions such as this often required many weeks of work by trained artists. “Deep Video Portraits shows how such a visual effect could be created with less effort in the future,” says Richardt. With the new approach, the positioning of an actor’s head and their facial expression could easily be edited in order to subtly alter the camera angle or framing of a scene and thus to tell the story better.
In addition, the new technique could also be used in video and VR teleconferencing, for example, where people typically look at the screen and not into the camera. As a result, they don’t appear to be looking into the eyes of their conversation partners on the other end of the video link. With Deep Video Portraits, the gaze and head pose could be corrected to create a more natural conversation setting.
Neuronal networks detect videos that have been edited
The software paves the way for a host of new creative applications in visual media production, but the authors are also aware of the potential for misuse of modern video editing technology. Whereas the media industry has been editing photos for many years, it is now increasingly easy to edit videos – and with increasingly convincing results. Given the constant improvements in video editing technology, we must also start being more critical about video content, just as we already are about photos, especially if there is no proof of origin, says Michael Zollhöfer from Stanford University. “We believe that the field of digital forensics should and will receive a lot more attention in the future to develop approaches that can automatically prove the authenticity of a video clip.”
Zollhöfer is convinced that, with better methods, it will be possible to spot modifications of this kind in future, even if we humans might not be able to spot them with our own eyes. This issue is also being addressed by the researchers who presented the new video editing software. They are developing neuronal networks that are trained to detect synthetically generated or edited video with high precision in order to make it much easier to spot forgeries.
The scientists currently have no plans to make the video modification software publicly available. Moreover, they say that any such software should leave watermarks in videos in order to clearly mark modifications.

With about 1 million robots in use in Asia, robotics and automation mean economic risks and growth opportunities for the region. For Asia to fully reap this digital opportunity as the world’s main engine of growth, countries need to revamp their education systems and invest in innovation to support a workforce for humans and robots alike.
As digital technologies like artificial intelligence transform business models, the rise of industrial robot usage—robotics used for manufacturing, for example in welding—in Asia signals a change is underway.
As our chart of the week from the last Regional Economic Outlook: Asia Pacific shows, Asia is at the forefront of automation with an estimated 65 percent of the world’s total industrial robot usage for 2017. In Asia, China is now the single biggest user of these robots with an estimated 50 percent of the region’s total industrial robot usage, followed by Korea and Japan. 

It comes as no surprise then that Asia, with all these robots, has the highest robot density, which is the number of industrial robots per 10,000 workers. Korea and Singapore are global leaders in robot density, followed by Germany and Japan.
Further, Asia may be the global leader in employing industrial robots, but it is also the region with the highest robot production—Japan and Korea are the world’s top two producers, with market shares of 52 and 12 percent, respectively.
Robot takeover
With more than half of the world’s estimated stock of industrial robots in use, Asia’s investments in robotics show how crucial the automation of production is for the region’s economies.
Yet, automation and digitalization are not new. Recent advances in computing power and powerful data generation equip robotics with more cognitive capability, such as the latest generation of robots that can collect data to adapt their movements in real time. This means that more complex work that could only be done by humans can now be done by machines. 
This trend could mean trouble for workers in Asia where relatively low-cost and low-skilled labor has been the basis for the region’s role as “the factory to the world.” More robots than humans doing technical work may bring down the cost of business, including labor costs, significantly. As a result, workers are displaced as producers are more likely to employ robots that cost less and perform more effectively, rather than having to pay wages.
Digital divide vs. digital dividend
The movement towards more automation and digitalization may bring global economic challenges, but it also provides opportunities for Asia to bolster its economy and reap the digital dividend—the economic benefits that come from going digital. 
To maintain its global competitiveness and to keep the world’s main engine of growth running, Asia’s policymakers need to tackle disruptions caused by automation and robots by supporting job creation without stifling innovation. This fine balance is easier said than done, but policies that can help include:

Equipping job seekers with globally competitive skillsets by revamping education
Investing in physical and regulatory infrastructure that supports entrepreneurship, innovation, and competition; and
Addressing labor-market and social challenges, including income redistribution and safety nets.

Stay tuned for more details on policies to accomplish this shift in the upcoming October 2018 Regional Economic Outlook: Asia Pacific. The report focuses on the digital economy and the economic impact of digitalization and automation developments in Asia, and policies to reap digital dividends.

Which Cities are Hiring the Most A.I. and Machine Learning Experts?

Machine learning and artificial intelligence (A.I.) are two of the most-hyped concepts in technology at the moment. Even businesses without the budget to afford a platoon of subject-matter experts want to leverage machine learning to make their processes “smarter.” Meanwhile, tech giants such as Google hope that A.I. can remake the world, or at least change how we drive to work every day. But where are the actual A.I. jobs? According to a new study by Indeed, the highest concentration of these positions is in New York City, with 11.6 percent of the site’s job postings. San Francisco came in second, with 9.6 percent, followed by San Jose with 9.2 percent. Washington D.C. (7.9 percent) and Boston (6.1 percent) rounded out the top five. These results aren’t surprising. New York, San Francisco, San Jose, and Boston are huge tech hubs; Washington D.C. features government agencies, defense contractors, and consulting firms that are all attempting to figure out how to best make A.I. work for them. In an accompanying blog posting, Indeed suggested that New York’s variety of “industry centers,” including “media, fashion, and banking,” were responsible for its impressive showing. Despite its second-place showing, Silicon Valley clearly remains dedicated to exploring A.I. “San Jose has the most job postings for algorithm engineers, computer vision engineers and machine learning engineers, which are all in the top four for jobs that most frequently require A.I. or machine learning skills,” that posting added. “San Jose also had the most job postings for research engineers.” Those tech pros with the right combination of A.I.-related skills can make incredible amounts of money. Earlier this year, for example, The New York Times analyzed a tax filing by OpenAI, a nonprofit that specializes in A.I. work, and found that its top researcher, Ilya Sutskever, made nearly $2 million in 2016. Another researcher earned $800,000. Nor is that the ceiling: At a conference in mid-2017, Tom Eck, CTO of industry platforms at IBM, said that “top-tier A.I. researchers are earning the same salaries as NFL quarterbacks.” Many quarterbacks make many millions of dollars per year, so you can imagine what those tech pros make. These high salaries at least partially stem from scarcity: A recent analyst report from McKinsey & Company estimated the number of qualified A.I. experts in the world at fewer than 10,000. And companies know that the A.I. and machine learning market will only get bigger, with the report estimating that the practical applications of artificial intelligence could add a staggering $3.5 trillion to $5.8 trillion in value across various industries over the next several years. We can infer that even those A.I.-trained tech pros who aren’t operating at “NFL quarterback level” can comfortably pull down a six-figure salary—no matter where they live. No matter what the future may hold, learning at least some A.I. skills has some clear benefits on your career.

“You have to deal with robots as part of your workforce,” says Singaporean civil servant June Koh.

She is the Cluster Director of Human Capital at the Info-Communications Media Development Authority (IMDA). Part of her job is to identify skills in demands in the industry and “find emerging skills, emerging demand even before they appear”, she says. This comes from observing trends, analysing data, and a deep understanding of industries. “It’s not just what the companies want today, but what they think they will also need tomorrow.”

Koh shares how her team are working with colleagues and companies to ensure people have the right skills for these jobs.
Skills in AI
 




 
One of the key skills areas IMDA have identified is in artificial intelligence. “That requires you to upskill and rethink the skills that jobs required,” Koh says. For instance, maintenance and cleaning jobs are increasingly being automated.

Along with some jobs changing, “there will also be new jobs that will be created”, she adds, and this will require people to learn new skills. “There will be probably optimisation of jobs - I don't think we will be shy with that.”

The government set up a national programme, AI Singapore (AI.SG), to enhance Singapore’s AI capabilities and drive the future digital economy. IMDA has partnered with AI.SG to run apprenticeships with AI experts in the industry.

Apprentices solve real-world business problems, getting hands-on experience while at it. “We want to work with them to see how we can build in opportunities for Singaporeans to be part of that learning experience,” Koh explains.

[blockquote]“We want to build more in those specific new areas where the existing workforce can also apply and level up and switch careers.”[/blockquote]
Besides government-led programmes, IMDA is lending expertise to various big firms across sectors - banking and telecommunications among them - to help them run various training programmes in areas such as cybersecurity. This is meant to help established professionals in particular: “They pull in mid-careers and enable them to switch,” Koh explains. “We want to build more in those specific new areas where the existing workforce can also apply and level up and switch careers.”
Tomorrow’s skills demand

Two other skills areas that IMDA has identified are in IoT and immersive media, Koh says. IoT will present opportunities in manufacturing or even cyber security, as it has much to do with physical and digital infrastructure. Meanwhile, immersive media - augmented and virtual reality - are entirely new ways to communicate stories and concepts to people, and correspondingly require different methods of production than traditional media.

These may not translate into a great deal more new jobs - rather, “it could be a current job, it's just an extension of skill”, Koh says. IMDA’s role here is to help in “deepening courses available in those fields in order to assist that extension of the current job”.

Koh works closely with various ministries, private sector, business associations and academia to identify what types of ICT skills will be in demand in the coming years. Once she has a clear sense of emerging areas, the next step is to work with industry to see how IMDA can support them in training people in these skills.

IMDA’s teams crunch the numbers, looking at growth projections, internal data, and historical trends to predict skills that will be in demand. The agency has a yearly research survey that helps here. “We also then look at job ads and study the patterns and what kind of job roles they are asking for,” Koh says. Key hirers weigh in through various platforms to give a clearer view of what is going on in industries and “validate some of our hypotheses”, she adds.

The agency holds forums to get feedback from companies on talent recruitment and ICT manpower. “It’s a good way to review and improve the programmes and support available for ICT professionals as well as hirers to narrow any gaps or challenges they may face in ICT talent and skills development,” says Koh.

As Singapore’s industries adapt to AI and other new technologies shaking things up, it is important for any professional to have avenues to learn skills that will hold them in good stead. It might even be possible to pivot mid-career and make the switch to something new.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Durban school kids now have chance to learn about Artificial Intelligence 
by Tyler Leigh Vivier@tylerleighvAugust 31, 2018 712 0 
















 


Grade 3 to 7 learners from RA Padayachee Primary in Durban are learning Artificial Intelligence (AI) during an after-school STEM education programme
 
Technology is growing at a rapid rate and children these days need to have the skills that will enable them to work in a world that is technilogically more advanced than right now. Learning the basics of computational thinking, electrical engineering, mobile computing and robotics will greatly benefit a child today, as they become the adults of tomorrow.
I-Innovate has partnered with U.S. developers, Curiosity Machine to bring the AI Family Challenge to South Africa with aim of ultimately reaching 20 000 learners in disadvantaged communities around the world.  Learners, teachers and family members get together to explore fascinating facets of AI technologies such as machine learning, speech recognition, prediction models, autonomous vehicles and neural networks.  
As learners learn and apply AI concepts, they are inspired to use them to find solutions to pressing community problems when it comes to food, agriculture, health, transportation and energy.  
The ‘learn by doing’ approach to mastering the series of design challenges presented by I-Innovate are aimed at igniting creativity, problem-solving, collaboration and innovation.   The learning experience fosters a strong and valuable sense of empowerment, confidence and inclusion in the learners.
Grade 3 to 7 learners from RA Padayachee Primary and their teachers have stepped into the astounding world of Artificial Intelligence (AI) during an after-school STEM education programme called the AI Family Challenge. Other programmes like this one have been successful in Cape Town.
“With these hands-on design challenges, we make complex AI concepts tangible,” says I-Innovate CEO, Trisha Crookes.  
“For instance, participants understand how autonomous vehicles process different signals by building a system of circuits to simulate sensors and rapid decision-making.   More importantly, over the course of the challenge, participants develop a learner mindset that gives them a lifelong ability to innovate and problem-solve.”
 
“The AI Family Challenge is another inspiring and highly relevant way of showing children in our communities that they can have a meaningful impact today and in the future,” concludes Crookes.Related StoryGood Things Guy and OneCart Bring Mandela Day Joy to 67 Deserving Readers

The prospects of Artificial Intelligence (AI) are thrilling not only for high income economies but also for small ones like Mauritius which are marching towards a transformative journey. AI is expected to permeate every major industry from healthcare to finance, education and transportation. However, in African countries including Mauritius, this technology carries with it a fear of loss of employment. Will AI prove to be more of boon or a bane? Experts shed lights on its impact, consequences and vast opportunities.
Dr Bhavish Jugurnath.In the previous Budget 2018-2019, the Government has put much emphasis on fostering the development of a new growth pole revolving around AI. Worldwide experts predict that AI could contribute up to 15.7 trillion to the global economy in 2030. Similarly, Accenture research states that AI would double annual economic growth rates in 2035 as well as bring various changes in the nature of work between human and machine.
According to the McKinsey Global Institute, AI is contributing to a transformation of society “happening ten times faster and at 300 times the scale or at roughly 3,000 times the impact” of the Industrial Revolution. AI is not a new concept; in fact, this concept was coined in 1956 by the scientist John McCarthy at Dartmouth College, USA. Now after 60 years, this concept has taken a new dimension. Thus, Mauritius cannot lag behind in this rapid transformation.
Loganaden Velvindron.Nevertheless, the main issue has been raised by the World Economic Forum (WEF), which predicts a loss of around five million jobs by 2020 in fields like BPOs, which has been a major pillar for middle class economies like African countries.
Dr. Heman Mohabeer, who is currently Head of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at BIRGER, argues that right now, in Mauritius, there is a significant turmoil in the technological aspect as everyone wants to race toward AI. “AI promises to deliver in terms of opportunities and the way we do business. However, there seem to be some confusion as to how to embark into the so called ‘industry 4.0’, as there are no significant guidelines on how to proceed with the adoption of AI. Natural language processing, Computer vision and blockchain promises to change the technological facet but we need to be cautious since all these revolves around data. Unless we can consolidate our local laws regarding data privacy and transparency, people will either reject or be cautious of AI. After all, much of AI is still a black box and lots of people fail to understand the mechanism behind the wonders of AI/machine learning.” 
Dr Oomesh Gukhool.Dr. Ramesh Caussy, CEO and Founder Partnering Robotics, on his part,  underlines that Mauritius, like most of the countries in Africa, is nowhere as almost nothing has been done during the past 20 years. “We have a lack of leadership in Mauritius and Africa in the fields of technology and AI. Our decision makers and investors do not believe in our potential and explore the usual patterns that build of future chains.”
Impact on Mauritian society
As per the report of the Economist Intelligence Unit, it is expected that AI has a positive impact on growth (90%), productivity (86%), innovation (84%) and job creation (69%) in their countries and industry. In Mauritius, the impact is multifold.
Dr. Oomesh Gukhool, Senior Lecturer at the University of Mauritius, states the small size of the country offers significant challenges. “Our human resource and know-how are major assets which are conducive to an acceptable degree of economic resilience. However, sustaining such resilience necessitates the development of new strategies. One factor that may increase the degree of our economic resilience is through digital transformation. AI will lead to the digital transformation of our island. It can be a major avenue to enhance economic development as well as to improve our quality of life.”
Dr Heman Mohabeer.The Senior Lecturer also adds that AI may help to strengthen national competitiveness. “AI will help to accelerate the pace of innovation in Mauritius. With the right framework, AI can ensure a better democracy with the advent of deep fake detection, by promoting direct democracy, and by reducing the distortion of information.”
For Dr Heman Mohabeer, the impact of AI will be huge as it will bring unprecedented opportunities if we are able to fully harness it. “Mauritius is geographically well positioned to become a technological hub and an incubator for the sub-Saharan African region. The most important contribution that AI will bring is efficiency and transparency in the various sectors. AI will allow a much closer integration of the ‘human-technology’ relationship and will enable people to perform more efficiently. Contrary to speculations, new jobs will be created.”
Dr. Ramesh Caussy highlights that like in every country, AI will progressively modify the industries, markets, and the value chains. “This will give rise to players and change to positioning of the existing incumbent actors. Whether people like it or not, this means transformation and need to embrace this new technology and use case dissemination.”
Economic impact
Economist Dr Bhavish Jugurnath evokes fundamental economic issues. “AI creates a new way of thinking about technology, business development and strategic execution. Overall, we can expect to see a spike in the frequency, flexibility and immediacy of data analysis across industries and applications to drive business decisions.”
Prospects
Referring to the Budget 2018-2019, Dr Gukhool avers that the introduction of the Mauritius Artificial Intelligence Council will scale opportunities in this field. “The Government will be setting up a task force to develop a road map for Mauritius in order to measure the socio-economical impacts of the promotion of AI. It is also important to boost research with the aim to pioneer advance AI research in order to bring innovation and attract foreign investment.” The Senior Lecturer highlights that the formulation of an AI policy is mandatory to sustain an ethical and effective integration of AI in our local context.
Already, lots of opportunities are being created by the impact of AI across the world. Mauritius is no different, says Dr Heman Mohabeer. “There is a major scarcity in talents in the field of AI. If we manage to fit the right curriculum in our educational system, then the opportunities and impact will be big. Data scientist, Machine learning engineer are among the few job skills that will be required. Adoption of AI in different sectors will bring its fair share of contribution toward making those sectors more efficient. However, we need to invest heavily and start developing the relevant to avoid job mismatch once AI takes over the so called ‘traditional technologies’.”
Loganaden Velvindron recalls that it is an opportunity for a small country to make a major impact on the world map. “People are unaware that Mauritius has contributed to Internet Security already by working on new internet protocols such as TLS 1.3. Same can be done with AI if we have the right people, the right environment and the right business model. However, the private sector needs to work together with the public sector to retain our brains which will build those opportunities.”

Major contribution across sectors
From transport to finance, health, insurance or SMEs, AI will bring remarkable transformation in the short and long term. Some of the major contributions have been summarized as follows by experts.
Reduce road congestion
For the Senior Lecturer, the introduction of road sensors and cameras will be essential in the collection of data regarding traffic flow. He believes that machine learning can be useful to identify traffic patterns and anomalies, while complex algorithms may help in road decongestion. AI can be a crucial element in altering the behaviour of road users in view of mitigating road accidents.
Increase productivity  
Dr Oomesh Gukhool argues that the use of AI (Big data and Analytics) will optimise business processes and increase productivity. AI will improve the accuracy of product/service demand estimation, provide predictive maintenance, foster personalised manufacturing, and bring efficiency to product supply chains. AI will be beneficial to the agriculture sector since it will improve efficiency, for instance, using AI and image processing techniques to identify crop diseases and to monitor soil productivity
Dr. Ramesh Caussy argues that AI will bring more fluid coordination mechanisms of the country as well as the bureaucracy process. “It will also create new opportunity for the industrial and institutions to reduce costs and create new jobs. This is what Schumpeter called ‘the creative destruction’.”
Build smarter cities
The Senior Lecturer firmly believes AI will be able to learn how people use cities. “Data from ticket sales, tax information, police reports, sensors and cameras can be significantly important for pattern recognition. AI can count and track movement of vehicles as well as pedestrians, read license plates and recognise faces, in order to reduce drive time, improve security, and make better use of smart grids to streamline power and water usage in our cities.”
Improve the efficacy of the Government-to-Citizen system
AI will provide personalised services for the Government-to-Citizen system, thus reducing delays and effort required as well as scaling citizen satisfaction, says the Senior Lecturer. “Chatbots can be used as digital representatives for selective citizen services. Sentiment analysis can be helpful to better perceive citizen inquires and feedback.”
Position Mauritius as technological hub
Dr Heman Mohabeer believes that AI could help to make Mauritius a technological hub thereby solving various problems such as road infrastructure planning, smart health care system, intelligent crop farming. Just like currently AI is used to identify and predict which crops to adopt based on climatic condition change in Australia.

Employment cut off : Myth or reality?
One of the major fears is job cut off, which has been predicted by various experts. What could be the situation in Mauritius? Dr Bhavish Jugurnath argues that there is a possibility of a new era that could improve the lives of people. “One of the biggest concerns regarding AI is that it will replace human labour. 9% of all jobs are indeed at high risk of being automated. However, a new set of personnel will be required to build, maintain, operate and regulate emerging technologies linked to AI and to help people learn to work with them. Therefore, there is a resistance from employees and decision-makers to adopt a technology that might end up replacing their co-workers. The overall impact of AI in jobs is highly controversial today. A recent study launched by the World Economic Forum predicts that AI will destroy 5 million jobs in 15 major developed and emerging countries. However, industry leaders such as Microsoft, IBM and Salesforce affirm the opposite, that the use of AI in businesses will instead create qualified jobs.”
The Economist recalls that AI needs to be explored for the value it brings to specific business functions rather than for a need for novelty. “Skills scarcity is a major constraint on the adoption of AI. All economic sectors are facing the need to adapt their workforce’s skill sets. At stake is their ability to support and complement the AI-powered user experience. To do so, companies have two options: they can either hire external talents or they can rely on their own resources. The first obstacle here is the general shortage of digital talents and data scientists in Mauritius. Companies therefore need to upskill and retrain their own human resources, which is a complex and costly process.”
For Dr Heman Mohabeer, there is more of a myth than a fact when it comes to loss of jobs. “The reality is that there will be job displacement rather than job loss. Indeed, people will need to work smarter as they will be assisted by AI. In fact, more opportunities will be created rather than losses. As at now, the best AI works using supervised learning, meaning that it must be instructed on how to perform. We are a long way (probably at least one hundred years if technology revolves in the similar trend) to achieve completely autonomous machine capable of reasoning without the assistance of human being.”
Dr. Ramesh Caussy argues that there will be cut offs but there will also be new opportunities and people, organization, society, again need to work on their abilities to adapt to the new needs. “This is a kind of Darwinian technological evolution.”
For Loganaden Velvindron, AI will assist people more in their work rather than replacing them. “There are still cases where AI can fail. Many of those AI systems have failures, so you still need a human being to check on them.”

Artificial intelligence salaries benefit from the perfect recipe for a sweet paycheck: a hot field and high demand for scarce talent. It’s the ever-reliable law of supply and demand, and right now, anything artificial intelligence-related is in very high demand.
According to Indeed.com, the average IT salary — the keyword is “artificial intelligence engineer” — in the San Francisco area ranges from approximately $134,135 per year for “software engineer” to $169,930 per year for “machine learning engineer.”
However, it can go much higher if you have the credentials firms need. One tenured professor was offered triple his $180,000 salary to join Google, which he declined for a different teaching position.
However, the record, so far, was set in April when the Japanese firm Start Today, which operates the fashion-shopping site Zozotown, posted new job offerings for seven “genius” AI tech experts, offering annual salaries of as much as 100 million yen, or just under $1 million.
