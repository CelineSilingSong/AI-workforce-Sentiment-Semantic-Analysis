Job searching is hard.

It is hard on the nerves.


It is hard because you might linger in limbo for weeks or months at a time. It is hard due to wanting to ensure that every move you make will be the right one. There is that constantly looming fear that you might overstep and lose that prized job of a lifetime. Or you might inadvertently fail to take a step that would have landed the dream job you’ve been seeking nearly forever.

What can you do to boost your job search prowess?

A nowadays emerging answer is that you can use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to come to your job searching aid.
PROMOTED
For those of you that want AI to take care of the entire hassle and agonizing ordeal of a job search, I’m sorry to say that this is not yet in the cards. That being said, do keep your hopes up about what AI can remarkably accomplish in this context. Judicious use of AI can potentially make the job search a bit easier and serve as a sidekick to guide and encourage you during the dark days tolling away in the muddy job-hunting trenches.
AI won’t be a cure-all in this quest. Nor will the AI opt to do the job that you ultimately land, though you should expect that most modern-day jobs will inevitably require some AI usage once you are seated in the role and performing the work at hand. One way or another, AI is entering into all manner of job activities. Might as well use AI to find a job too.

Hopefully, I’ve now got your attention.
There is a particular type of AI known as Generative AI that is especially suitable for aiding a job search. Perhaps you’ve heard about or seen blaring headlines about an AI app known as ChatGPT. This social media darling of generative AI has garnered incredible press. I assure you that ChatGPT does not walk on water. One thing it can do is help throughout the perils and pitfalls of doing job searches.

In today’s column, I will be addressing the specific ways in which you can use generative AI for conducting a prudent and successful job search. I’ll be providing examples based on the use of ChatGPT, but please realize there are other generative AI apps that you can use instead. ChatGPT is admittedly the 600-pound gorilla right now of generative AI. Nonetheless, there are other similar generative AI apps that you can use in the same way and accomplish the same outcomes.

Meanwhile, you might be wondering what in fact generative AI is.
Let’s first cover the fundamentals of generative AI and then we can take a close look at leveraging the various features for job-hunting journeys.
Into all of this comes a slew of AI Ethics and AI Law considerations.
Please be aware that there are ongoing efforts to imbue Ethical AI principles into the development and fielding of AI apps. A growing contingent of concerned and erstwhile AI ethicists are trying to ensure that efforts to devise and adopt AI takes into account a view of doing AI For Good and averting AI For Bad. Likewise, there are proposed new AI laws that are being bandied around as potential solutions to keep AI endeavors from going amok on human rights and the like. For my ongoing and extensive coverage of AI Ethics and AI Law, see the link here and the link here, just to name a few.
The development and promulgation of Ethical AI precepts are being pursued to hopefully prevent society from falling into a myriad of AI-inducing traps. For my coverage of the UN AI Ethics principles as devised and supported by nearly 200 countries via the efforts of UNESCO, see the link here. In a similar vein, new AI laws are being explored to try and keep AI on an even keel. One of the latest takes consists of a set of proposed AI Bill of Rights that the U.S. White House recently released to identify human rights in an age of AI, see the link here. It takes a village to keep AI and AI developers on a rightful path and deter the purposeful or accidental underhanded efforts that might undercut society.
I’ll be interweaving AI Ethics and AI Law related considerations into this discussion.
Fundamentals Of Generative AI
The most widely known instance of generative AI is represented by an AI app named ChatGPT. ChatGPT sprung into the public consciousness back in November when it was released by the AI research firm OpenAI. Ever since ChatGPT has garnered outsized headlines and astonishingly exceeded its allotted fifteen minutes of fame.
I’m guessing you’ve probably heard of ChatGPT or maybe even know someone that has used it.
ChatGPT is considered a generative AI application because it takes as input some text from a user and then generates or produces an output that consists of an essay. The AI is a text-to-text generator, though I describe the AI as being a text-to-essay generator since that more readily clarifies what it is commonly used for. You can use generative AI to compose lengthy compositions or you can get it to proffer rather short pithy comments. It’s all at your bidding.
All you need to do is enter a prompt and the AI app will generate for you an essay that attempts to respond to your prompt. The composed text will seem as though the essay was written by the human hand and mind. If you were to enter a prompt that said “Tell me about Abraham Lincoln” the generative AI will provide you with an essay about Lincoln. There are other modes of generative AI, such as text-to-art and text-to-video. I’ll be focusing herein on the text-to-text variation.
Your first thought might be that this generative capability does not seem like such a big deal in terms of producing essays. You can easily do an online search of the Internet and readily find tons and tons of essays about President Lincoln. The kicker in the case of generative AI is that the generated essay is relatively unique and provides an original composition rather than a copycat. If you were to try and find the AI-produced essay online someplace, you would be unlikely to discover it.
Generative AI is pre-trained and makes use of a complex mathematical and computational formulation that has been set up by examining patterns in written words and stories across the web. As a result of examining thousands and millions of written passages, the AI can spew out new essays and stories that are a mishmash of what was found. By adding in various probabilistic functionality, the resulting text is pretty much unique in comparison to what has been used in the training set.
There are numerous concerns about generative AI.
One crucial downside is that the essays produced by a generative-based AI app can have various falsehoods embedded, including manifestly untrue facts, facts that are misleadingly portrayed, and apparent facts that are entirely fabricated. Those fabricated aspects are often referred to as a form of AI hallucinations, a catchphrase that I disfavor but lamentedly seems to be gaining popular traction anyway (for my detailed explanation about why this is lousy and unsuitable terminology, see my coverage at the link here).
Another concern is that humans can readily take credit for a generative AI-produced essay, despite not having composed the essay themselves. You might have heard that teachers and schools are quite concerned about the emergence of generative AI apps. Students can potentially use generative AI to write their assigned essays. If a student claims that an essay was written by their own hand, there is little chance of the teacher being able to discern whether it was instead forged by generative AI. For my analysis of this student and teacher confounding facet, see my coverage at the link here and the link here.
There have been some zany outsized claims on social media about Generative AI asserting that this latest version of AI is in fact sentient AI (nope, they are wrong!). Those in AI Ethics and AI Law are notably worried about this burgeoning trend of outstretched claims. You might politely say that some people are overstating what today’s AI can actually do. They assume that AI has capabilities that we haven’t yet been able to achieve. That’s unfortunate. Worse still, they can allow themselves and others to get into dire situations because of an assumption that the AI will be sentient or human-like in being able to take action.
Do not anthropomorphize AI.
Doing so will get you caught in a sticky and dour reliance trap of expecting the AI to do things it is unable to perform. With that being said, the latest in generative AI is relatively impressive for what it can do. Be aware though that there are significant limitations that you ought to continually keep in mind when using any generative AI app.
One final forewarning for now.
Whatever you see or read in a generative AI response that seems to be conveyed as purely factual (dates, places, people, etc.), make sure to remain skeptical and be willing to double-check what you see.
Yes, dates can be concocted, places can be made up, and elements that we usually expect to be above reproach are all subject to suspicions. Do not believe what you read and keep a skeptical eye when examining any generative AI essays or outputs. If a generative AI app tells you that Abraham Lincoln flew around the country in his private jet, you would undoubtedly know that this is malarky. Unfortunately, some people might not realize that jets weren’t around in his day, or they might know but fail to notice that the essay makes this brazen and outrageously false claim.
A strong dose of healthy skepticism and a persistent mindset of disbelief will be your best asset when using generative AI.
We are ready to move into the next stage of this elucidation.
Crucial Ways To Use Generative AI For Job Searching
Now that you have a semblance of what generative AI is, we can explore the particulars of trying to use the core features of such AI for doing job searches.
Here’s my handy-dandy list of the twelve ways that you can use generative AI such as ChatGPT to undertake a sensible and productive job search:


1) Aid in identifying and assessing your job search strategies
2) Serve as your sidekick job search coach
3) Bolster your social media job-searching positioning
4) Boost your daily spirit to keep in the job search game
5) Prepare your resume
6) Review and revise your resume
7) Find and analyze prospective employers
8) Get you ready for those daunting interviews
9) Provide feedback as to how your interviews went
10) Do an assessment of job offers
11) Guide your job offer negotiations
12) Get you ready for future job searches


There are additional ways that you can use generative AI in this somber endeavor, so do keep your eyes wide open for further means of using AI in this capacity. I’ve opted to focus your attention on these dozen keystone methods. Once you’ve tried using generative AI for these notable approaches, I’m sure you’ll readily come up with even more ways to do so.
I’ll cover each one of the generative AI uses, step by step.
Along the way, I will also be pointing out important caveats and limitations. Anybody that blindly tries to use an AI app to aid in their job search is asking for trouble. You cannot let AI take over your efforts. You are in charge. As mentioned earlier, the chances are that generative AI will produce errors, falsehoods, and other maladies when composing the outputted essays. You need to be diligent and catch any such unsavoriness.
Some wonder whether they can use AI as a convenient excuse or fall guy when making a faux pas as a job seeker.
Here’s what I mean.
You put together your resume. It looks perfect. You send the resume to a prospective employer. Upon seeing the resume, they let you know that there were flagrant errors in your resume, such as names or dates that don’t jibe. Because of the found errors, you are summarily out of luck about pursuing this particular job. The expectation by the prospective employer was that you would carefully and thoroughly scrutinize your resume before sending it in. Anyone that lacks that kind of care is not someone they want to hire.
One immediate hunch would be that maybe you can blame AI for the mistakes made. This might get you off the hook. It might also get you back into the game with this potential employer.
You let them know that you had used a generative AI app to aid in crafting your resume. Regrettably, and as we all know, these AI apps are prone to making mistakes (that’s your outstretched plea). You thank them for finding the errors. You submit a new version that you assure them was redone, by hand, and now has completely corrected the prior faults.
Will this get a second look and a fresh start?
Let’s address the AI Ethics considerations.
First, suppose that you didn’t actually use any AI app at all and instead the resume was done entirely by you. You are now lying that the AI made the missteps. One supposes that if the prospective employer found out you have lied, they would almost certainly ditch your application right away. The odds though that they would ascertain that you lied is rather low, such that even those proclaimed detection tools that will determine whether something is written by human hand versus AI are generally unreliable and not to be depended upon, see my extensive analysis of the link here.
Second, imagine that you did use a generative AI app. Your attempt to shift blame to the AI is obviously rather weak. You should have reviewed and corrected any mistakes. The resume that you submitted is entirely on your shoulders. Trying to shift blame to AI is seemingly unseemly. One supposes that you might get a prospective employer to buy into the contention, but it still makes you out to be lacking in thoroughness and diligence.
The upshot is that you will need to check and double-check anything that you get as output from generative AI. Be very mindful of what you opt to use. Don’t fall into the easy trap of assuming that the materials produced by generative AI will be of the highest and perfect quality. They won’t be. Sometimes you’ll get content that is right on, while in other cases you might get askew content that subtly undermines your pursuits. The instances of wild and wacky outputs are usually easily noted and corrected.
Here's another sobering consideration for you.
Do you need to inform a prospective employer that you are using generative AI as part of your job search activities?
Once again, we have entered into the AI Ethics realm.
Some would say that yes, you should inform a prospective hiring firm that you have used AI to aid in your job search, assuming that you indeed are doing so. This might be done in a cover letter or indicated directly on your resume. This tells the company that you are honest and aboveboard. There might also be a side tangent benefit that it makes you look state-of-the-art and that you understand how to make use of AI.
Hogwash, the retort goes. There is absolutely no need to tell anyone that you are using AI in your job search. It is none of their business. You might have used a friend or hired a human job search adviser, but you likely wouldn’t tout that, would you? Of course not. The AI is merely a behind-the-scenes aid. Don’t bring it up. If a prospective employer directly asks you whether you are using AI, well, in that case, be forthright. Only then does the issue arise. The odds are infinitesimal that you’ll be asked such a question.
You be the judge.
The gist is that you ought to anticipate and contemplate your posture associated with the use of generative AI in your job-hunting efforts.
Now then, I will be proffering some of the pros and cons associated with using generative AI for each of the twelve approaches that I’ve listed. It is generally up to you to decide what you are comfortable doing and to what degree you will reveal your AI usage.
The interesting twist is that your use of AI is not especially a considered legal issue per se as yet. Meanwhile, the use of AI by employers for hiring purposes is becoming a big deal. I’ve discussed how the government is mulling over potential regulations and legislation associated with using AI in the job hiring process. Indeed, especially at the forefront of this emerging high-priority matter is EEOC Commissioner, Keith Sonderling, see my coverage at the link here.
Let’s next proceed to explore each of the twelve ways that you can augment or amplify your job search via generative AI, including tips and insights associated with using ChatGPT in particular. Afterward, I’ll do a wrap-up and provide some final thoughts on the topic.
1) Aid in identifying and assessing your job search strategies
You can use generative AI such as ChatGPT to identify and assess your job-hunting strategies.
If you don’t have any particular strategy in mind, you can simply ask or tell ChatGPT to identify some useful approaches for you. This will usually be laid out in a series of bulleted points. You can then dive deeper into the mentioned considerations. Realize that this is all supposed to be done interactively. Do not treat this as though it is a one-and-done matter.
I mention the interactive aspects because your first reaction to seeing a set of job search strategies as generated by ChatGPT would likely be that this is no different than if you had done a generic Internet search on your own anyway. Though that is somewhat true, you have to realize that the beauty of using generative AI is that you can immediately interact with the app and take the conversation in a variety of directions. Doing so in a conventional Internet search engine is much harder and at times exceedingly frustrating (for my coverage of the emerging inclusion of generative AI such as ChatGPT and Bard into search engines, see the link here).
For those of you that already have a devised job search method, you can get ChatGPT to assess whatever approach you are using. You will need to do a cut-and-paste into the ChatGPT prompt to indicate what your job search strategy is. If you don’t have one written down and it exists solely in your noggin, now might be a good time to write it down. Seeing your thoughts on paper often spurs new ideas and gets you to see gotchas or loopholes that otherwise were not apparent.
Plus, once you’ve got it written, you can then give it to ChatGPT for review and assessment. And, of course, you can then get ChatGPT to further elaborate on the assessment and explain why things might be improved.
One thing I do want to warn you about. When you enter your prompts into generative AI, most of these packages are not considered private and there is no guarantee of confidentiality. The AI maker usually says that they can look at your prompts and use your prompts in various ways, presumably to enhance the AI, but this is widely interpretable and you can’t know for sure what will happen to your prompts. For my in-depth look at the qualms about data privacy and confidentiality associated with ChatGPT, see the link here.
I think we are now ready for an example of how ChatGPT can generate a job search strategy.
Let’s start with a generic prompt and see what we will get produced.
My Entered Prompt: “What are some really good job search strategies?”
ChatGPT Generated Response: 
“Here are some effective job search strategies that can help you find a job:”


“Identify your strengths and skills: Knowing what you're good at can help you target the right job opportunities that match your skills and interests.”
“Update your resume and cover letter: Ensure your resume and cover letter are up to date and tailored for each job application.”
“Network: Reach out to your professional network, including colleagues, friends, family, and former bosses, to ask for job leads or advice.”
“Use online job boards: Check job boards such as LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Indeed, Monster, and other job listing websites to find relevant job postings.”
“Attend job fairs and events: Attend job fairs, conferences, and industry events to meet potential employers, learn about job opportunities, and network with other professionals.”
“Consider temporary or freelance work: Consider taking on freelance work or temp jobs to build your skills and connections in your industry.”
“Utilize social media: Use social media platforms, such as LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook to connect with potential employers and industry professionals.”
“Prepare for job interviews: Research the company, review common interview questions, and practice your responses to increase your chances of acing the job interview.”


“Remember to be patient and persistent in your job search. It may take some time, but with the right strategy and effort, you'll find the job that's right for you.”
Analysis of Results
All in all, the generic response seems pretty good.
There might be some points made that you hadn’t yet been considering. Score a point or two for ChatGPT.
Next, let’s give ChatGPT some specifics. I will pretend that I am a mid-career professional that is currently employed as a senior software engineer. With all the tech company lays offs lately, let’s also tell ChatGPT that I was let go as an overall RIF (reduction in force). Perhaps the job search strategy generated will be more specific to this particular situation.
My Entered Prompt: “I am a mid-career professional that is a senior software engineer. I recently got laid off as did many of my fellow software developers. What are some useful job search strategies for me in particular based on my current career status.”
ChatGPT Generated Response:
“ChatGPT I'm sorry to hear about your recent layoff. Here are some job search strategies that may be particularly useful for mid-career professionals like yourself who have experience as a senior software engineer:”


“Leverage your professional network: Reach out to former colleagues, managers, clients, and acquaintances who work in your industry or related industries to let them know that you're looking for work. They may be able to refer you to job opportunities or offer advice.”
“Update your resume and online profiles: Update your resume and online profiles such as LinkedIn to highlight your skills and experience as a senior software engineer. Be sure to customize your resume for each job application.”
“Focus on companies with a strong technology focus: Research and target companies with a strong technology focus, such as tech startups, software development firms, and companies in the software development or IT industries.”
“Attend industry events and conferences: Attend industry events, conferences, and seminars to network with professionals in your industry, learn about the latest trends and technologies, and hear about job opportunities.”
“Consider contract work or freelancing: Consider taking on contract work or freelancing as a way to gain experience, build your skills, and expand your network in your industry.”
“Brush up on your skills: Consider taking online courses, attending workshops, or getting certifications to brush up on your skills and demonstrate your commitment to learning and staying up-to-date with the latest technology.”
“Prepare for interviews: Prepare for job interviews by researching the company, reviewing common interview questions, and practicing your responses. Be sure to highlight your experience as a senior software engineer and demonstrate how you can add value to the company.”


“Remember, finding a new job can be a challenging process, but with persistence and the right strategies, you'll be able to find the right job opportunity for your career.”
Analysis of Results
I would say that the job search strategy is now definitely more finely tuned to my briefly painted scenario.
That being said, some of it has a kind of templated feel to it. This is almost as though the phrase “senior software engineer” were merely inserted here and there into the text. This highlights that you will usually need to keep digging deeper and deeper to get particulars out of generative AI. In this case, I would tend to bore down on the points and ask for details.
We will somewhat do that in a moment.
To do so, let’s discuss the next of my listed ways to use generative AI for job searching, namely using generative AI as your job search coach.
2) Serve as your sidekick job search coach
Doing a job search can be a quite solitary activity. You might not have anyone on that you can readily bounce ideas off. Furthermore, you might tell someone about your woes and they could harshly exhort you to buckle up and stop whining. This might not be the kind of pick-me-up that you need.
You can use generative AI as your sidekick job search coach.
Throughout the job search ordeal, you can have available 24x7 the generative AI to aid in your hunting progress. Tell the AI whatever went wrong that day and see what the app has to say. Of course, do keep in mind my earlier emphasis that the prompts are not private and not necessarily confidential.
When I mention that you can use generative AI for coaching purposes, there is often an adverse reaction by those humans that do similar kinds of job search coaching activities as a service. They will sternly inform you that AI cannot do what they do. I’ll say this, they are right in many respects. I’ve said it once, I’ll say it again today’s AI is not sentient. Keep your expectations low accordingly.
Some people are turning to generative AI for mental health advice. This has its tradeoffs and I’ve discussed what to watch out for, see my coverage at the link here and the link here. Bottom-line is that do not become fixated on using generative AI. Use it for what it can usefully perform. It might be handy when used in combination with a human advisor, though that’s something to discuss with whomever you are engaging for human assistance on these matters.
Okay, with all those caveats, let’s see if we can get ChatGPT to help with a situation whereby I’ve done a job interview and it didn’t go well (this is my ongoing scenario that I crafted to illustrate what you can do with ChatGPT).
My Entered Prompt: “I just did an interview for a job as a software manager. I don't think the interview went well. I got a lot of tough questions about how I handled projects that were over budget or had other troubles. My answers were not well received. What specific advice can you give me about doing any follow-up with the interviewers? Also, what do you advise I do for other similar interviews in the future?”
ChatGPT Generated Response:
“I'm sorry to hear that your interview didn't go as well as you had hoped. Here are some specific tips for following up with the interviewers and preparing for future interviews:”


“Follow up with a thank you email: Regardless of how the interview went, it's always a good idea to follow up with a thank you email to the interviewer(s). This shows that you appreciate their time and are still interested in the position. In the email, you can also briefly address any concerns or questions that may have come up during the interview.”
“Request feedback: If you're open to it, you could also consider requesting feedback on your interview performance. This can help you understand areas where you can improve and be better prepared for future interviews.”
“Reflect on your interview performance: Take some time to reflect on your interview performance and consider what you could have done differently or better. Were there specific questions you struggled with, or areas where you felt less prepared? Use this experience as a learning opportunity and take steps to improve for future interviews.”
“Prepare for similar questions: It's common for interviews for management positions to include questions about how you have handled difficult situations or projects. Take some time to reflect on past experiences where you faced similar challenges and consider how you could have handled them differently or better. This will help you be better prepared for similar questions in future interviews.”
“Practice your responses: Once you have identified areas where you can improve, practice your responses to common interview questions with a friend or family member. This will help you feel more confident and prepared for your next interview.”


“Remember, job interviews can be challenging, and it's common to face difficult questions or scenarios. With practice and preparation, you can improve your interview skills and increase your chances of landing your dream job. Good luck!”

The reply seems helpful.
I might have been self-absorbed about my job search and not have thought of the points brought up by ChatGPT. In addition, it is handy to have the points as a collective set of bulleted items to be considered. You can turn those lists into a daily or weekly checklist and proceed accordingly.
One aspect that I don’t like about many of the existing generative AI packages is that they tend to use the word “I” in their outputted essays. This is a choice made by the AI developers. I don’t like it. The word “I” is usually reserved to refer to humans. Using the word “I” in the outputted essays makes the AI app seem to be human. Stop doing this.
I refer to this as anthropomorphizing by design, which is a foul practice.
Another aspect is the wording that says “I’m sorry to hear” which further falsely suggests that the AI app is a human. We expect apologies and words of sympathy to come from fellow humans. Using this type of wording in the AI app is ill-advised. I realize that it might seem nifty and the AI developers undoubtedly believe that this is a means of boosting the spirits of those using the package, but overall it is inappropriate, see my detailed discussion at the link here.
Enough on the ranting and raving, time to get into further ways to use generative AI for doing job searches.
3) Bolster your social media job-searching positioning
You would almost need to be living in a cave to not realize you can use social media for a job search.
Some people think about it, but do not do so because they are worried that there might be a stigma hovering over them by admitting they are looking for a job. This might have been the case long ago, but I don’t think it particularly applies in modern times.
Everyone nowadays realizes that anyone can end up between jobs.
The IBJ (in-between jobs) status can occur regardless of job performance or any other job-related element. Firms dump people all the time, and oftentimes for the ditziest of reasons.
In my experience, people usually rush to aid the person that says they are looking for a job. This is especially likely if you have been trying to do the same for others. I would urge you to do so. In essence, even when you aren’t looking for a job, go out of your way to help others that are looking. You can create goodwill and dividends that will be useful when you are in the same boat.
Assuming that you see the value in using social media for your job search, you should next be mindful of how you use social media for this vaunted purpose. The wrong types of messaging can potentially harm your job prospects. Plus, much of social media is permanent such that whatever you mistakenly or unwisely state will last forever.
You might be the type of person that has no clue what to say in social media posts when it comes to your job search ambitions. We can ask ChatGPT for some help.
Here we go.
My Entered Prompt: “I think it might be useful for me to make some postings on LinkedIn so that people will know who I am and know that I am looking for a job. I'm an experienced software developer. What kinds of LinkedIn postings should I do? Please provide an example of one that I might be able to post.”
ChatGPT Generated Response:
“Posting on LinkedIn is a great way to increase your visibility to potential employers and show them your expertise in your field. Here are some types of LinkedIn posts that can be effective for job seekers, along with an example post:”


“Sharing industry news and insights: Sharing industry news or insights related to your area of expertise can demonstrate your knowledge and show potential employers that you are up-to-date with the latest trends in your field. For example: ""Just read an interesting article on the latest trends in machine learning. As a software developer with a strong interest in AI, I found this piece to be particularly insightful. Looking forward to seeing how these trends develop in the coming years!""
“Showcasing your work: Sharing a project or piece of work that you've completed can be a great way to demonstrate your skills and provide examples of your abilities to potential employers. For example: ""Just finished up a new web development project for a client. Excited to share the final product - check it out here: [link to project]""
“Highlighting your skills and experience: Posting about your skills and experience can help potential employers get a better sense of what you bring to the table. For example: ""As an experienced software developer, I bring a strong background in Java, Python, and C++. I've worked on a variety of projects ranging from web development to machine learning, and I'm always looking to learn more and take on new challenges.""


“Remember to keep your posts professional, relevant to your field, and engaging to your audience. By consistently posting quality content, you'll increase your visibility and attract the attention of potential employers who are looking for candidates with your skills and experience.”
Analysis of Results
I like the suggestions.
Notice carefully that I prompted ChatGPT in a particular way. I could have simply asked for overall ideas about how to use social media. That would have probably gotten me some quite vanilla-flavored answers.
Instead, I referred to LinkedIn specifically. I mention this because the style of messaging would differ if I was using some other social media platform. If you try asking ChatGPT and do so by naming various platforms, the style of the examples will adjust per the platform atmosphere you are targeting.
I also asked for examples. Without asking or mentioning the desire to have examples, it is unlikely that the examples would have been generated. I can now take those examples, adjust them to fit my personal preference, and use them right away on LinkedIn.
4) Boost your daily spirit to keep in the job search game
Job searching will involve long low valleys and occasional high points. Sadly, the high points are typically rare. Amid the sparse and unforgiving dry landscape of job search despair, sometimes you need a shoulder to cry on.
Imagine that you were a finalist candidate for a job that you eagerly sought. You are waiting on pins and needles. It has to be you. They would be nutty to pick anyone else. The clock slowly ticks. What will happen? You have your lucky rabbit’s foot at the ready.
Yikes, you get the word that you were not picked. They went with someone else. It is most certainly a crime of the century.
Let’s see what ChatGPT can advise.
My Entered Prompt: “I am totally bummed out because I just found out that a job I really wanted has decided to instead hire someone else. It makes me want to give up my job search. Can you give me a pep talk and get my job search energies back up to where they belong?”
ChatGPT Generated Response:
“I'm sorry to hear that you didn't get the job you really wanted. It's completely normal to feel disappointed and discouraged when things don't go as planned. However, it's important to remember that rejection is a normal part of the job search process, and it doesn't define your worth or abilities as a job candidate. Here are a few reasons why you should keep your job search energies up:”


“Every interview is a learning experience: Every interview you have is an opportunity to learn and grow as a job candidate. Take note of the questions that were asked and the areas where you could improve. Use this information to refine your interview skills and be better prepared for future opportunities.”
“The right job is still out there: Just because you didn't get the job you wanted doesn't mean that there aren't other opportunities out there for you. Keep looking and applying for jobs that align with your interests, skills, and experience.”
“Don't give up on your dreams: If you're feeling discouraged, remember the reasons why you started your job search in the first place. Don't let one setback deter you from pursuing your dreams and career goals.”
“You're not alone: Many people experience setbacks in their job search, especially in the current job market. Remember that you're not alone, and don't be afraid to reach out to friends, family, or career counselors for support.”
“Celebrate small wins: Celebrate the small victories along the way, such as a successful interview or a new contact made. These moments can help keep you motivated and energized for your job search.”


“Remember to be kind to yourself, stay focused on your goals, and keep pushing forward. Your dream job is out there, and with persistence and determination, you will find it.”
Analysis of Results
I realize that almost no semblance of words can overcome your initial shock and anguish about not winning a job that you thought you had a solid chance of getting. Go for a walk in some pleasant outdoors wooded area to clear your mind. Enjoy the fresh air and blue skies. Avoid bears.
Once you’ve come back to your everyday senses, I think that you would see that the ChatGPT-generated essay makes some excellent points. As always, you can dig deeper into the points by simply asking the AI app to provide additional details.
5) Prepare your resume
Nearly everyone that considers using generative AI for a job search is almost immediately going to think about doing so for the crafting of their resume. It has to be the topmost use when applied to job hunting (well, I haven’t seen any statistics on this, just my guess).
There isn’t any magic involved, so keep that in mind.
I say this because some people seem to be under the false and zany impression that a generative AI app can produce a resume for them out of thin air. Nonsense. There is no mind-reading involved in today’s AI. You will have to provide your specific details in a prompt or series of prompts. The AI app can then compose a resume for you.
Make sure to indicate that you are seeking to produce a resume. Most generative AI apps can produce a resume in a variety of resume-specific formats. You might not like the format chosen. Ask it to try something else, and give clues about what you want. In the end, you still might not like the format.
No problem, just grab the produced text and plop it into a resume format of your choosing. The good news is that you now hopefully have the hardest part done, namely the wording that is going to be in the resume.
One big gotcha looms over this.
The wording produced by a generative AI app might contain errors, falsehoods, and those annoying and disconcerting AI hallucinations. You would be foolish to accept outright whatever the AI app generated. Make sure to refine and make the resume sensible, else you might be handing out a resume that will create dismay and disgust, rather than delight and interest.
6) Review and revise your resume
Continuing on the discussion about using generative AI for building resumes, you can take a slightly different approach on the resume front.
Feed your resume into a generative AI app. Ask the AI to review the resume. Based on the suggested changes, make changes as you see fit. You can also ask the AI app to make changes directly, either in lieu of doing a review or in addition to providing a review.
I’ll once again remind you that anything you enter into the AI app is not specially considered private or confidential. If you are okay with your resume being potentially absorbed into the Borg, please proceed. One trick would be to first remove any considered personal info such as your phone number, address, or other such content, and then feed that version into the AI app for review and refinement.
You can add back the personal stuff and then send out that as your finalized resume.
7) Find and analyze prospective employers
By now, I assume you are getting my drift about how to use generative AI for job searching.
I’ll pick up the pace.
You can potentially use generative AI to find prospective employers. In terms of finding jobs, realize that some of the generative AI apps are not tied to the Internet on any real-time basis. For example, ChatGPT was frozen at the end of 2021. Thus, asking the AI app to find open jobs is futile.
I am suggesting instead that you can get some background info about companies via using generative AI, albeit it might be outdated. You’ll probably want to use a conventional search engine or one that happens to have generative AI connected to it.
One thing you can consider doing is taking the otherwise found text about a company and feeding that into a generative AI prompt. If you do this in conjunction with a generative AI conversation that has included particulars about you and your situation, it is feasible to get the AI to comment on how you and that firm might seem to get along with each other.
I mention this because one of the most often asked questions of candidates is why they picked a specific employer as a potential place to work. Generative AI can help you come up with some dazzling reasons, assuming you don’t already have dazzling reasons of your own.
8) Get you ready for those daunting interviews
Here is where the interactive conversational aspects can shine.
You can potentially do a practice round of what an interview will be like. Tell the generative AI to pretend it is a hiring manager. Be as descriptive about the role as you can. You can then tell the AI app to engage in a conversation with you as though you were being interviewed.
On top of that, ask the AI to provide remarks or commentary about your answers. Be forewarned that this might be somewhat painful since the AI is bound to proffer some unabashed knockdown indications. My viewpoint is that I would rather have the AI throw me for a loop in comparison to making a potential job-losing answer during an interview with a human.
There is an added twist that few think about.
Firms today are increasingly using AI to conduct initial rounds of interviews. They use specialized chatbots to interview you. If you haven’t done this yet, I assure you that it will be quite irritating and exasperating. Getting turned down by a human interviewer is bad enough while having a chatbot do so is beyond the bounds of humanity.
Anyway, it is what it is.
You might as well try to get used to this trend. Use your generative AI that you have ready access to use and for which there is no worry about saying the wrong thing.
How do you get a job at Carnegie Hall?
Practice, practice, practice.
9) Provide feedback as to how your interviews went
You went on an interview. It was with a fellow human.
Time to do a review and see what lessons can be learned. The old line in the job search realm is that each job interview is a practice round that is getting you one step closer to the interview that lands you that dream job.
It is advisable to make notes after an interview, doing so while the interview is fresh in your mind. You can also use those notes to feed into a generative AI app and ask the AI to provide a critique or commentary about the interview.
Suppose that during an interview, you get asked a question or are told something that you think seems unfair or inappropriate. Let’s see what ChatGPT has to say about this.
My Entered Prompt: “I got done with an interview for a software engineering job and the interviewer told me that I am too old for the job. They are looking for someone younger than me. Can they do this? Is there anything I can do about this?”
ChatGPT Generated Response: 
“It is illegal for an employer to discriminate against a job candidate based on their age. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) prohibits employment discrimination against individuals who are 40 years of age or older. If you believe that you have been discriminated against based on your age, you may have grounds to file a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).”
“Before taking any legal action, however, you may want to consider reaching out to the company's human resources department or to the interviewer to express your concerns and seek clarification on their hiring practices. It's possible that the interviewer's comment was a mistake or a miscommunication, and they may be willing to reconsider your candidacy.”
“If you do decide to file a complaint with the EEOC, you will need to provide evidence that the employer discriminated against you based on your age. This may include the interviewer's comment, as well as any other evidence that suggests that age was a factor in the employer's hiring decision.”
“It's important to remember that job discrimination can be difficult to prove, and it's possible that you may not be able to obtain the job even if you file a complaint. However, it's important to stand up for your rights and to advocate for fair and equal treatment in the workplace.”
Analysis of Results
Obviously, do not take any form of legal advice from an AI app (maybe in the future, see my coverage on this topic at the link here).
The gist though is that if you were harboring suspicions about what went down during the interview, at least this can give you further food for thought. Take action as you think warranted.
10) Do an assessment of job offers
You have gotten a job offer. Congratulations! Turns out that your luck has gone way off the charts and you get a second job offer at the same time.
Probably wise to go buy a lottery ticket. You are hot.
Let’s see what ChatGPT can help us with in the lucky situation of having to select from two competing job offers.
My Entered Prompt: “I am very happy that I have two job offers in hand. They are both great. One of the jobs is focused on software development, while the other job is aimed at managing software projects. The pay is about the same for both companies. The software development job allows me to work from home. The software projects management job will require me to go into the office. Which of the two jobs should I pick?”
ChatGPT Generated Response:
“Congratulations on having two job offers in hand! This is a great position to be in, but it can also be a tough decision to make. Here are some factors to consider when deciding between the two job offers:”


“Your career goals: Think about your long-term career goals and which job offer aligns better with those goals. If you're looking to advance your career in software development, the software development job may be the better choice. If you're interested in project management or leadership roles, the software projects management job may be the better fit.”
“Your work preferences: Consider your work style and preferences. Do you prefer working from home or going into the office? If you value the flexibility and convenience of working from home, the software development job may be the better fit. If you enjoy working in an office environment and collaborating with others in person, the software projects management job may be a better fit.”
“Job responsibilities: Take a close look at the job responsibilities for each position. Which job offers responsibilities that align with your interests and strengths? Consider which job will challenge you and help you grow in your career.”
“Company culture: Consider the company culture and values of each company. Do they align with your own values and work style? Think about which company you can see yourself being happy and successful at long-term.”
“Career growth opportunities: Consider the growth opportunities offered by each company. Which company offers better opportunities for professional development, promotions, and growth within the company?”


“Take some time to weigh these factors carefully and think about which job offer is the best fit for you and your career goals. Ultimately, the decision is yours, and it's important to choose the job that feels like the best fit for your needs and interests. Good luck with your decision!”
Analysis of Results
The comments seem useful.
You can dig into them further, as desired.
I suppose you should be relieved that the AI didn’t ask for a piece of the action and try to get a fee from you for providing the job dilemma choosing advice.
11) Guide your job offer negotiations
At the point of negotiating for a job, keep generative AI in your front pocket to help with this too.
Some people use generative AI for the preceding uses, and neglect to consider the available use when dealing with job offers. Maybe you don’t want the AI to advise on such matters. That’s fine. At least give it some thought.
I will keep reminding you that you don’t want any private or confidential info to be given to most of the generative AI apps. The same applies in the case of a job offer. Also, for AI that is frozen in time, trying to ask for comparisons of your compensation to what the market will bear is not going to be helpful. You will be comparing yesterday’s apples with today’s oranges.
12) Get you ready for future job searches
There is a legendary piece of wisdom about job searching that is worth knowing. Let me share it with you. It is usually phrased as a question.
Prepare yourself.
A lofty question is posed: When should you be doing a job search?
The correct answer is always.
Yes, you should always be doing a job search. Some people wait until they are standing outside of a firm and wondering what happened to them. Nope, that’s not when you should be starting your job search.
Your entire career should be one ongoing job search.
That being the case, this does not mean that you toss into the face of your current employer that you are looking for a job. That’s impolite and you are asking for trouble. Your job search will flow with the times. When fully employed, put your job search on low. Upon flopping onto the open market, shift into high.
Meanwhile, the job search has been never-ending.
You can use generative AI on an ongoing basis for keeping your job search underway. Periodically bring up job search topics with the generative AI. Get it to be your reminder of what you should be doing. You can do the same by making marks in your diary, plus using the AI to aid you in your job quest too.
Conclusion
Allow me to clarify a vital point about all of this.
Some will misinterpret this discussion and try to make it seem that generative AI is the cat’s meow when doing a job search. Drop all other avenues of your job search efforts and solely hole up with your laptop or smartphone and use generative AI, that’s what some will disingenuously contend is being said here.
Not so.
In the vast arsenal of how to conduct your job search, generative AI is only one tool. For those of you that didn’t even know it was such a tool, I am glad that you now know of it. For those of you who maybe sort of knew, I hope that this elaboration has shown you additional ways to leverage generative AI.
If you think that generative AI will be a waste of time for your job searching, that’s perfectly fine, as long as you at least realized what can be done and judged mindfully that it would not be of value to you. Go forth and I wish you the best in your job search pursuits.
When I advise people about job searching, I tell them that they should consider all reasonable avenues and choose what works best for them. Generative AI might not be your cup of tea. For some, it might be. In any case, a balanced portfolio of job search resources and approaches is the blend that you want to attain.
A final word for now.
Thomas Jefferson said this inspiring witticism: “I’m a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work, the more I have of it.”
Some people claim that landing a desired job is entirely dependent on luck. I’d prefer to believe as Thomas Jefferson so eloquently stated, namely that you can indeed believe in luck, though at the same time be pursuing with all the gusto and mindfulness you can muster.
Maybe generative AI fits into that empowering equation, one way or another.

Category: AIFebruary 17, 2023 What is Microsoft’s approach to AI?














At Microsoft, we believe artificial intelligence (AI) is the defining technology of our time.
We have been on the forefront of cutting-edge research in AI and integrating these powerful, innovative AI technologies into our products and services to help customers do more. Microsoft AI, powered by Azure, provides billions of intelligent experiences every day in Windows, Xbox, Microsoft 365, Teams, Azure AI, Power Platform, Dynamics 365 and Microsoft Defender.
Our AI tools and technologies are designed to benefit everyone at every level in every organization. They are used in workplaces, home offices, academic institutions, research labs and manufacturing facilities around the world, and they are helping everyone from scientists and salespeople to farmers, software developers and security practitioners.
We have made huge investments in AI because we are optimistic about what it can do to help people, industry and society, and because we’re committed to bringing technology and people together to realize the promises of AI responsibly.

Our approach to using AI responsibly 
Microsoft believes that when you create powerful technologies, you also must ensure that the technology is developed and used responsibly. We are committed to a practice of responsible AI by design, guided by a core set of principles: fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency and accountability.
Microsoft is putting these principles into practice across the company to develop and deploy AI that will have a positive impact on society.
“With the right guardrails, cutting-edge technology can be safely introduced to the world to help people be more productive and go on to solve some of our most pressing societal problems,” says Natasha Crampton, the chief responsible AI officer at Microsoft.
AI systems are the product of many different decisions made by those who develop and deploy them. From system purpose to how people interact with AI systems, we need to guide these decisions toward beneficial and equitable outcomes.
“That’s what our practice of responsible AI by design is all about,” Crampton says. “We ensure that responsible AI considerations are addressed at the earliest stages of system design and then throughout the whole lifecycle, so that the appropriate controls and mitigations are baked into the system being built, not bolted on at the end.”
This approach does not eliminate all risks, and a commitment to listening, learning and improving is paramount. But it does encourage developers to be clear about any limitations, account for intended uses and potential misuses, and think expansively about how to secure the benefits of a system and guard against its risks.
We believe proactive, self-regulatory efforts by responsible companies help pave the way for these new laws, but we recognize that not all organizations will adopt responsible practices voluntarily.
Microsoft President, Brad Smith, recently outlined the importance of the company stepping up to meet the current AI moment, including calling for thoughtful policy.
“Countries and communities will need to use democratic law-making processes to engage in whole-of-society conversations about where the lines should be drawn to ensure that people have protection under the law,” Smith wrote.
“Effective AI regulations should center on the highest risk applications and be outcomes-focused and durable in the face of rapidly advancing technologies and changing societal expectations. To spread the benefits of AI as broadly as possible, regulatory approaches around the globe will need to be interoperable and adaptive, just like AI itself,” he added.
Microsoft believes democratic, law-making processes are a vital part of a global dialogue with industry, academia and civil society to create principled and actionable norms that ensure organizations develop and deploy AI responsibly.
As part of this process, we are committed to publicly sharing the company’s learnings and best practices, along with the tools that guide our efforts. This includes our Responsible AI Standard, a framework for translating our high-level principles into actionable guidance for our engineering teams.
Like all transformative technologies, we are aware that AI has its risks. Some people will use this technology to exploit the flaws in human nature, target people with false information, undermine democracy and cause harm. We need to plan for and mitigate these risks.
Microsoft has been working on its cross-company, cross-discipline, responsible AI effort for more than six years, creating a strong foundation upon which to keep building for the future. We are clear-eyed about the need to continue moving forward with urgency to keep pace with the rapid evolution of technology and changing societal expectations.
“Fundamentally, our AI work is grounded in our company mission to help every person and organization on the planet to achieve more,” says Crampton, “and it is undergirded by our steadfast commitment to the responsible development and use of AI.”

Our approach to AI research
For more than 30 years, Microsoft Research has been advancing the foundations of computing and translating new scientific understanding into innovative technologies to create value for our customers and broad benefit to society.  
Our researchers collaborate across disciplines, institutions and geographies to deliver cutting-edge advances in vision, speech, language, decision-making and machine learning. They have pioneered AI breakthroughs in conversational speech recognition, machine translation, image captioning, natural language understanding and commonsense question answering. 
Recent efforts have focused on developing large-scale models that can process information in increasingly sophisticated ways while also becoming more natural and intuitive to use. Advances in deep learning, coupled with internet-scale datasets and Microsoft Azure’s increasingly powerful AI supercomputing resources, have made it possible to create AI models that perform a broad range of tasks across many different applications.   
“Large-scale AI is shifting the landscape of computing research,” says Ashley Llorens, vice president and managing director at Microsoft Research. “As we orient around that shift, you’ll see new frontiers that advance our understanding of human and machine intelligence and how they can intersect and reinforce each other in profound new ways.” 
Our research has played a key role in evolving model architectures and creating AI technology that is more efficient and more adaptable across an even broader range of tasks.
Microsoft researchers have been working on these problems for years, developing expertise in areas like parallel computation that allows people to more quickly train machine learning models at unprecedented scale. This has led to innovations like DeepSpeed, an open-source, deep learning optimization library for distributed training that was developed by Microsoft Research and now is used by the broader computing community.  
We also are focused on delivering value and solving real-world problems through Microsoft products and services. Project FarmVibes, for example, merges AI and data to offer open-source tools that can help farmers adopt sustainable agriculture practices. And the Microsoft Climate Research Initiative provides our research and computing capabilities to a team of multidisciplinary scientists working together to address climate change.   
Our new AI4Science organization is focused on applying deep learning to the natural sciences to model and predict natural phenomena and help address critical issues such as climate change, green energy and pharmaceutical discovery. Our project teams, which include a global collective of researchers and engineers, are exploring a new approach to machine learning, generating training data by simulating natural phenomena from fundamental equations rather than using datasets from the internet.   
This could enable researchers to understand and predict natural phenomena at scales ranging from quantum to galactic and, in turn, drive breakthroughs such as the discovery of new materials that can remove carbon from the atmosphere, Llorens says.    
“At the end of the day, we’re focused on pushing the frontiers in ways that enhance the human experience and positively impact society as a whole,” he says.   
“To achieve this, we’ll need to engage as part of the global research community and continually challenge our assumptions about what is possible. That’s what will produce the future advancements we need.”   
Our approach to AI infrastructure 
With growing confidence in AI and businesses aiming to do more with less, customers are looking for a trusted partner to streamline adoption and rapidly apply intelligence across workloads to improve operations, drive efficiencies and reduce costs. More than a decade ago, we forecast this exponential growth in demand for AI systems and started to build special computing infrastructure to handle it.   
Today, Microsoft’s AI platform, Azure AI, offers infrastructure optimized and purposely built for running large AI models that are ushering in a new era of productivity and creativity. Thanks to our investments, we’re able to deliver a wide range of AI-powered products that fit the needs of our customers and also deliver best-in-class performance and scale for the most compute-intensive AI training and inference workloads.   
Our unique architecture design combines the fastest graphics processing units, or GPUs, available in the market along with a network architecture that chains together thousands of GPUs to enable AI model training and inference at scale.  
“Having thousands of GPUs with high-bandwidth interconnect enables everything else from there,” says Eric Boyd, Microsoft corporate vice president for AI Platform.  
Organizations large and small are developing Azure AI solutions because they can achieve more at scale, more easily, with the proper enterprise-level privacy, security and responsible AI protections that Azure offers.  
We have committed to building Azure into an AI supercomputer for the world, serving as the foundation of our vision to democratize AI as a platform. Microsoft pushed the frontier of cloud supercomputing technology, announcing our first top-5 supercomputer in 2020, and subsequently constructing multiple AI supercomputing systems at massive scale.  
 We also fine-tuned our purpose-built, AI-optimized infrastructure capability in partnership with OpenAI to train and deploy OpenAI’s family of models for research advancement and developer production. This infrastructure is now available to all Azure customers.  
“When other people come to us, we can literally give them the same style of infrastructure that we used for OpenAI, because that’s now the standard way that we do it,” Boyd says.  
Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI Service provides businesses and developers with high-performance AI models, such as GPT-3.5, Codex and DALL∙E 2, at production scale with industry-leading uptime. This is the same production service we use to power AI models in our own products, including GitHub Copilot, Power Platform, and the recently announced Microsoft Designer and AI-powered search in Bing and Edge.
We continue to evolve our AI infrastructure based on feedback and insights from training and serving AI models at scale. Our teams work in lockstep with industry partners on the design of GPUs, networks and datacenters that are optimized for AI workloads.   
“Microsoft continues to be on the cutting edge, and customers get to take advantage of all the benefits of that,” says Boyd. “They’re getting the best training infrastructure, the best software, the best networking – all of these things combined give the best experience.”  
Our approach to using AI for social good
Microsoft believes AI can help people tackle some of society’s biggest global challenges. Our AI for Good initiative provides funding, technology and expertise to help individuals and nonprofits accelerate progress in fields, such as accessibility, digital literacy and equity, sustainability and climate change, human rights and resilience, health disparities, food insecurity, cybersecurity and others.
“There are problems where AI is uniquely positioned to help, where AI is not just another solution but is the only solution,” says Juan Lavista Ferres, Microsoft’s chief data scientist and the director of the AI for Good Lab.
One such project, for instance, involves mapping all the places where humans live in order to better understand natural disaster risks and guide preparedness efforts. Another includes mapping rooftops of buildings in India, noting the materials the structures are made of to help disaster teams prioritize those that are more likely to fail in certain types of disasters. Yet another is mapping all the renewable energy installations around the world to help show the impact of solar and wind farms.
“A person would spend 400 years looking at satellite imagery and understanding if humans live there or not, but AI can do this in an hour,” Lavista Ferres says. “These AI models make it easier for people to get all the information in one place, and from there the humans can make the necessary decisions.”
Microsoft’s AI for Good Lab is an applied research and data visualization laboratory that harnesses the power of big data and Azure’s cloud technology. Its team of data scientists works with strategic partners and experts from academia, nonprofits and governments to not only help address critical global concerns but also to better measure the progress of efforts underway and to identify gaps where aid might be helpful.
The projects are as varied as the problems and combine Microsoft’s efforts with those of our partners.
For example, the AI for Health program invests in research led by institutions such as Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, IRIS, the Novartis Foundation and Seattle Children’s Research Institute. These efforts are making healthcare more affordable, especially in places where doctors are few and medical needs are great.
Though we see great potential for AI’s assistance to help solve some of the world’s most pressing issues, we also recognize the limitations of the technology. It’s important to work through moral and ethical questions for every project, Lavista Ferres says, especially to make sure the models are getting enough data from enough places and aren’t leaving anyone out — for example, making sure all skin colors are represented for an app that detects skin cancer.
“When you train an AI model, it will be able to generalize from the data you have, but not from the data you don’t have, so any bias can generate problems,” he says. “Having humans in the loop is the key element. We are looking for solutions that can benefit everyone, not just particular cohorts of the population.”

How AI is changing every corner of the economy
Sat 18 Feb 2023 02.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 19 Feb 2023 06.28 ESTShareThe machines are coming and they will eat your job. That’s been a familiar refrain down the years, stretching back to the Luddites in the early 19th century. In the past, step-changes in technology have replaced low-paid jobs with a greater number of higher-paid jobs. This time, with the arrival of artificial intelligence, there are those who think it will be different.Politicians know that even in the best case AI will cause massive disruption to labour markets, but they are fooling themselves if they think they have years to come up with a suitable response. As the tech entrepreneur Mihir Shukla said at the recent World Economic Forum in Davos: “People keep saying AI is coming but it is already here.”Developments in machine learning and robotics have been moving on rapidly while the world has been preoccupied by the pandemic, inflation and war. AI stands to be to the fourth industrial revolution what the spinning jenny and the steam engine were to the first in the 18th century: a transformative technology that will fundamentally reshape economies.Are chatbots coming for your job?Read moreChange will not happen overnight but, as was the case in previous industrial revolutions, it will be painful for those affected, as millions of workers will be. Previously, machines replaced manual labour, leaving jobs that required cognitive skills to humans. Advances in AI – symbolised by ChatGPT – shows that machines can now have a decent stab at doing the creative stuff as well.ChatGPT is a machine that can write intelligently. Asked to come up with a version of Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg address in the style of Donald Trump, it will search its datasets for suitable source material and generate original content.Launched by the San Francisco-based research laboratory OpenAI in November last year, ChatGPT notched up its 100 millionth user in 60 days. By contrast, it took Facebook two years to reach the same milestone.Other new products will follow. The number of AI patents increased 30-fold between 2015 and 2021, according to a report from Stanford University in California. Robots are becoming cheaper and more sophisticated all the time.History suggests profound technological change presents significant challenges for policymakers. Each of the three previous industrial revolutions had a similar initial impact: it hollowed out jobs across the economy, it led to an increase in inequality and to a decline in the share of income going to labour.AI threatens to have precisely the same effects, but with one key difference. Left unchecked, owners of the new machines will make enormous sums of money out of their innovations. Capital will see its share of income rise at the expense of labour. There will be a hollowing out of some sectors of the economy but there will be employment growth in other sectors.The difference this time is that the jobs most at risk will be white-collar, middle-class jobs, while many of the jobs created might be of the low-paid, dead-end variety. As Shukla noted in Davos, the days of humans processing mortgage applications are already numbered.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Governments could invest more in education and training, so that workers have the skills they need to make a decent living. They might explore ways of spreading the gains from the new technology. Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have been among the most vocal supporters of a universal basic income.But whatever they do, policymakers need to act with care as well as speed. The economist Joseph Schumpeter popularised a phrase to describe how capitalism periodically reinvents itself. He called it creative destruction, and just such a process is in its early stages now. This article was amended on 19 February 2023. An earlier version said ChatGPT would “search the web” to generate original material in response to a question; while the AI program has datasets based drawn from numerous sources, including web articles, it is not connected to the internet.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingIndustrial policyanalysisShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himLiveUS elections: Kamala Harris to make first speech since Biden endorsement as more top Democrats back VP – live updatesFrance Unbowed MP sparks outrage by saying Israeli Olympians not welcome The post-Biden era may be uncertain for the Democrats, but for Trump it will be utterly dismayingSimon TisdallWhat is the Kamala Harris coconut tree meme and why is everyone sharing it?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That was guaranteed. The assumption generally was that they would take over manual labor, lifting heavy pallets in a warehouse and sorting recycling.Now significant advances in generative artificial intelligence mean robots are coming for artists, too.A.I.-generated images, created with simple text prompts, are winning art contests, adorning book covers, and promoting “The Nutcracker,” leaving human artists worried about their futures.The threat can feel highly personal. An image generator called Stable Diffusion was trained to recognize patterns, styles and relationships by analyzing billions of images collected from the public internet, alongside text describing their contents.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAmong the images it trained on were works by Greg Rutkowski, a Polish artist who specializes in fantastical scenes featuring dragons and magical beings.Seeing Mr. Rutkowski’s work alongside his name allowed the tool to learn his style effectively enough that when Stable Diffusion was released to the public last year, his name became shorthand for users who wanted to generate dreamy, fanciful images.ImageGreg Rutkowski, a Polish artist who specializes in fantastical scenes. His name has become shorthand for users who wanted to generate fanciful images.Credit...Dorota RutkowskaImageMr. Rutkowski’s “Castle Defense, 2018.”Credit...Greg RutkowskiOne artist noticed that the whimsical A.I. selfies that came out of the viral app Lensa had ghostly signatures on them, mimicking what the A.I. had learned from the data it trained on: artists who make portraits sign their work. “These databases were built without any consent, any permission from artists,” Mr. Rutkowski said.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSince the generators came out, Mr. Rutkowski said he has received far fewer requests from first-time authors who need covers for their fantasy novels. Meanwhile, Stability AI, the company behind Stable Diffusion, recently raised $101 million from investors and is now valued at over $1 billion.“Artists are afraid of posting new art,” the computer science professor Ben Zhao said. Putting art online is how many artists advertise their services but now they have a “fear of feeding this monster that becomes more and more like them,” Professor Zhao said. “It shuts down their business model.”That led Professor Zhao and a team of computer science researchers at the University of Chicago to design a tool called Glaze that aims to thwart A.I. models from learning a particular artist’s style. To design the tool, which they plan to make available for download, the researchers surveyed more than 1,100 artists and worked closely with Karla Ortiz, an illustrator and artist based in San Francisco.ImageBen Zhao, center, a professor of computer science, with his students Emily Wenger, left, and Shawn Shan, at the University of Chicago.Credit...Taylor Glascock for The New York TimesImageProfessor Zhao and a team of computer science researchers at the University of Chicago designed a tool called Glaze that aims to thwart A.I. models from learning a particular artist’s style.Credit...Taylor Glascock for The New York TimesSay, for example, that Ms. Ortiz wants to post new work online, but doesn’t want it fed to A.I. to steal it. She can upload a digital version of her work to Glaze and choose an art type different from her own, say abstract.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe tool then makes changes to Ms. Ortiz’s art at the pixel-level that Stable Diffusion would associate with, for example, the splattered paint blobs of Jackson Pollock.To the human eye, the Glazed image still looks like her work, but the computer-learning model would pick up on something very different. It’s similar to a tool the University of Chicago team previously created to protect photos from facial recognition systems.When Ms. Ortiz posted her Glazed work online, an image generator trained on those images wouldn’t be able to mimic her work. A prompt with her name would instead lead to images in some hybridized style of her works and Pollock’s.“We’re taking our consent back,” Ms. Ortiz said. A.I.-generating tools, many of which charge users a fee to generate images, “have data that doesn’t belong to them,” she said. “That data is my artwork, that’s my life. It feels like my identity.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe team at the University of Chicago admitted that their tool does not guarantee protection and could lead to countermeasures by anyone committed to emulating a particular artist. “We’re pragmatists,” Professor Zhao said. “We recognize the likely long delay before law and regulations and policies catch up. This is to fill that void.”Many legal experts compare the debate over the unfettered use of artists’ work for generative A.I. to pirating concerns in the early days of the internet with services like Napster that allowed people to consume music without paying for it. The generative A.I. companies are already facing a similar barrage of court challenges.Last month, Ms. Ortiz and two other artists filed a class-action lawsuit in California against companies with art-generating services, including Stability AI, asserting violations of copyright and right of publicity.“The allegations in this suit represent a misunderstanding of how generative A.I. technology works and the law surrounding copyright,” the company said in a statement. Stability AI was also sued by Getty Images for copying millions of photos without a license. “We are reviewing the documents and will respond accordingly,” a company spokeswoman said.ImageMs. Ortiz and two other artists have filed a class-action lawsuit against companies with art-generating services.Credit...Jim Wilson/The New York TimesAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTImageMs. Ortiz’s work as mimicked by A.I., with and without Glaze’s protection.Credit...Ben ZhaoJeanne Fromer, a professor of intellectual property law at New York University, said the companies may have a strong fair use argument. “How do human artists learn to create art?” Professor Fromer said. “They’re often copying things and they’re consuming lots of existing artwork and learning patterns and pieces of the style and then creating new artwork. And so at a certain level of abstraction, you could say machines are learning to make art the same way.”At the same time, Professor Fromer said, the aim of copyright law is to protect and encourage human creativity. “If we care about protecting a profession,” she said, “or we think just the making of the art is important to who we are as a society, we might want to be protective of artists.”A nonprofit called the Concept Art Association recently raised over $200,000 through GoFundMe to hire a lobbying firm to try to persuade Congress to protect artists’ intellectual property. “We are up against the tech giants with unlimited budgets, but we are confident that Congress will recognize that protecting IP is the right side of the argument,” said the association’s founders, Nicole Hendrix and Rachel Meinerding.Raymond Ku, a copyright law professor at Case Western Reserve University, predicted that the art generators, rather than just taking art scraped from the internet, will eventually develop some kind of “private contractual system that ensures some degree of compensation to the creator.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIn other words, artists might get paid a nominal amount when their art is used to train A.I. and inspire new images, similar to how musicians get paid by music-streaming companies.Andy Baio, a writer and technologist who examined the training data used by Stable Diffusion, said these services can mimic an artist’s style because they see the artist’s name alongside their work over and over again. “You could go and remove names from a data set,” Mr. Baio said, to prevent the A.I. from explicitly learning an artist’s style.ImageExamples of art generated by Stable Diffusion using Mr. Rutkowski’s name in prior and current versions of the software.Credit...Greg RutkowskiOne service already seems to have done something along these lines. When Stability AI released a new version of Stable Diffusion in November, it had a notable change: the prompt “Greg Rutkowski” no longer worked to get images in his style, a development noted by the company’s chief executive Emad Mostaque.Stable Diffusion fans were disappointed. “What did you do to greg,” one wrote on an official Discord forum frequented by Mr. Mostaque. He reassured users of the forum that they could customize the model. “Training on greg won’t be too difficult,” another person responded.Mr. Rutkowski said he planned to start Glazing his work.A correction was made on Feb. 13, 2023: An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the university at which Raymond Ku is a copyright law professor.

The Central Intelligence Agency is getting set to explore using chatbots and generative artificial intelligence capabilities to assist its officers in completing day-to-day job functions and their overarching spy missions.
Lakshmi Raman, the CIA’s AI director, confirmed these plans at the Potomac Officers Club’s annual AI summit in Virginia on Thursday. In doing so Raman, who has served as a CIA official since 2002 when she entered as a software engineer, emphasized that her team is being deliberate about understanding the “guardrails needed” when applying such emerging technologies to the intelligence community’s operations.
“Honestly, we’ve seen the excitement in the public space around ChatGPT. It’s certainly an inflection point in this technology, and we definitely need to [be exploring] ways in which we can leverage new and upcoming technologies. And I think the way we’re approaching it is we need to approach it in a disciplined way,” she said.
ChatGPT refers to a chatbot developed by OpenAI that’s gone viral since its launch in late 2022. The tool is part of the field of generative AI, which involves large language models that can generate audio, code, images, text, videos and other media — when prompted by humans to do so.

In the last few months, multiple federal entities have announced aims to pursue this nascent technology seriously and strategically — and now the CIA is joining that cadre.
“A lot of work is underway to ensure the CIA’s success in becoming a mature and AI-driven organization, as well as expanding our understanding of adversaries’ use of AI and [machine learning] capabilities,” Raman said during her keynote.  
She detailed, for example, how the agency is creating a common platform to enable shared services — to ultimately actualize and scale AI applications — and establishing new resources and opportunities to increase its staff’s familiarity with smart and automated technologies.
More recently, the CIA’s AI team also started to sharpen its attention on how ChatGPT and similar capabilities might provide more advanced assistance to agency personnel as they conduct critical intelligence processes. 
“Admittedly, the task of evaluating which tools are best for the U.S. government’s purposes is a daunting one,” Raman said.

The CIA is “looking for help in this area” of deploying generative AI, she noted, via federally funded research-and-development centers and other partners in academia and industry. “We are working across all of these elements to help us evaluate the myriad of tools and commercial products available,” Raman said.
In her view, one key area that the CIA is struggling with presently “is integrating tools built on the outside,” into its “high-side” environments, or those associated with classified and protected national security computer systems. The approval and accreditation process for new contractors can often be long and strenuous, and many — including Raman — argue that it should be modernized and streamlined. 
“We must figure out how to embrace a more flexible innovative approach for AI, even as that approach introduces more uncertainty into the system,” she said.

Artificial intelligence could create more jobs than it displaces
06:51

Amid major developments in the field of artificial intelligence, there's a question many of us have been asking ourselves: How long until machines replace us? New systems from Google and Microsoft — plus a Microsoft partner called OpenAI — are capable of doing things we used to think were uniquely human, like creating original art and generating original writing. The possibilities are huge. But so are the fears — about jobs and wages in particular.  






As artificial intelligence gets better, some expect job security will get worse. In reports like one in Gizmodo earlier this month, titled, ""Here Are the Jobs Our New AI Overlords Plan to Kill,"" coding or computer programming is often on the list.  But it seems none of the AI coding software currently out there can replace the talent of professional coders. In fact, it may help them.  


Sam Zanca, a coder and instructor at General Assembly, a coding school in New York, said AI will ""definitely automate the more tedious parts"" of his job, ""but it's still a long ways away before having a true impact.""He's not very worried about AI right now.But ""the problem is that ... I'm not entirely sure if the AI that would replace me is 10 years from now, 20 years from now, or five years from now,"" he said.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is a big believer in AI — but not the idea that AI is coming for our jobs. 


""I believe it creates more, I will call it both satisfaction in current jobs and net new jobs,"" Nadella told CBS News earlier this month. Ahead of the launch of the new AI-powered Bing, Nadella argued that artificial intelligence could help the economy across the board.  ""My biggest worry is we need some new technology ... that starts driving real productivity,"" Nadella said. ""It's time for some real innovation."" He believes AI will drive up wages, ""because productivity and wages are related."" But while that may be true in the long run, MIT economist David Autor believes the rise of AI does indeed mean millions of jobs are going to change in our lifetimes. And what's scary is: we're not sure how. ""We are very good at forecasting what we will not be doing and very poor at forecasting what we will be doing,"" Autor said.He points out, for example, that more than 60% of the types of jobs people are doing today didn't even exist in the 1940s, while many of the jobs that did exist have been replaced. 


""What we've seen over the last four decades in the U.S. and many industrialized economies is what economists call labor market polarization, which means the hollowing out of the middle set of jobs ... kind of middle class jobs involving blue collar production and operative work, but also ... administrative support clerical tasks,"" he said. ""We had banks and banks of people who answered phones, who did typing and filing, who reproduced documents, who kept tables and books. Many, many of these things are now done by machines."" The ""hollowing out"" of the middle has led to some in the labor market moving up and making more money, while others are now making less — and ""that's especially where the pain happens,"" Autor said. That also troubles Meredith Whittaker, who co-founded the AI Now Institute at New York University to study how all these new systems of artificial intelligence will affect our lives. ""They don't replace human labor. They just require different forms of labor to sort of babysit them, to train them, to make sure they're working well,"" Whittaker said.""Whose work will be degraded and whose house in the Hamptons will get another wing?"" she asked, clarifying that she uses ""degrade"" to mean that someone will still have a job, but it will pay less. ""I think that's the fundamental question when we look at these technologies and ask about questions about work.""

New systems from Google and Microsoft — plus a Microsoft partner called OpenAI — are capable of doing things we used to think were uniquely human, like creating original art and generating original writing. The possibilities are huge. But so are the fears — about jobs and wages in particular. As artificial intelligence gets better, some expect job security will get worse. In reports like one in Gizmodo earlier this month, titled, ""Here Are the Jobs Our New AI Overlords Plan to Kill,"" coding or computer programming is often on the list.  But it seems none of the AI coding software currently out there can replace the talent of professional coders. In fact, it may help them.  Sam Zanca, a coder and instructor at General Assembly, a coding school in New York, said AI will ""definitely automate the more tedious parts"" of his job, ""but it's still a long ways away before having a true impact.""He's not very worried about AI right now.But ""the problem is that ... I'm not entirely sure if the AI that would replace me is 10 years from now, 20 years from now, or five years from now,"" he said.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is a big believer in AI — but not the idea that AI is coming for our jobs. ""I believe it creates more, I will call it both satisfaction in current jobs and net new jobs,"" Nadella told CBS News earlier this month. Ahead of the launch of the new AI-powered Bing, Nadella argued that artificial intelligence could help the economy across the board.  ""My biggest worry is we need some new technology ... that starts driving real productivity,"" Nadella said. ""It's time for some real innovation."" He believes AI will drive up wages, ""because productivity and wages are related."" But while that may be true in the long run, MIT economist David Autor believes the rise of AI does indeed mean millions of jobs are going to change in our lifetimes. And what's scary is: we're not sure how. ""We are very good at forecasting what we will not be doing and very poor at forecasting what we will be doing,"" Autor said.He points out, for example, that more than 60% of the types of jobs people are doing today didn't even exist in the 1940s, while many of the jobs that did exist have been replaced. ""What we've seen over the last four decades in the U.S. and many industrialized economies is what economists call labor market polarization, which means the hollowing out of the middle set of jobs ... kind of middle class jobs involving blue collar production and operative work, but also ... administrative support clerical tasks,"" he said. ""We had banks and banks of people who answered phones, who did typing and filing, who reproduced documents, who kept tables and books. Many, many of these things are now done by machines."" The ""hollowing out"" of the middle has led to some in the labor market moving up and making more money, while others are now making less — and ""that's especially where the pain happens,"" Autor said. That also troubles Meredith Whittaker, who co-founded the AI Now Institute at New York University to study how all these new systems of artificial intelligence will affect our lives. ""They don't replace human labor. They just require different forms of labor to sort of babysit them, to train them, to make sure they're working well,"" Whittaker said.""Whose work will be degraded and whose house in the Hamptons will get another wing?"" she asked, clarifying that she uses ""degrade"" to mean that someone will still have a job, but it will pay less. ""I think that's the fundamental question when we look at these technologies and ask about questions about work.""","{'@context': 'https://schema.org', '@type': 'VideoObject', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.cbsnews.com/video/artificial-intelligence-could-create-more-jobs-than-it-displaces/'}, 'name': 'Artificial intelligence could create more jobs than it displaces', 'description': 'The recent wave of artificial intelligence advancements has stirred up concern about the threat it poses to white-collar jobs.

 AI is becoming more human day after day, and with this technology continuously booming, many new sectors are rising in popularity. In this article, we will discuss the various career options available to you in the field of artificial intelligence based on your education in information technology, computer science, or software engineering. 






 1. Robotics Engineer 

 

 Have you ever thought about the possibilities that come with building, installing, testing, and maintaining your own robot? Robotics engineers are in high demand, as these skill sets come with a range of benefits for many industries. You could be part of the next innovative robot product with a focus on creating and maintaining automated machines while applying machine learning. 

 If you're great with numbers and want a rewarding career, robotics engineering is essential in manufacturing, agriculture, health care, food preparation, and the military, so this is guaranteed to offer you job security, satisfaction, and the chance to do something positive for many. 







 2. Software Engineer 

 

 Do you have amazing problem-solving skills and want to do more than just repair computer systems? Software engineers are a well-known career choice in technology and are increasingly in high demand. This is the backbone of technology as we view it today. 

 These professionals specialize in building software, to put it simply. Microsoft Office or Google Chrome? Made by software engineers. Companies are always needing advanced software to offer to customers to fulfill their needs, and software engineers have the skills to provide programs that work. 






 Software engineers can branch into AI by building software that includes speech recognition, machine learning, and the overall end-user system. Professionals in this career can expect to not only create software, but also maintain it with updates. 

 This is a vital aspect of AI and the foundation for creating software that will influence and help many people navigate complex technology. Cortana is a great example here. Imagine being able to build your own virtual assistant. 



 3. Computer Vision Engineer 

 

 Are you good at visualizing the information in front of you? Computer vision engineers focus largely on algorithms and visual data, and big companies such as Apple need them. They utilize artificial intelligence and also assist with its creation of it. 






 By creating algorithms that are automated and maintaining them, computer vision engineering consists of hazard detection in self-driving cars, facial recognition, and also content control on social media sites such as Facebook, just to name a few. 

 These all contain an automated system very similar to artificial intelligence, and it can be expected that in the next few years, this career is expected to expand and flourish. If working with data through feeds of video, analog images, or digital signals sounds up your alley, this is a good career to envision. 



 4. Data Scientist 

 






 No, this isn't the same as a computer vision engineer. If you're good at organizing data as well as keeping track of it, you may enjoy a career that numerous organizations utilize. A data scientist is responsible for collecting and transforming data into a format that provides: 

 Insight to those who need it.  Making forecasts.  Ensuring this data works for companies.  

 Another large task for data scientists is fixing data corruption, or screening information it is processing, which will be a crucial part of having functioning artificial intelligence. This career choice is perfect for someone with an analytical brain who loves to work with data! 



 5. Big Data Engineer or Architect 

 






 Do you think you can work with larger scales of information? Big data engineers design and maintain massive systems used for the processing of data. These engineers will be vital in managing this large influx of data, and AI will process and manage the data related to how people want AI to be delivered. 

 There is a significant demand for people in this field due to a lack of skilled workers, and it is excellent for anyone who enjoys math or is analytical. Want to learn more about technology areas that focus on numbers? Check out the top careers in data science. 



 6. Data Analyst 

 

 A data analyst is very similar to a data scientist, but it's all about analyzing the trends of data over time. Overall, there is less responsibility, but the work involves using current data instead of making predictions and forecasts. This is a widespread role that many companies use to analyze the constant information they absorb on a daily basis. 





 For example, if you'd like to assist an AI program and its current potential for customers, you can be a big help to those wanting to expand. Data analysts are in high demand because AI is continually used to identify patterns and collect data, so even a position that doesn't involve creating AI will use it. 



 7. AI Ethicists 

 

 Many people have questioned whether AI is truly a disruptive technology, and AI ethicists are here to ensure they are made use of properly. These professionals have the sole responsibility of programming viewpoints, beliefs, political ideas, and general good behaviors into AI to prevent them from acting in harmful ways, which could end in severe consequences for many companies. 





 If you want to be in control of the behavior of how AI works, this is a great career choice. If you're interested in this topic, have a look at the ethical pros and cons of AI art generation. This may even encourage you to work in the field. 



 8. UX Designer or Developer 

 

 Do you have an eye for design as well as great programming skills? A UX Designer, also known as a user experience designer or developer, has the role of creating the way in which a person engages with the program or website they are using. This includes everything you can see and interact with, something as simple as buttons. 






 All features of a website or program are carefully designed to make users feel certain ways during use. For example, a program designed for seniors would be non-stressful and easy to use. In AI, this would extend to how the user interacts with it, whether in software or hardware form, such as robotics. Imagine being part of the creation of a home robot that doesn't need many commands to use. 



 Pursue a Career in Artificial Intelligence 
 The use of artificial intelligence is expanding into dozens of new sectors, creating many new jobs, and making many businesses more efficient. As a student or graduate, you can rest assured that if you want to start a career in AI, there is plenty of opportunity in an industry that is evolving, stable, and always needs skilled IT graduates to get these jobs done.

by Samantha Yeo • 20 Feb 2023Is artificial intelligence our friend or foe?What will innovations in artificial intelligence mean for those who live and work in Singapore? We speak to experts to find out.Do you remember the movie, The Terminator? I used to think the idea of robots taking over the world was pure fiction when I watched it years ago. However, the latest advancements in artificial intelligence – even in Singapore – suggest this is already becoming a reality. AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Bard are just a few examples of this: they can hold personalised and efficient interactions that are remarkably realistic.In fact, this is really just the tip of the iceberg. There are several AI systems available online that offer services such as generated art and deepfake software capable of superimposing faces and voices. It’s expected that AI will cause a radical transformation in society in the near future.It’s no surprise that many have concerns about how this will impact the way we live and work. If AI can do whatever we do, what does it mean for humanity? Will it take over our lives completely? We chat with industry experts to find out.The rise of artificial intelligence in Singapore: A robot barista, a virtual influencer and chatbotsPhotography: Ella via FacebookThe eerie and fascinating thing about AI is that it improves our lives in the most subtle ways. Curious about where you might have encountered artificial intelligence in Singapore? If you work near Raffles Place, you may have already met Ella, an AI-powered robot barista created by Keith Tan, CEO and founder of Crown Digital. Ella can produce 200 cups of coffee an hour, 23 hours a day. Talk about high efficiency!Not only can Ella create over 300 coffee combinations, but she’s also wired for hyper-personalisation. This means you get your coffee just the way you like it. Plus, with a mobile app to order and pay, you can bid adieu to pesky queues and save precious minutes during your morning commute.According to Keith, the purpose of AI is to enhance, not to replace. That’s why Ella is meticulously programmed to be unparalleled in efficiency, consistency, and efficacy. With Ella around, the team can focus on other aspects of the business that prioritise and elevate the human touch.We’ve also seen artificial intelligence play, move, and work in the form of Rae, Singapore’s hyper-realistic virtual influencer. She’s obsessed with all things fashion, particularly streetwear. And despite her existing only on the digital plane, everyone wants a piece of her. She’s already completed projects with top-notch brands like Asus, Shiseido, Penfolds, and Nars.According to Rae, she’s a true blue Singaporean and considers herself an avid digital content creator. “I am geographically boundless. That means I can go for a shoot overseas and come back for a launch party in an instant,” she says. With that kind of flexibility, it’s no wonder she’s so popular.You may also have noticed the use of AI in customer service – think ‘Ask Bo’, AirAsia’s new chatbot that handles all online enquiries. And even smart systems that secure your home and regulate lighting and temperature.The AI advantage: Reshaping customer service, education and businessPhotography: Pavel Danilyuk via PexelsElsewhere, in China, AI has been a game changer for hotel efficiency especially at Microtel by Wyndham Tianjin. The hotel uses self-check-in kiosks, in-room speakers, and delivery robots that make 30 to 40 trips a day delivering water, towels, and amenities to guests.“This reduces the need for staff to engage in such tasks so they can focus on other value-added aspects of service and operations that require a personalised, human touch,” says Carl Wee, VP, technical services APAC of Wyndham Hotels and Resorts Asia Pacific. While some worry about job security, experts believe AI can drive up brand loyalty and productivity.“AI has given businesses a new dimension of growth, with conversational AI becoming a necessity for businesses to elevate their customer experiences,” says Rashid Khan, CPO and co-founder of Yellow.ai. His AI agent has helped Zalora serve millions of new users, powering over four million conversation sessions.Saurabh Madan, VP and general manager of SEA, ANZ and Japan at MoEngage agrees that AI can help build a loyal customer base. With never-ending deals, upgrades, and flashier products, lifetime loyalty is a thing of the past. That’s why he’s all about hyper-personalisation, and his platform has already helped an Indonesian e-commerce platform boost repeat purchases by 43%.The impact of AI is also being felt in the education sector, with AI-based learning revolutionising how schools deliver learning strategies and performance insights. Sandesh Shetty, co-founder of Explico, an AI-powered online learning platform based in Singapore, says AI can create a personalised environment for students, allowing them to make mistakes and receive tailored feedback without fear of judgment.Furthermore, this technology can assist in curbing the rapid spread of misinformation online, enabling leadership teams to stay ahead of fast-paced threats, according to Wasim Khaled, co-founder and CEO of Blackbird.AI.What's TrendingThe wellness metaverse will change life as we know itNavigating the blurred lines of AI usageWe explore the pros and cons of artificial intelligence.Plagiarism and art theft has always been a thorny subject in the creative world, and the rise of AI has only made things more complicated. Take the Lensa app, for example. It caused quite a stir when people found out it might have stolen artwork from real artists to create its artsy portraits.And the impact of AI isn’t just limited to the creative realm. In finance, AI-powered systems can be vulnerable to cyber attacks, putting people’s financial security at risk. And in industries like media and law, relying too much on AI can lead to the spread of inaccurate or biased data, which can damage public trust.However, local artists and art educators have a more optimistic view of the technology’s potential. The key, they say, is for humans to work alongside AI, nurturing its growth and evolution.Winson Ho, a senior lecturer at Nafa’s School of Design and Media, believes in taking an active approach to integrate AI with the art curriculum. While Muhammad Izdiharuddin, an adjunct lecturer at Nafa’s School of Fine Art, sees potential for AI in helping artists better visualise their work.As the technology matures, it’s crucial to maintain ethical considerations to avoid unintended negative consequences. “We need to have continuous conversations about managing the human side of this digital disruption,” says Muhammad Izdiharuddin.Keane Tan, a UOB Painting of the Year artist, believes AI can help artists focus on new areas like highlighting the human experience and appreciating the natural world. He references artists Roy Lichtenstein and Nam June Paik, who effectively used the technologies of their time, namely commercial printing and video art respectively, to advance their creative visions.Another UOB Painting of the Year artist, Eugene Tan, emphasises that both artists who create with AI and those who do not are equally valuable. It’s an opportunity that provides new ways of appreciating the traditional craft as well as new AI-generated works of art. He highlights that it’s awards, galleries, and curators that will have a bigger influence in curating art that highlights contemporary issues of the day.In essence, we need to use AI responsibly – weighing the pros and cons to ensure we reap the benefits without the drawbacks.Where do we stand in all of this?Photography: Tara Winstead via PexelsThere’s no denying that the use of artificial intelligence in Singapore is a double-edged sword – one that will present opportunities and challenges in various industries. Rashid shares that AI platforms like ChatGPT will contribute to lowering the barrier of entry for anyone who is not a professional. But, at the same time, it will raise the ceiling for output for those who are already skilled.“AI is not about man versus machine as some of us have been brought up to think. Ultimately, doing more with less is the goal here – with chatbots tackling high volumes of repetitive queries and humans taking on more higher value tasks,” adds Malcolm Koh, director of customer experience practice at Zendesk.Take the invention of ATMs for example. It was expected that bank tellers would be completely replaced. But they didn’t disappear; they just moved on to perform more sophisticated tasks beyond simply dispensing cash. In fact, more bank tellers were hired even as ATMs increased in number. Who says you can’t teach an old teller new tricks?In a similar vein, the World Economic Forum predicts that while 85 million jobs will be replaced by AI by 2025, 97 million new jobs will be created in return. Think positions like machine learning engineers and data scientists.So, will AI take over the world? Yes, but not in the way we think it will. Unfortunately (or fortunately), we won’t be out of work and sipping cocktails on Siloso beach just yet. While AI will enhance our human capabilities and plug gaps where we fall short, it’s best used in collaboration with us. It may change career trajectories and overhaul job scopes, but it won’t really affect the way we live.Unless artificial intelligence becomes sentient… but that’s a story for another day.Need more Honeycombers in your life?

<span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">According to Aditya Narayan Mishra, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of CIEL HR Services, ""ChatGPT has the potential to disrupt some <a href=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/trends/news-corp-to-cut-1250-jobs/"">businesses</a>, but it is unlikely to instantly create job losses."" Based on its potential, ChatGPT has a decent probability of displacing some.</span>

<strong><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">AI's effects on future work positions</span></strong>

<span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">There is no question in our minds that practically every sector and aspect of life in the modern world has been impacted by <a href=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/trends/top-biotechnology-companies-india-2023/"">technology</a> in one way or another. Although it seems to be in their hands, we are unsure of how much control they have over it. There is always more than one side to a story, as the cliché goes. </span>

<span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Regarding technology as well, there is no exception to this law. There are two schools of thinking about the use of artificial intelligence as a tool for increasing employment. Others see it as a tool that can help create more human employment, while some regard it as a danger to human jobs.</span>

<span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">In my opinion, robots and artificial intelligence are not out to deprive us of our livelihood. Instead, they are there to in some way ease our lives. Robots and artificial intelligence will give humans a lot of chances in the future. According to the projection and the study, even though nearly 1.7 million jobs have been lost to automation since 2000, <a href=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/trends/10-artificial-intelligence-powered-apps/"">artificial intelligence</a> is predicted to produce 97 million new employment by 2025, even though almost 1.7 million jobs have been lost to it since 2000.</span>

<span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">In essence, you can now start to understand how technology may truly be used by humans as a tool to benefit them in the long term and not simply as a bad thing. Artificial intelligence will undoubtedly be the main force shortly, in my opinion. In the not-too-distant future, it will have a significant influence on the world as we currently know it.</span>

<span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Some individuals become quite enthusiastic when they discover something new, but others have a fairly dismal or doomy picture in their heads when they are learning about the same event. This is just one example of the many differences that occur between people. We must remain confident in our grasp of the reality that AI will not be able to completely replace human labor in the <a href=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/trends/psychological-harassments/"">workplace</a>.</span>

<span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">There are a handful of specialized profiles that call for a lot of imagination, empathy, and last-minute complicated political frameworks. Robots or artificial intelligence cannot, under any circumstances, replace human professionals such as <a href=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/trends/the-metaverse-is-trending-innovative/"">educators</a>, authors, designers, lawyers, social workers, defense attorneys, and healthcare providers. Shortly, numerous areas, including all those listed above, can benefit from the technical breakthroughs of artificial intelligence. These, however, are unable to duplicate the human element or emotional connection that these areas demand.</span>

<span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Since we go towards the era of digitization, people feel a need to collaborate with a new environment. Of course, we will need to accomplish this with the aid of technology, as the existence of technology in our everyday lives necessitates that we adjust to it. There is a tremendous desire for the advantages AI may provide the workplace. Despite this, it shouldn't alter the reality that the human touch will always remain in both <a href=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/trends/amid-weak-demand-lg-posted-record/"">demand</a> and fashion.</span>

<span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;""> Experts predict that artificial intelligence will be a great benefit to humanity. Humans may be able to spend less time on laborious chores that are a part of their overall duties. The resource should be able to concentrate on comp projects. He will be able to serve the employer and resource in the best possible way as a result. Life is full of change, and that is a reality. We must be ready to adjust to the effects of change since we cannot prevent them. We must learn to accept that things will occasionally change if we want to live.<img src=""https://economymiddleeast.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/shutterstock_2237829091-1-e1671709051139.jpg"" alt=""ChatGPT is making heads-turn, and for good reason"" /></span>

<strong><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Significant change is on the way.</span></strong>

<span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">A better, more evolved, new world is on its way, and we need to pull our socks up because it's time for a<a href=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/stories/digital-democracy-in-indonesia/""> significant transformation</a>. It's just a matter of time until we start doing instead of complaining. There are several sacrifices required in the context of re-adjustments. It is completely unfair and foolish to fail to plan for the future and instead live in the now. Furthermore, a person's capacity to express kindness, compassion, understanding, and love for one another will always be appreciated as an asset not only in the present but also in the future.</span>

<span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Furthermore, a person's capacity to express kindness, compassion, understanding, and love for one another will always be appreciated as an advantage not only now but also in the future. No technology can ever replace the power of compassion, and it will always win out above all other considerations. Artificial intelligence research is increasing at an exponential rate. Almost every market sector employs a diverse range of applications. These include, in various ways, autonomous automobiles, education, infrastructure, defense, health,<a href=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/trends/social-security-developments-in-the/""> social security</a>, cancer detection, and the construction of agricultural yield models.</span>

<span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">It is also worth noting that several platforms provide degrees and certificates in AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. However, there are extremely few competent candidates for these roles. There is now a lack of searchers because of a dearth of competent personnel. As a result, there has been a haphazard recruiting procedure, which has delayed the smart integration of intelligent robots into the workplace.</span>

<span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Because all forms of occupations encounter fierce competition, machine learning and artificial intelligence jobs confront far less competition than other types of jobs. There are a growing number of specialized <a href=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/trends/byjus-continues-to-eliminate/"">engineering jobs</a> on the market, but there are still a large number of open vacancies. The paucity of competent persons to fill these professions is another element contributing to the market's shortage of skilled workers.</span>

<span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">The scope of AI research is broadening. From driverless automobiles to models for cancer diagnosis, the application cases touch practically every area. Similarly, several platforms provide degrees and certificates in <a href=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/trends/artificial-intelligence-business-2026/"">AI, Machine Learning</a>, and Deep Learning all at the same time. </span>

<span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">However, the number of people working in these industries is quite low. AI will establish a distinct dividing line of tasks that can be mastered if they are properly trained and taught, which will outweigh the danger to unskilled employment. Even though artificial intelligence has taken over many industries, there are still numerous employment available if you continue to study and upskill yourself.</span>

<span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">According to World Economic Forum research, machines will automate 50% of all workplace operations by 2025, up from 29% presently. According to the research, this is an increase from 29% today. By 2022, roughly half of the enterprises in the industry are likely to have significantly fewer employees. However, automation is likely to result in the <a href=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/trends/adani-lowers-development/"">development</a> of new employment in the whole industry at the same time.</span>

<span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">The amount of necessity for various professions in different places tends to range greatly, which is one of the most relevant factors. While there is a lot of hype around artificial intelligence <a href=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/trends/is-it-gdp-or-rising-unemployment-that-is-critical-in-india-today-what-does-the-future-look-like-and-what-is-the-biggest-challenge-before-india-in-the-coming-year/"">replacing employment</a>, much of this is because the types of occupations being considered to have a lot to do with the kind of jobs that will be replaced. True, certain components of work can be automated, but there are some aspects of a job that cannot be mechanized. There is a good likelihood that artificial intelligence can and will become a component of future occupations in a variety of ways.</span>

<strong><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Entry-level and junior positions</span></strong>

<span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">According to Mishra, ChatGPT poses a possible threat to positions at the entry and junior organizational levels. Jobs like software tester, help desk analyst, telesales, customer support, content producer, secondary research, and design may be impacted, he noted. According to Mishra, ChatGPT may minimize the number of persons needed to complete a task in some jobs. Nevertheless, to handle and analyze the enormous quantity of data generated every day, additional employment will be created in the fields of education, media, <a href=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/stories/uks-trade-unions-up-in-arms-healthcare-transport-and-schools-brace-for-impact/"">healthcare</a>, data processing, research, innovation, and so forth.</span>

<strong><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Jobs that include routine activities</span></strong>

<span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Human resource (HR) workers may focus on strategic and high-value operations by automating repetitive procedures with ChatGPT technology, which can help simplify HR processes. According to Sarvesh Agrawal, founder, and CEO of Internshala, a career-tech platform, ""for instance, to execute several duties like answering employee inquiries, formulating HR rules, <a href=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/trends/best-content-writing-companies-india/"">writing job descriptions</a>, analyzing databases, conducting employee surveys, etc., would require multiple people. He said that by using ChatGPT, fewer experts could be able to complete the same jobs as effectively.</span>

<span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">S Pasupathi, Chief Operating Officer of HirePro, a supplier of recruitment automation and assessment solutions, thinks ChatGPT may help businesses by providing email writing assistants, data entry clerks, chatbots, conversational UI (user interface) developers, and particularly content writers.<img src=""https://www.nti.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AI-Stock-Photo-scaled.jpg"" alt=""Assessing and Managing the Benefits and Risks of Artificial Intelligence in Nuclear-Weapon Systems"" /></span>

<strong><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Tasks with little room for creativity</span></strong>

<span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">According to Anuj Agarwal, the founder, and CEO of the recruiting company Zyoin, the influence of these technologies on the job market depends on how widely they are used in different sectors. Meanwhile, he continued, ""it is straightforward to argue that professions requiring the execution of simple tasks would be harmed, but jobs requiring sophisticated human abilities, such as creativity, <a href=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/trends/10-best-marketing-companies-india-2023/"">inventiveness</a>, empathy, and critical thinking, will not be touched."" As a result of AI technologies accomplishing the same task in a matter of minutes, employment for creating social media posts and graphics is in danger in this situation.</span>
