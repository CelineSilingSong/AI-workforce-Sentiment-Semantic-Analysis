That largely depends on whether we're technology optimists or pessimists. In our Future of Work series we look at how jobs might change in the future.The Snewing family lived in 62 Falkner Street, Liverpool, for more than four decades. They were saddlers working in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. And while the horse-drawn economy dominated, they enjoyed a brisk trade.But then, as the BBC Two series A House Through Time relates, along came the motor car.Rival saddlery businesses saw the lie of the land and turned to making leather footballs, handbags and luggage instead. The Snewings sadly carried on regardless and eventually went out of business.That, in a nutshell, is the challenge we face when new technologies come along. Adapt or die. But it is the pace of technological change that is unprecedented in the modern era and which poses the greatest challenge for jobs.Getty ImagesFord's Model-T motorcar symbolised the death-knell for the horse-drawn economyGetty ImagesSaddlers didn't disappear completely as engines replaced horses, but businesses had to adaptThese days algorithms dictate the automated trading of trillions of dollars' worth of assets in the financial markets.

But now they can flip burgers, flick away unripe tomatoes on a high-speed sorting machine using image recognition, lay bricks, even co-operate to open doors and escape.

The highest growth rate is in Asia, China in particular.And software automation, informed by machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), will have a profound effect on our workplaces and the jobs we do.""AI is a big threat to low-skilled jobs, no question,"" says Bernard Louvat, general manager of digital customer engagement solutions at tech firm Nuance.Getty ImagesWill robots really be able to help around the house or care for the elderly?""I don't think we're ready to handle this problem yet.""He thinks clever chatbots will replace most call centre staff within 10 years.""A virtual assistant can handle 60%-80% of all customer conversations now without any need for a human agent to intervene - five years ago it would have been 25%-30%,"" he says.""Chatbots are certainly eliminating jobs - we need fewer and fewer human agents each year.

When you think that a huge telecoms company like AT&T employs about 100,000 call centre agents to look after its 120 million customers, that's a lot of jobs that could disappear pretty quickly.

The late Stephen Hawking was a major voice in the debate about how humanity can benefit from artificial intelligence. Hawking made no secret of his fears that thinking machines could one day take charge. He went as far as predicting that future developments in AI “could spell the end of the human race.”
But Hawking’s relationship with AI was far more complex than this often-cited soundbite. The deep concerns he expressed were about superhuman AI, the point at which AI systems not only replicate human intelligence processes, but also keep expanding them, without our support – a stage that is at best decades away, if it ever happens at all. And yet Hawking’s very ability to communicate those fears, and all his other ideas, came to depend on basic AI technology.
Hawking’s conflicted relationship with AI
At the intellectual property and health law centers at DePaul University, my colleagues and I study the effects of emerging technologies like the ones Stephen Hawking worried about. At its core, the concept of AI involves computational technology designed to make machines function with foresight that mimics, and ultimately surpasses, human thinking processes.
Hawking cautioned against an extreme form of AI, in which thinking machines would “take off” on their own, modifying themselves and independently designing and building ever more capable systems. Humans, bound by the slow pace of biological evolution, would be tragically outwitted.
AI as a threat to humanity?
Well before it gets to the point of superhuman technology, AI can be put to terrible uses. Already, scholars and commentators worry that self-flying drones may be precursors to lethal autonomous robots. 
Today’s early stage AI raises several other ethical and practical problems, too. AI systems are largely based on opaque algorithms that make decisions even their own designers may be unable to explain. The underlying mathematical models can be biased, and computational errors may occur. AI may progressively displace human skills and increase unemployment. And limited access to AI might increase global inequality.
The One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence, launched by Stanford University in 2014, highlighted some of these concerns. But so far it has identified no evidence that AI will pose any “imminent threat” to humankind, as Hawking feared.
Still, Hawking’s views on AI are somewhat less alarmist and more nuanced than he usually gets credit for. At their heart, they describe the need to understand and regulate emerging technologies. He repeatedly called for more research on the benefits and dangers of AI. And he believed that even non-superhuman AI systems could help eradicate war, poverty and disease.
Hawking talks
This apparent contradiction – a fear of humanity being eventually overtaken by AI but optimism about its benefits in the meantime – may have come from his own life: Hawking had come to rely on AI to interact with the world.
Unable to speak since 1985, he used a series of different communication systems that helped him talk and write, culminating in the now-legendary computer operated by one muscle in his right cheek.
The first iteration of the computer program was exasperatingly slow and prone to errors. Very basic AI changed that. An open-source program made his word selection significantly faster. More importantly, it used artificial intelligence to analyze Hawking’s own words, and then used that information to help him express new ideas. By processing Hawking’s books, articles and lecture scripts, the system got so good that he did not even have to type the term people most associate with him, “the black hole.” When he selected “the,” “black” would automatically be suggested to follow it, and “black” would prompt “hole” onto the screen.


Stephen Hawking discusses a predictive system that helped him communicate.

AI improves people’s health
Stephen Hawking’s experience with such a basic form of AI illustrates how non-superhuman AI can indeed change people’s lives for the better. Speech prediction helped him cope with a devastating neurological disease. Other AI-based systems are already helping prevent, fight and lessen the burden of disease.
For instance, AI can analyze medical sensors and other health data to predict how likely a patient is to develop a severe blood infection. In studies it was substantially more accurate – and provided much more advance warning – than other methods. 
Another group of researchers created an AI program to sift through electronic health records of 700,000 patients. The program, called “Deep Patient,” unearthed linkages that had not been apparent to doctors, identifying new risk patterns for certain cancers, diabetes and psychiatric disorders.
AI has even powered a robotic surgery system that outperformed human surgeons in a procedure on pigs that’s very similar to one type of operation on human patients.
There’s so much promise for AI to improve people’s health that collecting medical data has become a cornerstone of both software development and public-health policy in the U.S. For example, the Obama White House launched a research effort seeking to collect DNA from at least a million Americans. The data will be made available for AI systems to analyze when studying new medical treatments, potentially improving both diagnoses and patients’ recovery.
All of these benefits from AI are available right now, and more are in the works. They do suggest that superhuman AI systems could be extremely powerful, but despite warnings from Hawking and fellow technology visionary Elon Musk that day may never come. In the meantime, as Hawking knew, there is much to be gained. AI gave him a better and more efficient voice than his body was able to provide, with which he called for both research and restraint.

Today, it boasts 800 million monthly active users and is owned by Facebook. There are 70 million photos uploaded to Instagram every day. People interact with each of those posts by showing their love with a heart, commenting and using hashtags. What all of this activity does is create an enormous amount of data. Once analyzed, by humans as well as increasingly through artificial intelligence algorithms, it can provide incredible business intel and insights into human behavior causing Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom to say, “We’re also going to be a big data company.”

Here are some ways Instagram uses big data and artificial intelligence today.
Explore Page and Search Function
Via the use of tags and trending information, Instagram users are able to find photos for a particular activity, topic or event or discover experiences, restaurants and places around the world that are trending. Enabled by tagging, the search tools help Instagram users discover things of interest among the millions of uploaded images.
PROMOTED
Target Advertising
In order to make the data that Instagram collects valuable, it must extract customer insights from it. By assessing the search preferences and engagement insights from its users, Instagram can sell advertising to companies who want to reach that particular customer profile and who might be most interested in receiving a particular marketing message. Since Facebook with 1.8 billion users owns Instagram they have a powerful network of analytics information to help target advertising based on what people like, who they follow and interact with and what they save.

Enhance the User Experience
In order to ensure users find value in the platform, it’s important for Instagram to show them what they will like. As the amount of content grows, finding content that each user will find relevant becomes exponentially more challenging. When Instagram changed its feed from reverse-chronological order to showing posts that they believe users would like and share, machine-learning algorithms were put on the job to help sort the information and to better learn over time what is most valued and relevant for each user to create a personalized feed.
Filter Spam
Instagram uses artificial intelligence to fight spam. The spam filter is able to remove fake messages from accounts written in nine languages including English, Chinese, Russian, Arabic and more. Once messages are detected they are automatically removed. Instagram uses Facebook’s artificial intelligence text analytics algorithm DeepText that is able to understand the context of a message nearly as good as humans.

Fight Cyberbullying and Delete Offensive Comments
In a survey conducted by Ditch the Label, 42% of more than 10,000 UK youth between ages 12 and 25 reported Instagram was the platform where they were most bullied. With this unfortunate distinction of having the biggest cyberbullying problem of any social media site, they became the first to use machine learning to automatically remove offensive posts, whereas Facebook and Twitter rely on users to report abusive language. Based on the success of using DeepText to identify spam and remove it, Instagram officials began to see it as a solution to identify and eliminate comments that violate Instagram’s Community Guidelines. Humans reviewed and tagged actual Instagram posts to help DeepText learn what would be considered offensive content in certain contexts and what wouldn’t be. If the algorithm finds something offensive, it is immediately removed.
Even though DeepText isn’t perfect, it has received praise from cyberbully prevention organizations for the work it is doing. There is still the risk of misclassifying something as offensive when it’s not or that offensive comments will make it through.
Study the Human Condition
In one study, 100 million Instagram photos were used to learn global clothing patterns.  What would have been an impossible amount of data to review is increasingly possible thanks to machine learning. This work showed the potential for machine learning to help extract insights when studying humans and social, economic and cultural factors around the world. This study exhibited the power of big data and technologies such as computer vision, automated analysis algorithms and machine learning to comb through enormous data sets that are created by social media sites to gain understanding about the world around us.
From enhancing its platform for users and advertisers to finding and removing fake or offensive content, Instagram uses the insights it extracts from all the data it collects to improve while others find great potential in the enormous data it collects to uncover insights about human behavior, cultures and more.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",Enterprise & Cloud,The Amazing Ways Instagram Uses Big Data And Artificial Intelligence,False,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Forbes Homepage', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Innovation', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/innovation/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Enterprise Tech', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/enterprise-tech/'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are great benefits in the use of AI and we should cherish them. However, the issue is not innovation, or the pace of technological improvement. The real problem is the governance of AI, the ethics underpinning it, the boundaries we give it and, within that, who is going to define all those.With that in mind, I think the next fight for us women is to ensure artificial intelligence does not become the ultimate expression of masculinity.There are many reasons to fear this could happen. First, the algorithms that codify human choices about how decisions should be made. It is not possible for algorithms to remain immune from the human values of their creators. If a non-diverse workforce is creating them, they are more prone to be implanted with unexamined, undiscussed, often unconscious assumptions and biases about things such as race, gender and class. What if the workforce designing those algorithms is male-dominated? This is the first major problem: the lack of female scientists and, even worse, the lack of true intersectional thinking behind the creation of algorithms.Bill Gates believes governments should tax companies’ use of robots, as a way to fund other types of employmentExamples of bias were reported by the Guardian a few years back, showing that searching Google for the phrase “unprofessional hairstyles for work” led to images of mainly black women with natural hair, while searching for “professional hairstyles” offered pictures of coiffed white women. Or take Microsoft’s Tay chatbot, which was created to strike up conversations with millennials on Twitter. The algorithm had been designed to learn how to mimic others by copying their speech. But within 24 hours of being online, it had been led astray, and became a genocide-supporting, anti-feminist Nazi, tweeting messages such as: “Hitler did nothing wrong.”What can we do about it? Obviously, encouraging more women to take up the profession and create algorithms would be a great step forward, and we are still lagging behind on this. However, we also need to start querying the outcomes of the decisions made by algorithms and demand transparency in the process that leads to them. Although the new EU General Data Protection Regulation does not go far enough, it does broaden the definition of profiling activities, thus providing us with tools to avoid profiling-based decisions by questioning them. There are no legal certainties yet about how far the new European regulations, which come into force on 25 May, can be taken, but pressure must be applied to ensure AI algorithms are not just powerful and scalable but also transparent to inspection.View image in fullscreenGoogle image searches for ‘unprofessional hair for work’ (left) and ‘professional hair for work’ (right) .Of course, the problem of AI goes beyond this. Some academics, such as Joanna Bryson and Luciano Floridi, argue that AI companies should be regulated like architects, who learn to work with city planners, certification schemes and licences to make buildings safe. They argue for watchdogs and regulators.It is encouraging that in the UK the government has set up the Centre for Data Ethics. This new body is tasked with advising on the measures needed to enable and ensure safe, ethical and innovative uses of data-driven technologies. Tech UK, which represents the tech industry, is also having conversations on the subject. For the feminist movement, the challenge is to frame the debate and not to let others decide for us.And let’s not forget the impact on the labour market, with women projected to take the biggest hits to jobs in the near future as a result of automation replacing human activities, according to the World Economic Forum. Women are more likely to be employed in jobs that face the highest automation risks. For example, 73% of cashiers in shops are women and 97% of cashiers are expected to lose their jobs to automation. The same report predicts that persistent gender gaps in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem) fields over the next 15 years will also undermine women’s professional presence.And if robots are taking human jobs, we need to figure out how we would deal with a large jobless population. Bill Gates believes that governments should tax companies’ use of robots, as a way to at least temporarily slow the spread of automation and to fund other types of employment. And many now suggest that universal basic income is probably the only solution to the rise of robotic automation. This is appealing to many but it does pose questions from a feminist perspective: if the only jobs available will be in science and technology, how is that going to work for women in the light of the gender gaps in those professions? If we followed that route, would we be paving the way to men at work and women at home?Google’s AI is being used by US military drone programmeRead moreWhat we need is a progressive, enlightened digital politics aimed at getting the most out of technology: a better environment, better healthcare, a better work-life balance. To achieve that, we need better governance of AI – and women must be at the heart of this.The Fabian Women’s Network has decided it is time to take action and throw our weight behind the cause. This month, we are launching our Women Leading in AI series. At the first gathering on 22 May, we are bringing together some of the most interesting and thought-provoking female voices on AI, ranging from business and academia to thinktanks. It is time for women not only to investigate what AI means for us, but also to make sure we frame and lead the debate about its governance and purpose, so it becomes a force for the common good and not the ultimate expression of masculine control.

DataArtificial IntelligenceInsights 5 polarizing Quotes from Professor Stephen Hawking on artificial intelligence

By Richard Gall -   March 15, 2018 - 12:00 am 37394 1 










3 min readProfessor Stephen Hawking died today (March 14, 2018) aged 76 at his home in Cambridge, UK. Best known for his theory of cosmology that unified quantum mechanics with Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity, and for his book a Brief History of Time that brought his concepts to a wider general audience, Professor Hawking is quite possibly one of the most important and well-known voices in the scientific world. 
Among many things, Professor Hawking had a lot to say about artificial intelligence – its dangers, its opportunities and what we should be thinking about, not just as scientists and technologists, but as humans. 
Over the years, Hawking has remained cautious and consistent in his views on the topic constantly urging AI researchers and machine learning developers to consider the wider implications of their work on society and the human race itself.  The machine learning community is quite divided on all the issues Hawking has raised and will probably continue to be so as the field grows faster than it can be fathomed.
Here are 5 widely debated things Stephen Hawking said about AI arranged in chronological order – and if you’re going to listen to anyone, you’ve surely got to listen to him?  
On artificial intelligence ending the human race
The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race….It would take off on its own, and re-design itself at an ever-increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn’t compete and would be superseded.
From an interview with the BBC, December 2014

On the future of AI research 
The establishment of shared theoretical frameworks, combined with the availability of data and processing power, has yielded remarkable successes in various component tasks such as speech recognition, image classification, autonomous vehicles, machine translation, legged locomotion, and question-answering systems.
As capabilities in these areas and others cross the threshold from laboratory research to economically valuable technologies, a virtuous cycle takes hold whereby even small improvements in performance are worth large sums of money, prompting greater investments in research. There is now a broad consensus that AI research is progressing steadily, and that its impact on society is likely to increase…. Because of the great potential of AI, it is important to research how to reap its benefits while avoiding potential pitfalls.
From Research Priorities for Robust and Beneficial Artificial Intelligence, an open letter co-signed by Hawking, January 2015
On AI emulating human intelligence
I believe there is no deep difference between what can be achieved by a biological brain and what can be achieved by a computer. It, therefore, follows that computers can, in theory, emulate human intelligence — and exceed it
From a speech given by Hawking at the opening of the Leverhulme Centre of the Future of Intelligence, Cambridge, U.K., October 2016
On making artificial intelligence benefit humanity
Perhaps we should all stop for a moment and focus not only on making our AI better and more successful but also on the benefit of humanity.
Taken from a speech given by Hawking at Web Summit in Lisbon, November 2017
On AI replacing humans
The genie is out of the bottle. We need to move forward on artificial intelligence development but we also need to be mindful of its very real dangers. I fear that AI may replace humans altogether. If people design computer viruses, someone will design AI that replicates itself. This will be a new form of life that will outperform humans.
From an interview with Wired, November 2017

The question is whether the people who work at those companies are willing to cooperate.On Thursday, Robert O. Work, a former deputy secretary of defense, announced that he is teaming up with the Center for a New American Security, an influential Washington think tank that specializes in national security, to create a task force of former government officials, academics and representatives from private industry. Their goal is to explore how the federal government should embrace A.I. technology and work better with big tech companies and other organizations.There is a growing sense of urgency to the question of what the United States is doing in artificial intelligence. China has vowed to become the world’s leader in A.I. by 2030, committing billions of dollars to the effort. Like many other officials from government and industry, Mr. Work believes the United States risks falling behind.“The question is, how should the United States respond to this challenge?” he said. “This is a Sputnik moment.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe military and intelligence communities have long played a big role in the technology industry and had close ties with many of Silicon Valley’s early tech giants. David Packard, Hewlett-Packard’s co-founder, even served as the deputy secretary of defense under President Richard M. Nixon.But those relations have soured in recent years — at least with the rank and file of some better-known companies. In 2013, documents leaked by the former defense contractor Edward J. Snowden revealed the breadth of spying on Americans by intelligence services, including monitoring the users of several large internet companies.ImageRobert O. Work, right, at a 2014 news conference led by Chuck Hagel, the defense secretary at the time. Mr. Work, who was the deputy secretary of defense, said of the global race for A.I. technology: “This is a Sputnik moment.”Credit...Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesTwo years ago, that antagonism grew worse after the F.B.I. demanded that Apple create special software to help it gain access to a locked iPhone that had belonged to a gunman involved in a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif.“In the wake of Edward Snowden, there has been a lot of concern over what it would mean for Silicon Valley companies to work with the national security community,” said Gregory Allen, an adjunct fellow with the Center for a New American Security. “These companies are — understandably — very cautious about these relationships.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe Pentagon needs help on A.I. from Silicon Valley because that’s where the talent is. The tech industry’s biggest companies have been hoarding A.I. expertise, sometimes offering multimillion-dollar pay packages that the government could never hope to match.Mr. Work was the driving force behind the creation of Project Maven, the Defense Department’s sweeping effort to embrace artificial intelligence. His new task force will include Terah Lyons, the executive director of the Partnership on AI, an industry group that includes many of Silicon Valley’s biggest companies.Mr. Work will lead the 18-member task force with Andrew Moore, the dean of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University. Mr. Moore has warned that too much of the country’s computer science talent is going to work at America’s largest internet companies.With tech companies gobbling up all that talent, who will train the next generation of A.I. experts? Who will lead government efforts?AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“Even if the U.S. does have the best A.I. companies, it is not clear they are going to be involved in national security in a substantive way,” Mr. Allen said.ImageAn Air Force team transporting missiles to be loaded onto drones at the Persian Gulf base in 2016.Credit...John Moore/Getty ImagesGoogle illustrates the challenges that big internet companies face in working more closely with the Pentagon. Google’s former executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, who is still a member of the board of directors of its parent company, Alphabet, also leads the Defense Innovation Board, a federal advisory committee that recommends closer collaboration with industry on A.I. technologies.Last week, two news outlets revealed that the Defense Department had been working with Google in developing A.I. technology that can analyze aerial footage captured by flying drones. The effort was part of Project Maven, led by Mr. Work. Some employees were angered that the company was contributing to military work.Google runs two of the best A.I. research labs in the world — Google Brain in California and DeepMind in London.Top researchers inside both Google A.I. labs have expressed concern over the use of A.I. by the military. When Google acquired DeepMind, the company agreed to set up an internal board that would help ensure that the lab’s technology was used in an ethical way. And one of the lab’s founders, Demis Hassabis, has explicitly said its A.I. would not be used for military purposes.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTGoogle acknowledged in a statement that the military use of A.I. “raises valid concerns” and said it was working on policies around the use of its so-called machine learning technologies.Among A.I. researchers and other technologists, there is widespread fear that today’s machine learning techniques could put too much power in dangerous hands. A recent report from prominent labs and think tanks in both the United States and Britain detailed the risks, including problems with weapons and surveillance equipment.Google said it was working with the Defense Department to build technology for “non-offensive uses only.” And Mr. Work said the government explored many technologies that did not involve “lethal force.” But it is unclear where Google and other top internet companies will draw the line.“This is a conversation we have to have,” Mr. Work said.Follow Cade Metz on Twitter: @CadeMetz.

Citizens Want Government to Use Artificial Intelligence to Deliver New, Improved Services (Graphic: Business Wire)






March 15, 2018 07:17 AM Eastern Daylight Time



ARLINGTON, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Citizens are willing to try new artificial intelligence (AI) tools for 
      government services despite their concerns about government use of the 
      technology, according to results of an Accenture (NYSE: ACN) 
      multi-country survey.
    
“These findings should be a wake-up call for 
      government leaders to prioritize effective communications regarding the 
      benefits of AI-related technology in delivering government services that 
      are secure, smart and fast — while also promoting its proper and ethical 
      use.”Post this

      The survey of more than 6,000 citizens from the United States, 
      Australia, the United Kingdom, Singapore, France and Germany found that 
      more than half (54 percent) of citizens said they are willing to use AI 
      services delivered by government, with even more expressing willingness 
      when presented with the potential benefits derived from AI.
    

      For instance, three-quarters (74 percent) of respondents said they would 
      be willing to use AI if it would increase pension or retirement income 
      (such as by improving their personal investment strategy and/or pension 
      scheme), and two-thirds (66 percent) said they would use a chatbot if it 
      would guarantee faster processing of a tax refund or social service 
      benefits.
    

      At the same time, however, the findings highlight citizens’ concerns 
      about the use of AI by governments, with two-thirds (66 percent) of 
      respondents indicating a lack of confidence in government’s ethical and 
      responsible use of AI. Specifically, only one-third (34 percent) said 
      they’re “confident/very confident” that government would be ethical and 
      responsible in its use of AI; fewer than one in three (29 percent) said 
      they are “not at all confident” in government using AI ethically and 
      responsibly, and slightly more than one-third (37 percent) said they are 
      neutral on the point.
    

      The survey also determined that regardless of where they lived, citizens 
      have concerns about the use of AI in government, including in areas of 
      job security and personal data security. For instance, approximately 
      four in 10 respondents (42 percent) said they think AI takes jobs away 
      from people, and only about one in six (17 percent) believe that AI can 
      better protect their personal information and reduce their chances of 
      getting hacked.
    

      The survey found that one of the biggest communications challenges for 
      government officials implementing AI projects is explaining AI’s 
      benefits to citizens. For instance, one-third (32 percent) of all survey 
      respondents reported not understanding AI’s potential benefits well 
      enough to judge whether government should use the technology.
    

      “Citizens are willing to embrace AI-driven solutions that improve the 
      delivery of government services, but they want to be sure that 
      government is taking a leading role in ensuring the safe and ethical use 
      of AI,” said Carl Ward, who leads AI programs for Accenture’s Health & 
      Public Service practice. “These findings should be a wake-up call for 
      government leaders to prioritize effective communications regarding the 
      benefits of AI-related technology in delivering government services that 
      are secure, smart and fast — while also promoting its proper and ethical 
      use.”
    

      The survey findings also highlight differences between citizens who work 
      in the public sector and other citizens regarding their views on AI and 
      government, with public-sector respondents being more positive overall. 
      For instance, public-sector respondents were more likely than other 
      respondents to say they are willing to use AI services delivered by 
      government (63 percent vs. 51 percent) and more likely to say they are 
      confident or very confident that government would use AI in an ethical 
      and responsible manner (46 percent vs. 31 percent). At the same time, 
      public-sector respondents were less likely to say they don’t understand 
      AI’s potential benefits well enough to judge whether government should 
      use the technology (26 percent vs. 33 percent).
    

      Public-sector respondents were also more likely than other respondents 
      to say they would be comfortable using a chatbot to interact with a 
      government agency (56 percent vs. 38 percent) — and twice as likely to 
      say they believe that using AI such as digital assistants or chatbots 
      for government services is a more secure way to protect personal 
      information (46 percent vs. 23 percent).
    

      “New categories of digital jobs are emerging that result in improved 
      government services for citizens, and citizens want government personnel 
      to explain how AI can improve the delivery of public services,” Ward 
      said. “Public-sector employees will be a critical component to bridging 
      that gap between advancing AI and engaging with citizens to address 
      concerns while also explaining the benefits. AI job coaches for 
      government personnel could provide the required skills and training 
      necessary to ensure that staff can explain the benefits of AI government 
      tools and how they can change citizen experiences for the better.”
    

Methodology


      Accenture surveyed 6,000 citizens aged 18 or older in the United States, 
      Australia, the United Kingdom, Singapore, France and Germany to assess 
      opinions about a variety of public service issues and topics. The survey 
      was conducted online between October and November 2017. Approximately 
      one-fifth (21 percent) of the respondents identified as currently 
      working in the public sector. Results for the full global sample are 
      statistically significant with a confidence level of 95% and a margin of 
      error of +/- 1.6%.

How AI is helping recruiters write the perfect job advertBy Taylor Bragg






THE recruitment market seems to be buzzing with innovation right now, and many technologies are being harnessed to find solutions to some of the toughest problems in the industry.Finding the right talent is critical for every business, although it can be a long and cumbersome one. According to research by Jobvite, 65 percent of recruiters claim talent shortage as the biggest challenge in hiring.WHAT CAN AI DO FOR THE FUTURE OF E-LEARNING?Taylor Bragg | 5 March, 2018Hiring the wrong person can be very costly for your business. According to The Times, recruiting the wrong person costs roughly a third of the employee’s first-year earnings. Not only does it cost money, but it can also negatively impact staff morale.  But now, artificial intelligence (AI) is beginning to revolutionize how recruitment professionals find the perfect candidate to fill their position. Though the technology is often referred to as dehumanizing, if used efficiently, AI can actually allow recruiters to be more, well, human!From time-saving tools which automate resume screening to AI-powered chatbots which provide 24-hour help and advice to candidates with applicant-queries, AI is set to become an essential tool for the most forward-thinking companies.AI-powered job postingsIn a world of fierce competition to nab the top talent, recruiters should not leave anything to chance. And this starts with the very first step of posting a job advert online.Though this step is often overlooked, the job advertisement is where the applicant’s journey begins. It is often the very first thing that they see from your company, and so getting this right is vital.GOOGLE’S E-LEARNING PROGRAM OPENS DOOR FOR AI TO ALLTech Wire Asia | 8 March, 2018Textio is an example of a company that truly understands the importance of high-quality job postings in recruiting the best possible candidates to join your company.How does it work?Using an “augmented writing” platform, the idea behind Textio is to give users data-driven feedback on job-postings and information on how it would likely perform with a particular audience. As a result of this, companies will be able to improve their communications and thus receive a far more favorable response.Texio uses an algorithm that ingests 10 million job openings per month. The software searches and analyzes language patterns and rates phrasing against criteria such as the number of applicants a job gets and the percentage who qualified to get an interview.Using natural language processing (NLP), the algorithms come up with alternatives to phrases to recommend ones found in the most successful job descriptions. For instance replacing “focused on” with “passionate about”.Attracting diverse candidatesAs well as this, the software can analyze how prevalent gender-biased language is in any given job posting.WHY CULTURE IS THE KEY TO SUCCESSFUL DIGITAL TRANSFORMATIONTech Wire Asia | 12 March, 2018For instance, Fortune and Textio analyzed thousands of Walmart job descriptions between January and March last year. After collecting and analyzing over 4,400 US-based job postings, it was found that 51 percent of job descriptions were more likely to appeal to men rather than women. On top of this, 53 percent of management positions and 84 percent of director-level job descriptions skew male.According to Textio, using gender-neutral language in job postings is crucial in attracting a diverse mix of talent. Such job postings are filled 14 days faster than posts which contain masculine or feminine bias.Textio is helping to rid of gender-bias within job postings. Source: ShutterstockIt seems that many companies are levering the help AI in finding the right talent. This includes major Fortune 500 companies like Cisco and Johnson & Johnson, who are using Textio to recruit better talent.It is clear that AI-powered software like Textio is a powerful tool in saving recruiters a lot of time while also helping them to find the best and diverse talent.Though, one can’t help but show a little concern about the possibility of augmented writing software like this taking over a writer’s job..

Play   Artificial intelligence finds T. rex couldn't run     
A popular YouTube artist has an unusual collaborator on her new album -- artificial intelligence.  Pop artist Taryn Southern, who appeared on American Idol in 2004, created the lyrics and melodies for ""I AM AI"" but left most of the other work to software programs.     The album's first song ""Break Free,"" which was released on Monday, was developed with the help of startup Amper Music. Amper is one of several AI music services Southern is working with on the album, which will debut later this year.   Southern has only basic piano skills, so she turned to the program to deliver the instrumental part of the song. The AI developed the harmonies, chords and sequences.   ""In a funny way, I have a new song-writing partner who doesn't get tired and has this endless knowledge of music making,"" Southern told CNN Tech. ""But I feel like I get to own my vision; I iterate and choose what I like and don't like. There's a lot more control.""       Southern still worked with a producer on her vocals, but the rest of the song relied on Amper's software. She gave the program some guidelines, such as the speed of the song, key signature and preferred instruments. The program then produced a track for her to consider.   Although some fine-tuning was still necessary after the AI delivered its part, she arranged what was offered into verses and a chorus.   ""In the past, I'd get into traps of writing songs in a given style or chords I know I like,"" Southern said. ""When working with AI music, everything it spits at me is a surprise.""   Related: Farmers turn to artificial intelligence to grow better tomatoes   Southern said writing the structure of the song is now 20 times faster than when relied on human musicians. She also previously used Apple's GarageBand platform.   Southern, known for cover songs and some original work, has been posting on YouTube for a decade. Her ""Hot for Hillary"" music video in 2007 has been viewed over 2.3 million times.        Her new work is an example of how AI can complement the human workforce, even as it automates some jobs.

At the Hiring Success 18 conference in San Francisco, SmartRecruiters unveiled an AI-powered... [+] recruiting assistant.
SmartRecruiters




The San Francisco-based recruiting startup is on a roll.
In just 3 years since launching its enterprise talent acquisition online and mobile platform, SmartRecruiters signed up 2,000 of the world's largest companies like Alcoa, Avery Dennison, Bosch, IAC, IKEA, Nature's Bounty or Visa and connected 15 million candidates to 900,000 jobs.

The 200-employee technology company also added more than 3,000 small business customers since it relaunched its free SmartStart offering, last September.
""Last year we've also added more than 200 new large enterprise customers replacing competitors like BrassRing (IBM), iCIMS, Jobvite, SuccessFactors (SAP) and Taleo (Oracle),"" said SmartRecruiters CEO Jerome Ternynck during an analyst briefing at the company's user conference, Hiring Success 18, in San Francisco this week. ""We've also doubled our revenue in 2017 with 96% of our clients renewing their subscription.""
GDPR will become a huge liability for companies using non-compliant recruiting software
The venture-backed hiring startup has raised so far over $56 million and is now available in more than 30 countries, 15 different languages and attracted over 370 partners to its cloud platform, offering additional, and sometimes competitive, services from chatbots to onboarding, CRM, social media or reference checks.
PROMOTED
""We invested heavily to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which governs the collection, use, storage and disclosure of any personal data of individuals in Europe,"" added Ternynck. ""From May, GDPR will be a huge liability as job candidates could sue any company that doesn't comply with the new law.""









SmartRecruiters AI-powered recruiting assistant helps automate the screening, discovery, and... [+] matching of job candidates, while free up recruiting capacity (4X) and save 60% of advertising and sourcing dollars.

How AI can change the future of hiring
At the Hiring Success conference, the human resources tech startup unveiled a recruiting assistant that uses machine learning to automatically screen incoming applications and score candidates against jobs, highlighting their work experiences, education level, and skill set without subjectivity or selection bias.

""We expect that AI will save recruiters 30% of their time screening candidates while the automatic scoring will reduce 50% 0f their sourcing costs by sending jobs to pre-qualified candidates,"" said Rebecca Carr, vice-president of product at SmartRecruiters. ""Another benefit of using AI for screening is that machines don't have biases which will make recruiting human again.”
With NHS, recruiting looks a lot like marketing
SmartRecruiters also announced an integrated CRM module, a new programmatic advertising solution (SmartJobs) that will optimize the posting of jobs for its customers and a scorecard to help measure a company's recruiting process, the Net Hiring Score (NHS), based on the cost and speed of hiring and the quality of the people hired.
""Similar to the Net Promoter Score (NPS) in marketing, NHS is a real-time pulse of how recruiting is performing. Organizations can also easily compare their NHS with their peers and tweak their hiring budget based on the velocity and the quality of hires they want to achieve,"" added Ternynck.
On a final note, Stephane Kasriel, the CEO of Upwork, the world's largest freelance marketplace, shared his views on the future of work, introducing the concept of total talent acquisition management embracing both the full-time workforce and freelancers.

""What has been striking to me is how the recruiting world is split today between the full time traditional W2 hiring handled by HR on one side and contingent, on-demand, temporary, consulting, freelance workers managed by the procurement department on the other. And I hope we can somehow bridge the gap so that we can start treating people like human beings and as part of the same team, and not supplies or materials.""

They can be sporadic and unpredictable. NITI Aayog’s roadmap for national Artificial Intelligence programme hopes to bring one such revolution.The allocated Rs 3,073 crore will spearhead work on fifth generation technology startups like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning (ML), Internet of Things (IoT), 3D printing and Blockchain.The magnanimity of effort can be gauged by the near doubling of the fund for the programme. Atal Innovation Mission can give Rs 10 crore to start-ups that fit the criteria. In all, Rs 200 crore has been allocated in 2017-18. India is ready to take the AI-assisted leap of faith, with pre-meditated outcomes for before, during and after the leap.The oncoming revolution has to go through mountains of paperwork, maze of data silos, and murky data lakes before any form of AI can begin to make sense of the haphazardness that is India. Let’s tackle some important questions when it comes to these futuristic technologies.Where do we stand now?The next generation of technology is seeing exponential growth. The overall picture is blurry though, due to the extremes we need to be navigating. To crunch some numbers, according to reports, there are more than 200 AI-based start-ups in India.In a March-June 2017, a Capgemini survey of nearly 1,000 companies in India with revenue of over $500 million, found that around 58 percent have gone beyond pilot and test projects and are adopting the technology at a larger scale. The number of Internet users in India is expected to reach 500 million by June 2018, it’s the second largest online market in the world.Sign up for our exclusive newsletters.Subscribe to check out our popular newsletters.* indicates mandatory fieldsAt 160 million WhatsApp users, we having a generation of people who skipped any computer learning and straightaway became mobile consumers of the internet.Let’s begin with data. AI functions are directly proportional to the amount of data and the kind of data fed into the system. In the case of India, the largest database is built with Aadhaar - 99 percent of India’s population - a staggering 1.19 billion records.Aadhaar is the world’s largest biometric ID system and India’s first foray into scaled up technology has no precedent. And this is precisely why the Aadhaar comes with its own set of unique challenges.The first challenge is how much of the data is personal? Does a collection of retinal scans and finger print breach the right of privacy? Aadhaar is mandatory for one service after another - phone numbers, ration cards, bank accounts, income tax filing. All of the interlinked data will be available to government to garner insights using AI. In the larger scheme of things, this data will be linked to hospital records, land records, purchases, this could be made visible or sold to interested parties, legally or illegally.The second challenge is of course, security. It is impossible to create a non-hackable system. Aadhaar opens up a minefield of security lapses, where the hacked data can be used to cause harm to a person or society. As pointed out by media, there have been lapses in the past wherein the data has been leaked or sold or hacked into. The government needs to make stricter laws and plug in loopholes when it comes to Aadhaar data.The third and yet unseen challenge is the moral implications of using AI, because there is no universal right or absolute wrong in this case. Every case differs from the other. This is the most difficult challenge of all, because there is limited data to study the new scenarios that will be originating when AI will be using countrywide data to garner insights.Let’s take the case of linking Aadhaar to medical records. In times of disasters, floods, fires, train accidents - fingerprint identification and medical history of a patient available to a medical profession will be the factor determining life and death. Analyzing the cases of particular diseases in a specific region, could help predict epidemics before they break out.Websites and apps query people if they are willing to share crash data with developers to better the systems over a period of time. Will hospitals give out similar consent forms to people if they are willing for their data to be used in analyzing patient records by AI to look for insights that have escaped the human eye.Personal data is a double-edged sword. Enterprises and governments can make use of data for a variety of scenarios when it helps people, but cases of blatant misuses will also be flaring up in huge numbers. Medical records of employees help an organisation in times of emergency care for employees with medical histories, like heart condition or diabetes. But the same data can be used for discriminating against employees that have a medical condition like mental health issues or HIV-AIDS.What needs to be done for enterprises to adopt AI solutions? Create secure, usable, scalable dataData is the smallest and most important unit of an AI system. AI is all set to revolutionise manufacturing, transport, healthcare, finance and retail to name a few. But, the biggest problem in India, across industry verticals, is the severe paucity of usable data. We need to create a system to convert records on paper to create data lakes for Machine Learning (ML) to take over from humans. ML will start to analyse data, and then an AI-enabled system learns by itself and provides actionable insights.The mindset needs to shift from find and fix mentality to that of a preventive maintenance.The major barriers to storing data digitally is lack of trust, time, and the inertia to shift from existing systems. Digital data is not considered tamper-proof. Take real estate for example. You have to get a stamp paper to a registrar, and get the documents in your name. For smaller transactions too, a paper bill is preferred over an email.A majority of all our transactions are physical. We need a simplified, encrypted digital transaction system that is easy to adopt. Government departments - legal, transport, medical, educational - carry majority on their transactions on paper, creating silos after silos of static, non-usable data.The existing data is not centralised, creating a disorganised data maze that is impossible to navigate. The digital revolution needs to first start creating organised, usable, accessible data. Create the ecosystem to train AI professionals Around 4,000 positions in the field of AI are vacant in India due to the insufficiency of talent. Kelly OCG India reported that India would see a 60 percent rise in demand for AI and ML professionals by 2018. It’s difficult for Indian companies to attract talent from outside the country.Educational institutes need to scale up and be better equipped for the changing demand for new technologies. A change in curriculum as well as opening new colleges, specifically dedicated to higher studies in the fields of Machine learning, Big data, Cloud computing, Blockchain and AI is the need of the day.We need to start to develop in-house talent to cater to the exceeding demand for skilled professionals.Online courses in AI and Machine Learning from industry leaders like Andrew Ng on Coursera are very helpful to companies that want their workforce to upskill and stay relevant. AI is not a magical cure for all problems Every industry has specific requirements where the use of AI can help tremendously. Manufacturing, healthcare, education, transport: every vertical gains from the use of AI. An enterprise needs to have an understanding of the timeline of the solution, resources allocated for it, financial implications and the fact that AI doesn’t always have a tangible Return on Investment in the short term.The results can often point to long-term advantages. AI can give results, there is a timeline of training the solution to be able to derive actionable insights. The learning curve is often steep.Natural Language Processing is another roadblock as the availability of NLP in any Indian language is scarce. Indian English contains words spoken colloquially and often has a mix of some words in people’s mother tongue. AI needs to train systems on the variety of colloquial terms used in Indian English.Going by the success of HDFC Bank’s chatbot, OnChat, the feat is not impossible to pull off. OnChat can effectively process a mix of Hindi and English and converse with customers to transact for bill payments, mobile recharges, booking travel etc. It has also garnered 160 percent month on month growth, garnering 2.4 million messages. Start-ups can provide better solutions for AI projectsIndia has a great scope for start-ups that work in the AI space. Due to the small size of a team of dedicated resources involved with a project, there is better coordination between the UI/UX designers, architects, developers, data scientists and the client. A smaller team also means shorter turn-around time for agile requirements of the client. Feedback can be incorporated faster into the solution. Smaller teams lead to ownership among team members who are aware of the bigger picture and their contribution to it. The absence of a defined protocol and time-taking processes leads to a fluid work environment where the client can work closely with the team working on the AI solution. InnovateThere are many start-ups in India creating chat-bots, financial solutions and medical scan solutions. But what will really give Indian companies an edge is their ability to find out AI solutions specifically suited to solve in-house problems.A NLP chatbot can bridge the language gap between the English knowing and non-English knowing population of India by having multi-language support. Using AI to recognise handwriting across different languages in India will simplify data entry and help in creating a clean data lake. Currently, most websites support the Roman keyboard, alienating millions of Indians from using the internet. Native language support on the rail bookings app will save the time and energy wasted in traveling to a railway station to book tickets.AI can create a transparent system and bring on a revolution in agriculture. Providing real time selling price of crop across nearest markets, cost-analysis of transport to farther markets, prediction for market rates in coming weeks and months, route-map for nearby storage units can all be fed into a centralised system and provided to farmers. Peer to peer discussions, best practices, weather updates, tractor rentals - there is a lot that an AI enabled solution made for India can achieve.The start-ups in India are fully aware of the shortcomings and work with it to evolve AI solutions that are India ready.Take that AI enabled leap of faithIndia is a developing nation where we are still struggling with poverty and providing food and shelter and fulfilling basic needs of being a human being. But, in prioritizing food and shelter, we haven’t put our dreams on hold.The question is, are we, as a country, ready for AI?The answer is a complex, ‘we don’t know’. But we are not going to find out, unless we go ahead and do it anyway.

They can be sporadic and unpredictable. NITI Aayog’s roadmap for national Artificial Intelligence programme hopes to bring one such revolution.The allocated Rs 3,073 crore will spearhead work on fifth generation technology startups like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning (ML), Internet of Things (IoT), 3D printing and Blockchain.The magnanimity of effort can be gauged by the near doubling of the fund for the programme. Atal Innovation Mission can give Rs 10 crore to start-ups that fit the criteria. In all, Rs 200 crore has been allocated in 2017-18. India is ready to take the AI-assisted leap of faith, with pre-meditated outcomes for before, during and after the leap.The oncoming revolution has to go through mountains of paperwork, maze of data silos, and murky data lakes before any form of AI can begin to make sense of the haphazardness that is India. Let’s tackle some important questions when it comes to these futuristic technologies.WHERE DO WE STAND NOW?The next generation of technology is seeing exponential growth. The overall picture is blurry though, due to the extremes we need to be navigating. To crunch some numbers, according to reports, there are more than 200 AI-based start-ups in India.In a March-June 2017, a Capgemini survey of nearly 1,000 companies in India with revenue of over $500 million, found that around 58 percent have gone beyond pilot and test projects and are adopting the technology at a larger scale.

Does a collection of retinal scans and finger print breach the right of privacy? Aadhaar is mandatory for one service after another - phone numbers, ration cards, bank accounts, income tax filing. All of the interlinked data will be available to government to garner insights using AI. In the larger scheme of things, this data will be linked to hospital records, land records, purchases, this could be made visible or sold to interested parties, legally or illegally.The second challenge is of course, security. It is impossible to create a non-hackable system. Aadhaar opens up a minefield of security lapses, where the hacked data can be used to cause harm to a person or society. As pointed out by media, there have been lapses in the past wherein the data has been leaked or sold or hacked into.

Will artificial intelligence and robots relieve us of humdrum tasks, making our working lives easier, or will they take our jobs away altogether? As part of a new series called the Future of Work, we look at the growing popularity of ""daigou"" - Chinese expats who buy consumer goods for people back home in China.Sandra Lee describes herself as part of a ""global phenomenon"".A 37-year-old Chinese expat who lives in Central Coast, Australia, she makes money by selling Australian goods to people back in China.Connecting with buyers via Chinese social messaging app WeChat, Ms Lee purchases items from Australian supermarkets and other retailers on their behalf, and then posts them to China.An overseas personal shopper, she is known in China as a daigou, and Ms Lee is far from alone. More than a million people globally are now working as daigou, according to some estimates.Commentators say this booming trade was born as a result of mistrust in the authenticity of products sold in China. In particular, they point to the spate of scandals involving tainted or fake baby formula milk over the last decade.Getty ImagesThere are now an estimated one million daigou around the worldIn one of the worst cases, at least six babies died back in 2008, and tens of thousands became sick, after their formula milk was found to contain melamine, a toxic compound.As a result, many people from Chinese cities greatly prefer to buy foreign brands, which have preferably been bought overseas.At a basic level, a daigou makes his or her money by charging a small fee to the people buying the products. But there are now those who have grown their businesses into mini empires.Future of WorkBBC News is looking at how technology is changing the way we work, and how it is creating new job opportunities.Staying one step ahead of the cyber-spiesIs cryonics the key to immortality?How to cope when the bots take your jobWhy Finland is experimenting with 'free money'More Future of Work storiesMs Lee, who juggles her daigou work with being a housewife, says: ""I have lots of friends selling American products such as luxury bags.""I have friends in Germany selling knives, and my classmate who now lives in Japan sells home appliances."" She explains that the phenomenon only really took off seven years ago, and is especially appealing to Chinese expats who are struggling to learn the language of their new home.""This job doesn't require you to speak any English, as long as you sell authentic products at a reasonable price,"" she says. ""You basically sell all these products to your friends, relatives or your friends' friends. It's a trust-based business."" Getty ImagesChina's 2008 baby milk scandal is said to have greatly increased demand for products bought outside the countryToday individual daigou in Australia can make upwards of $100,000 (£72,000) a year selling Australian products to customers in China.Some daigou even use their garages as their stock warehouses, and hire several people to do their customer service.AuMake, a husband-and-wife run daigou business in Sydney, has gone even further, much further. It now has a chain of physical retail stores across the city that caters to daigou shoppers. And last year it floated on the Australian stock exchange, becoming the first daigou business to list in Australia.AuMake also now has a ""daigou hub"", a space where local companies can connect directly to individual daigous and visiting Chinese tourists.It has plans to establish hubs in other capital cities as it expands. Getty ImagesDaigous in Australia have been urged not to buy up all stocks of baby formula milkBenjamin Cavender, a Shanghai-based analyst from China Market Research, says that the daigou phenomenon has been fuelled by the development of mobile phone and payment technology.""With the ubiquity of smartphones and live streaming apps it will be easy for consumers to continue to involve themselves in the idea of 're-commerce',"" he says.""The neat thing about this is that it can give a lot of power to the re-seller. An enterprising individual, who has an audience to sell to in China, can earn a lot of money.""Although these new jobs only exist because of technology developed in mobile messaging and payments applications, the skills involved are entirely human rather than automated - at least for now.Shane Oliver, chief economist at Sydney-based investment house AMP Capital, says: ""The new jobs are mainly in sourcing and authenticating the product, something that is hard for machines to do with absolute credibility.""In fact the desire for authenticity that daigous satisfy is anti-technology.""Australia-based daigous can now apply for official certificationSome of the additional tasks carried out by daigous include answering customers' queries, live-streaming on WeChat and other social media platforms, and video posting their product evaluations.""The daigous are trusted advocates on behalf of their communities in China, and their input gives it that authenticity,"" says Jessica Bragdon, co-founder of Koala Eco, an Australian cleaning product firm that sells to daigous. ""They lend a sense of trust, and people believe in it because they are representing it.""Matt McDougall, founder of marketplace Daigousales.com, is also the president of the Australia China Daigou Association, a trade body for the sector.""We get a lot of brands coming to us asking if we can get daigous to tell them about pricing, look at their products and see if they like them,"" he says.As the industry grows in Australia, new ideas are emerging to professionalise it.A number of websites now exist to help daigous do their businessThe Australia China Daigou Association is currently drawing up a code of conduct to implement a common standard of behaviour for daigous. These include not filling supermarket trolleys full of infant formula, and not leaving marks on unpurchased products in shops. ""We are looking to improve the status of this community, and bridge relationships between Australian brands and daigou buying agents,"" says Mr McDougall. The Australian government has also recently thrown its support behind the movement, recognising the job-creating potential this grey industry brings. It sent federal and state ministers to cheer the launch of the newly-formed association. However the way ahead for this new economy may not be all smooth-sailing. Professor Hans Hendrischke from the University of Sydney's Business School, cautions that China may start regulating the daigou sector, which might mean that big players will evolve and push out the smaller ones. Sandra Lee though is far more optimistic about the prospects for her job. ""The association gives you a certificate with your name on it,"" she says. ""It makes you feel like you're not doing something under the table anymore.""You start to consider this as a career and being recognised as a profession, doing something that is helping the Australian economy and also helping your friends and relatives at home to save money and get good products.""Illustration by Karen Charmaine Chanakira",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
