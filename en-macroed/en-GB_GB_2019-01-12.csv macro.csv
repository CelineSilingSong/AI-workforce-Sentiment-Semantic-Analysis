                                              Institut Montaigne, in collaboration with Ethik-IA - a French initiative feeding the debate on AI’s regulations and jurisdictions - has published a note analyzing the main impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on healthcare jobs in France. This note is intended to warn the French government on the need to anticipate AI’s impacts on jobs in the healthcare sector. Indeed, AI has the potential to deeply transform the French healthcare system as it could improve patient services, diagnostic, therapy and quality of care, while cutting costs.What is the purpose of anticipating the effects of AI on health employment?The healthcare sector has been defined as a priority sector for AI deployment by the French government. Indeed, in the Villani report of March 2018 Giving meaning to artificial intelligence (Donner un sens à l’intelligence artificielle), health is one of the 4 sectors identified as a priority along with transport, defence and environment. Health is therefore a very promising area for AI-related technologies. As such, the French government has announced the launch of the Health Data Hub, a national initiative that directly answers the double issue of data’s exploitation and protection. This hub would be a unique platform opening the access to health data for startups, medtechs, researchers, companies etc. Its main goal consists in providing conditions to improve AI innovations. Indeed, allowing AI systems to process data collection will make healthcare systems much more productive and efficient.AI in the medical sector will considerably change the way in which patients will be treated tomorrow, it is necessary to anticipate the transformation of jobs.Because the disruption induced today by AI in the medical sector will considerably change the way in which patients will be treated tomorrow (diagnosis, treatments, clinical tests, patient follow-up, etc.), it is necessary to anticipate the transformation of jobs, and thus studies as well as continuous training. For all professionals working in hospitals, it will help to define, the required skills.What are the main impacts of AI in the healthcare sector ?The impacts of AI on health employment and human resources in France have been poorly analyzed. They are difficult to assess and vary by sector: many studies focus on the impact of AI on employment in general, with very different conclusions, but none focus on the healthcare sector. A sectoral approach is necessary to get closer to the reality of jobs and properly analyse the impacts. Thus, in the healthcare sector, the main impacts are observed on the organization of hospitals as a whole, but also on the medical professions, not to mention the back office functions (e.g. medical secretary, technicians, handler).In medical research institutes, AI will increase the physician's capabilities. Indeed, some leading institutions in care and research are already developing very advanced AI projects. This is the case of the University Hospital Institute in Strasbourg, which aims to integrate AI techniques into surgical operations. Thanks to computer-assisted solutions, the Visible Patient: virtual and augmented reality project enables the creation of a 3D and personalized model of the patient before the operation. This technology simplifies the surgical procedure because the surgeon can plan his operation in advance. This 3D information is then stored to create a large database, which is very useful for the development of AI technologies in surgery and personalized medicine.In hospitals with medical shortage, AI will compensate for the absence of doctors. Indeed, some establishments outside innovation and competitiveness clusters will use AI to combat the spread of medically underserved areas and the closing of some hospitals. In 2018, France had more than 11 000 municipalities classified as territories marked by a medical shortage. AI technologies, like chatbots, remote X-ray or electrocardiograms analysis, and more broadly digital innovations such as telemedicine, could thus replace doctors where they would lacking. Indeed, assistance chatbot can be used to interview the patient remotely and analyse a possible relapse, particularly in the monitoring of psychiatric illnesses.In the healthcare sector, the main impacts are observed on the organization of hospitals as a whole, but also on the medical professions, not to mention the back office functions.In certain medical specialties, AI is already changing the way patients are cared for in the hospital. In radiology, a french startup is developing an algorithm which improves mammography screening to detect breast cancer. In cardiology, a french company has developed an extremely powerful algorithm, able to analyse electrocardiograms and improve diagnostics. In ophthalmology, the IDx-DR software developed in the United States identifies signs of diabetic retinopathy with an accuracy rate of 90 %. Needless to say that in France, with an average waiting period for an ophthalmologist appointment of 80 days, this kind of technology would definitely impact the landscape of ophthalmology. In clinical research, a french company builds mathematical models and algorithms that can interpret biomedical images, genomics and clinical data, to discover biomarkers and mechanisms associated with diseases and treatment outcomes. It will improve diagnosis and personalization of care.The medical professions are not the only ones affected by AI. The care support functions are also concerned. A very likely hypothesis would be that AI solutions, already mature and present in other sectors (management of payroll, customer files, logistics, IT support), would be deployed to the support functions of the healthcare sector. For example, computer maintenance, inventory and flow management, delivery, etc. are gradually being carried out by robots or AI software in other sectors, such as mass distribution.  At Nantes University hospital, intelligent software has the potential to save time for technical and administrative teams, in particular by optimizing the coding of hospital activity in order to anticipate patient flows. At Lyon, the University hospital has signed a partnership with Microsoft around AI. They aim to develop a vocal recognition system used during consultations, to assist medical secretaries with writing reports. The AI technology would also recognize keywords and be able to carry out a medical diagnosis.How should we anticipate these disruptions?Because AI will profoundly change medical practices and the back office function, an evolution and transformation of healthcare professions is now necessary. Indeed, it takes at least ten years to train a doctor, so we must ensure that the knowledge transmitted today will not be obsolete tomorrow. Thus, a methodology must be developed to assess the impacts on employment. The note published by Institut Montaigne and Ethik IA proposes a methodology that is divided into six steps, to determine the level of substitution by AI of each activity for a given job and then to define the rate of substitution for the job. For instance, for a medical secretary, it is possible to identify various tasks such as physical and telephone reception of patients and families, management and medico-administrative coordination, identification of patients' and families' needs and expectations, note taking, typing and document formatting, data entry related to medical activity, maintenance of patient records, etc. All these tasks must be reviewed to identify the level of substitution and then to determine whether the job would be completely or partially replaced by IA.Healthcare institutions, for instance, must anticipate the changes through the adoption of a prospective approach to the transformation of jobs.This report also promotes digital Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) as a relevant ethical framework for AI in the field of healthcare. Digital CSR can be defined as a corporate commitment, assessing societal effects induced by digital transformation. It corresponds to an ethical and responsible approach to AI. The implementation of CSR could have many benefits on the French healthcare system. It may be associated with different concrete actions that can be carried out for several actors. Healthcare institutions, for instance, must anticipate the changes through the adoption of a prospective approach to the transformation of jobs.They also have to develop evaluation methodologies of employees' skills. Employee awareness of digital issues, especially AI technologies, is particularly important. They should be trained to use existing and future technologies, in particular when their functions can be replaced by AI.Better awareness of these issues will strengthen cooperation between these actors and thus enable hospitals to integrate new technological solutions into their healthcare provision, in order to improve patient care.PrintSharerelated content

In February 2017, AvalonBay’s 235-unit development in Maplewood, New Jersey, burned down six weeks before its planned opening. The homebuilder rebuilt the $55 million project from scratch—then searched for new ways to prevent fires, a constant threat when building with woodframe construction. The solution: Pillar Technologies, whose devices monitor temperature, smoke and other signs of pending disaster, and which will soon use artificial intelligence to flag environmental risks even earlier.


“It’s like medical monitoring for buildings,” says Michael Feigin, chief construction officer and executive vice president at AvalonBay. 

How Algorithms Are Taking Over Big Oil

AI Is About To Take The Ship's Helm From Humans

PROMOTED
Construction is a giant industry and, until recently, had struggled to adopt technology. That is changing. New York City-based startup Pillar is one of a number of companies trying to apply artificial intelligence to construction and engineering, using predictive analytics to do everything from preventive maintenance to work schedule optimization.
These types of tools aren’t likely to remain on job sites. Sensors and real-time video that collect data and AI that analyzes this information could lead to safer, more comfortable homes and workplaces.
“AI is being added to everything,” says Matt Joyal, Pillar’s chief technology officer. “This is where technology is going. We have so much data. Why don’t we use it to make job sites efficient and safe?”

Pillar's Matthew Joyal (l) and Alex Schwarzkopf (r) hold the wireless devices that collect data ... [+] about conditions at construction sites. “One of the challenges with AI and machine learning is you need good data to build models,” Schwarzkopf says.Jamel Toppin
Alex Schwarzkopf, Pillar’s chief executive, founded the company with Joyal and a third friend while still in college in 2015 to address a giant gap in construction-site safety. Manual ways of keeping sites safe–with human fire watches, for example–weren’t as efficient or foolproof as they needed to be. Pillar’s rugged yellow, wireless devices can flag all sorts of troubles on construction sites before they become multimillion-dollar messes or cause injuries to people. They can identify leaks, which can result in mold, and determine the level of particulates like silica, which can be harmful to construction workers.
The founders raised $3.6 million in funding and signed dozens of clients nationwide, including the World Trade Center in New York. Revenue is expected to reach at least $4 million this year, still small, but Pillar’s plans for predictive analytics should help growth accelerate. “Alex’s business is taking risk out of the system,” says Martha Notaras, a partner at XL Innovate, the venture division of insurance giant AXA and an investor in Pillar.
Schwarzkopf, 27, and his cofounders originally intended to build a sports helmet that could measure impacts and determine concussion risk. But athletes didn’t want to wear it, they couldn’t get funding and the project died. That failed startup eventually led to Pillar after a friend in construction management suggested they transfer the technology to hard hats.
In meetings with construction managers about that new idea, one building exec asked them if they could monitor temperature or humidity to help prevent mold growth and construction defects. Their existing device couldn’t do any of those things, but Schwarzkopf and his cofounders seized the opportunity. “We were like, ‘Give us four months, and we’ll build that,’” he recalls.
They scrambled and built an early version of the Pillar device that they could demonstrate to Gilbane, a large construction firm. The first prototype looked rough, a bunch of wires shoved into two blue electrical boxes. Yet durability, rather than looks, proved the steeper hurdle. In an early meeting with a potential customer, a construction manager threw the device across the room and watched as it smashed into pieces to illustrate just how tough the product would need to be.
Schwarzkopf and Joyal figured out how to build a more rugged, wireless product with a battery that could last for months. Builders can now put dozens of its industrial-grade sensors on their construction sites and leave them there through rain and wind to monitor potentially destructive conditions and send emergency alerts as need be.
All that information provides the data for a planned AI system. The devices include seven different sensors to monitor temperature, humidity, dust, particulates, air pressure, ambient light and carbon monoxide. “What we’ve been doing is some basic anomaly detection. We are looking for outliers,” Joyal says. “This year, we’re going to see how far we can push machine learning to get our customers better insights into their buildings.”
Over time, as Pillar gathers more data from its own sensors, it will be able to model the data more dynamically to predict, for example, at what point a pipe is likely to freeze on the first floor with the door open in 30-degree temperatures versus on the third floor where temperatures are higher to allow drywall installation. “If it is raining outside, the threshold for when a fire might start is different,” Joyal says. Predictive modeling will allow Pillar to take such differences into account–and as Pillar sucks up more data in its devices, the models will get smarter over time. Pillar eventually could consider both building-to-building differences—perhaps allowing it to rate a developer’s 25 construction sites based on their riskiness—and regional differences.
Someday, Pillar’s devices might even stay in the buildings once they’re constructed, sending off details about their environments to a central system, which could keep monitoring for potential problems. Asked about that, Schwarzkopf smiles. “It’s funny you’re asking that,” he says, “because I have a lot of people asking me to do that.”

We are currently experiencing a wave of disruptive technologies centered around recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things, big data, robotics, nanotechnology, advanced materials, and 3D/4D printing. Welcome on board the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR).Until now we have gone through three such revolutions. The first was the introduction of steam power at the end of the 18th century that mechanized production. The second comprised the widespread development of electricity at the beginning of the 20th century that allowed mass production. The third was the advent of information technology (IT) in the 1970s that introduced automated production. The fourth one builds on the infrastructure provided by the third revolution to launch us into the wave we are currently experiencing.The impact of the 4IR is massive as it integrates several disruptive technologies. It is already affecting our personal lives and is set to completely transform the  petroleum industry business.Recent articles (Robinson, 2018; Ighalo et al., 2018) give a high level insight into the importance of utilizing the massive amount of data available in the petroleum industry today and building data analytics capabilities around the evolution of IT infrastructure. Even though AI has been applied in other fields for more than 4 decades, its application in the petroleum industry has been sparse and limited.This article will give a succinct overview of the AI paradigm, discuss the challenges in applying AI in the petroleum industry, highlight some of the emerging opportunities and prospects, and conclude with recommendations to accelerate the admission of AI into workflows.AI 101My favorite definition for AI is the one proposed by a Stanford University Professor, John McCarthy: “The science and engineering of making intelligent systems.” It should be known that those “intelligent systems” could be hardware (e.g., robotic arms during some repetitive jobs like capping drink bottles), software (e.g., algorithms that recognize patterns), or a combination of both (e.g., autonomous rovers that make independent decisions based on certain events).AI could not have existed without computers. Therefore, the discussion on the history of AI would not be complete without looking at the history of computers. Some computer-like developments  started as early as 1800. The first electronic computer, ENIAC, was developed in the early 1940s. This facilitated the arrival of the first commercially stored program later in the decade around 1949. With this success, more programming languages were rolled out in quick succession: LISP language in mid-1950s followed by PROLOG in early 1970s, when the first expert system was revealed. With this strong foundation, more advanced programming languages have evolved over time and continue to the present day.The words “artificial intelligence” were first mentioned at a conference in 1956. Leveraging the capability to program computers, the new field of AI rapidly developed. This assisted the development of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) along with other variants such as Generalized Regression Neural Networks, Radial Basis Function Neural Networks, Probabilistic Neural Networks, and Cascaded Neural Networks. AI became a multi-million dollar business with the introduction of AI-based hardware in 1986 and started to be incorporated in military systems and games in the early 1990s.The news of an AI machine (Deep Blue) beating a human chessmaster (Garry Kasparov) came in 1997. There was a massive launch of AI-based products, both software and hardware, by companies such as Apple, Google, and Microsoft from 2010. Advanced machine learning (ML) concepts such as hybrids, ensembles, and deep learning followed rapidly to accelerate the application of automatic image classification and object recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks. Since the middle of this decade, extensive deep learning applications have been developed and actively supported by improved and advanced hardware capabilities to handle the complexities of the applications.The next section attempts to clear the confusion around the terms data science, computational intelligence, AI, and neural networks.Clearing the ConfusionPeople outside the data science community have used the terms: data science, computational intelligence, AI, and neural networks, interchangeably. AI is not a “technique.” It is a branch of computer science that covers other sub-fields such as Natural Language Processing, Expert Systems, Robotics, and Computational Intelligence. CI, also known as soft computing or neural computing, combines knowledge discovery (KD), pattern recognition, and data mining processes to develop ML workflows.Some of the various techniques that can be used for ML are ANN and its variants, Decision Tress, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Extreme Learning Machine, Fuzzy Logic Types I and II, Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (popularly mentioned in the literature by its abbreviation ANFIS), and Nearest Neighbors. This new and rapidly evolving field that uses various scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms, either structured or unstructured, is called data science.It is also necessary to clarify the relationship among KD, data mining, and ML.Knowledge Discovery, Data Mining, and Machine LearningThe KD process is a collection of tasks and procedures that are used to extract knowledge or meaningful insight from data. It starts with identifying a challenge.The type of challenge determines the data to use. This is the data selection phase. For example, if you need to predict reservoir porosity, you would need petrophysical data, among others, rather than geochemical. The selected data usually needs to be preprocessed to remove anomalies, outliers, noise, and other artifacts. Based on the statistical evaluation of the selected data, it might be necessary to apply some transformation functions such as log normalization or resampling on the data. This is the point data mining comes in.The most common among the possible data mining techniques is ML (discussed below). The result of data mining is a recognized pattern. The pattern will be interpreted, evaluated, and validated to generate a new insight that can be added to the organizational workflow. The KD process is summarized in Fig 1.Fig. 1—The knowledge discovery process workflow. Overview of Machine LearningThe main tool used for data mining is ML. In simple terms, ML can be defined as the process of teaching computers to do what humans naturally do without being explicitly programmed. Through ML, algorithms are able to continuously learn from historical events captured in data and adaptively improve their predictive capabilities with more data.There are three ML methods: supervised, unsupervised, and hybrid learning. Supervised ML algorithms learn patterns from historical examples. This is called training. The trained model is able to predict the target variable given new input instances. An example is to use the relationship between wireline logs and reservoir properties from historical data to predict the properties of a new reservoir given new input scenarios. Typical applications of this learning method are regression and classification.Unsupervised ML algorithms make inferences from events depicted by data without prior classification or label. They infer a function, usually based on some distance metrics, to describe a hidden structure from unlabeled data. From this result, an expert can derive meanings that can lead to new insights.An example is to use historical log data to compartmentalize a reservoir into sections based on certain signatures such as the density of data points. An expert may then interpret the sections as different lithologies. A typical application of this learning method is clustering.Hybrid ML algorithms combine supervised and unsupervised methods to arrive at a solution in situations where there are uncertainties in human knowledge. They have the capability to considerably improve learning accuracy with limited labels. An example of this is to use a clustering approach to compartmentalize a huge volume of reservoir data into sizeable zones before applying regression or classification.In summary, ML enables analysis of massive quantities of data. While it generally delivers faster and more accurate results to identify profitable opportunities or dangerous risks, it may also require considerable amount of time and resources to train it properly. The main objective of ML is to maintain a balance between underfitting and overfitting. The traditional ML workflow is shown in Fig 2.

 When To Use Machine Learning?At this point, I am sure that readers would begin to wonder about when to use ML. The following guidelines are helpful:No existing rule/equation. If there is an established relationship among certain parameters that can be accurately defined by an equation, then there is no need for ML. For example, we know that the distance traveled is directly proportional to speed and inversely to time. This is universally established. Using ML to predict distance from speed and time will be useless. Investigating the relationship between log measurements and reservoir permeability would be a good candidate for ML.Rules and equations are too complex. When a set of rules or an equation is based on very complex and confusing assumptions, then consider using ML.Rules are constantly changing. When relationships change due to various conditions, then consider using ML. For example, when some relationships that are valid for clastic reservoirs become invalid in carbonates, then ML can be used to derive a complex relationship in both environments.The nature of data keeps changing. If the nature of data keeps changing such that the fundamental principles of the underlying equations are no more honored, then ML might be useful to establish a nonlinear dynamic mapping to handle the change.Large amount of data. Small datasets can be modeled easily using basic statistical functions. As data volume increases, ML may become necessary. This is the reason AI has now become synonymous with “big data.”Challenges and Limitations of Machine LearningML has been around for more than 4 decades, but until recently, not much progress has been made in its adoption in the oil and gas industry. The applications have been isolated and sparse. The following could be the reasons:It requires substantial data. Having access to large enough historical dataset to ensure effective model training and generalization capability has been a major challenge.Poor quality data. Even when some data are available in sufficient volume, the quality may be questionable. Poor quality data produces poor quality predictions. This will remind us of the “garbage in, garbage out” maxim. Dr. Pedro Domingo of the University of Washington said “Machine learning can’t get something from nothing … what it does is get more from less.”The learning process requires a degree of expertise. Most users of ML in the industry simply go with the default parameter settings in those packages. ML is an art in itself and hence needs to be mastered. It goes beyond simply running the ANN app over a dataset. There are technicalities involved in choosing the right features, tuning the model parameters, trying different learning algorithms and activation functions, and possibly carrying out certain post-processing activities to enhance the output and presentation of the process.Focus on pattern in data rather than the physics of the problem. One of the possible reasons petroleum industry experts would not easily accept the ML paradigm is the focus of the latter on extracting patterns in data rather than incorporating the physics of the problem. This will continue to pose a challenge until there is a very close collaboration between data scientists and domain experts to leverage the strength of both parties.Recommendations for Successful Application in Oil and GasGiven the challenges outlined above, below are a few tips and recommended best practices for successfully adopting ML in the petroleum industry. I hope this will help avoid some of the common pitfalls that organizations and ambitious users might be vulnerable to while starting their ML-driven projects. :Spend enough time on data quality assurance. Given the robustness of the model, good data determines the quality of the results. Most of the time when algorithms don’t perform well, it is due to a problem with the training data such as insufficient amount, skewed data, noisy data, or insufficient features describing the data for making decisions.Choose the right features that describe the problem to be solved. This process is domain-specific and hence should be done in close collaboration with domain experts rather than being left completely to data scientists.Seek to understand ML techniques rather than using them as black boxes. Each ML technique has its own science forming the foundation.Make the products of ML projects easy to use. Invest enough time to build user-friendly and simple user interfaces. A process that can be executed in a few clicks is better and will be easily adopted by consumers than those that are complicated.Build integrated solutions to form a suite. Rather than building ML applications around small and narrow problems, think of a “one-stop shop” type solutions.Invest time in learning. When a MLalgorithm is not working, we often feed the machine with more data. This can lead to issues with scalability, in which we have more data but not enough time to invest in the “learning” process.ML is not a magic wand. It may not be able to solve all problems. Handle ML projects with a focus on clear set of objectives driven by knowledge of the possibilities and limitations of the ML paradigm. Attempting to use it as a blanket solution that must work in all situations seldom works.This article has been written with the objective of providing a basic understanding of AI, its relevant terminology, and the rudiments of how it works. I hope that I have succeeded in infusing the “AI thinking” in the minds of the readers and tickled your interest in looking for opportunities to apply ML in your projects.ReferencesRobinson, D.

You’ve been trying to work things out together in couples’ counselling, but ultimately, you want to know if it is worth the effort. Will things get better, or are they doomed to fall apart?It might be worth just pausing for a second to listen to your partner. Really listen. When you speak to each other, your voices hold all sorts of information that could reveal the answer. Subtle inflections in tone, the pauses between phrases, the volume at which you speak – it all conveys hidden signals about how you really feel.You might also like: • The key to unlocking lost languages • The musicians without ears • What single word defines who you are?A lot of this we pick up on intuitively. We use it to fine-tune the meaning of our words. Think of the difference between these questions:“Why are you here?”“Why are you here?”“Why are you here?”That shift in emphasis is one of the more obvious ways we layer our speech with meaning. But there are many more layers that we add without realising it.But there is a way to extract this hidden information from our speech. Researchers have even developed artificial intelligence that can then use this information to predict the future of couples’ relationships. The AI is already more accurate at this than professionally trained therapists.Getty ImagesSome features of human speech cannot be picked up by our ears, but they can reveal how we really feel about someone (Credit: Getty Images)In one study, researchers monitored 134 married couples who had been having difficulties in their relationships. Over two years, the couples each recorded two 10-minute problem-solving sessions. Each partner chose a topic about their relationship that was important to them and discussed them together. The researchers also had data on whether or not the couples’ relationships improved or deteriorated and if they were still together two years later.  Trained therapists watched videos of the recordings. By assessing the way the couples spoke to each other, what they said and how they looked while they were talking, the therapists made a psychological assessment about the likely outcome of their relationship.The researchers also trained an algorithm to analyse the couples’ speech. Previous research had given the team some clues that certain features were likely to be involved in human communication, such as intonation, speech duration and how the individuals took turns to speak. The algorithm’s job was to calculate exactly how these features were linked to relationship strength.The algorithm also picked up on features of speech beyond human perceptionThe algorithm was purely based on the sound recordings, without considering visual information from the videos. It also ignored the content of their conversations – the words themselves. Instead, the algorithm picked up on features like cadence, pitch and how long each participant talked for.Amazingly, the algorithm also picked up on features of speech beyond human perception. These features are almost impossible to describe because we’re not typically aware of them – such as spectral tilt, a complex mathematical function of speech.“Using lots of data, we can find patterns that may be elusive to human eyes and ears,” says Shri Narayanan, an engineer at the University of Southern California, who led the study.After being trained on the couples’ recordings, the algorithm became marginally better than the therapists at predicting whether or not couples would stay together. The algorithm was 79.3% accurate.Getty ImagesOur voices reveal more about our thoughts and emotions than we are able to pick up with our human ears (Credit: Getty Images)The therapists – who had the advantage of also being able to understand the content of the couples’ speech and watching their body language – came in at 75.6% accurate.“Humans are good at decoding many pieces of information,” says Narayanan. “But we can’t process all aspects of information available.”The idea is that we are ‘leaking’ more information about our thoughts and emotions than we, as humans, can pick up on. But algorithms are not just restricted to decoding the voice features that people tend to use to convey information. In other words, there are other ‘hidden’ dimensions to our speech that can be accessed by AI.“One the advantages of computers is their ability to find patterns and trends in large amounts of data,” says Fjola Helgadottir, a clinical psychologist at the University of Oxford. “Human behaviour can give insight into underlying mental processes,” she says.“However, machine learning algorithms can do the hard work of sorting through, finding pertinent information, and making a prediction about the future.”An algorithm that predicts whether or not your relationship is doomed may not be the most appealing idea. Especially as it is only three-quarters accurate, at present. Such a prediction could conceivably change the course of your relationship and how you feel about your partner.Cracking the information hidden in the way we talk &ndash; and in how our bodies function &ndash; could be used to make our relationships betterBut cracking the information hidden in the way we talk – and in how our bodies function – could be used to make our relationships better.Theodora Chaspari, a computer engineer at Texas A&M University, has been developing an AI program that can predict when conflict is likely to flare up in a relationship. Chaspari and her colleagues used data from unobtrusive sensors – like a wrist-worn fitness tracker – that 34 couples wore for a day.Getty ImagesMachine learning is able to pick up information from the way we speak rather than the words we use to make predictions about how a relationship might last (Credit: Getty Images)The sensors measure sweat, heartrate and voice data including tone of voice, but also analysed the content of what the couples said – whether they used positive or negative words. A total of 19 of the couples experienced some level of conflict during the day that they wore the sensors.Chaspari and her colleagues used machine learning to train an algorithm to learn the patterns associated with arguments that the couples reported having. After being trained on this data, the algorithm was able to detect conflict in other couples using just the data from the sensors, with an accuracy of 79.3%.Now the team is developing predictive algorithms that they hope to use to give couples a heads-up before an argument is likely to take place by detecting the warning signs that lead up to one.By monitoring your perspiration levels, heart rates and the way you&rsquo;ve been speaking, the algorithm would make a calculation of how likely it is that you&rsquo;ll face friction with your partnerThe way the authors foresee it working is like this: you’ve had a busy day at work, perhaps had a stressful meeting, and you’re on your way home. Your partner has also had a tough day. By monitoring both of your perspiration levels, heart rates and the way you’ve been speaking in the past hours, the algorithm would make a calculation of how likely it is that you’ll face friction with an equally exasperated partner when you get home.“At this point, we can intervene in order to resolve the conflict in a more positive way,” says Chaspari.This could be done by simply sending a message to couples before the moment heats up, says Adela Timmons, a psychologist on the project based at the Clinical and Quantitative Psychology Center for Children and Families at Florida International University.“We think that we can be more effective in our treatments if we’re able to administer them in people’s real lives at the points that they need them most,” she says.The traditional model of therapy isn’t capable of fulfilling that goal. Typically, a session might take place for an hour a week, when the patients recall what happened since the last session, and talk through problems that arose.“The therapist isn’t able to be there in the moment when someone actually needs the support,” says Timmons. “There are a lot of steps in the traditional process where the intervention can break down and be less effective.”Getty ImagesMonitoring for factors that might increase the risk of a couple having an argument would allow an AI to head off rows before they happen (Credit: Getty Images)But an automated prompt based on consistently monitoring people’s physiology and speech could fulfil the real-time dream of therapy intervention. It could also allow for a more standardised form of treatment, says Helgadottir.“Nobody really knows what goes on in a closed therapy room,” says Helgadottir, who has developed an evidence-based platform using AI to treat social anxiety. “Sometimes the most effective techniques aren’t being used since they require more effort on the part of the therapist. On the other hand, the clinical components of AI therapy systems can be completely open and transparent.“They can be designed and reviewed by the leading researchers and practitioners in the field. Furthermore, computers don’t have off days, and there is no difference if 1, 100 or 1,000 users are benefitting at the same time.”There are potential pitfalls though. There’s no guarantee that a ping from your phone warning of an impending argument won’t backfire and wind you up even more. The timing of the intervention is crucial.If we can catch people in the period where it's starting to escalate but they haven't lost their capacity to regulate their behaviour, that's the sweet spot of intervention - Adela Timmons“We probably don’t want to actually intervene during a conflict, says Timmons. “If people are already upset, they aren’t going to be terribly receptive to prompts on their phone that they should calm down. But if we can catch people in the period where it’s starting to escalate but they haven’t lost their capacity to regulate their behaviour – that’s the sweet spot of intervention.”There are plenty of technological hurdles left to overcome before an app like this can be rolled out. The team needs to refine its algorithms and test their efficacy on a wider range of people. There are also big questions around privacy.Getty ImagesCouple's who want to work on their relationship could benefit from the power of prediction that AI brings (Credit: Getty Images)A data breach of a device storing data on your relationship with your partner would put a lot of sensitive information at risk. One could also question what would happen to the data if there was an alleged crime, such as domestic violence.“We have to think about how we would handle those situations and ways to keep people safe while protecting their privacy,” says Timmons. “Those are wider social issues that we will continue to discuss.”If this model of therapy is indeed successful, it could also open doors to similar ways to improve other kinds of relationships – such as within the family, at work, or the doctor-patient dynamic. The more that our different bodily systems are monitored – from our eye movements to our muscle tension – the more could be revealed about what is in store for our relationships. There may prove to be many more layers of meaning, beyond our speech and basic physiological reactions, that can best be decoded by machines.Join 900,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Instagram.If you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called “If You Only Read 6 Things This Week”.

How advanced is AI today? 











Facial and emotional recognition; how one man is advancing artificial intelligence
12:49

Despite what you hear about artificial intelligence, machines still can't think like a human, but in the last few years they have become capable of learning. And suddenly, our devices have opened their eyes and ears and cars have taken the wheel. Today, artificial intelligence is not as good as you hope and not as bad as you fear, but humanity is accelerating into a future that few can predict. That's why so many people are desperate to meet Kai-Fu Lee, the oracle of AI.Kai-Fu Lee is in there, somewhere, in a selfie scrum at a Beijing Internet Conference. His 50 million social media followers want to be seen in the same frame because of his talent for engineering and genius for wealth.60 Minutes Overtime: China's greatest natural resource may be its dataScott Pelley:  I wonder, do you think people around the world have any idea what's coming in artificial intelligence? 






Kai-Fu Lee: I think most people have no idea, and many people have the wrong idea.Scott Pelley: But you do believe it's going to change the world?


Kai-Fu Lee: I believe it's going to change the world more than anything in the history of mankind. More than electricity.Lee believes the best place to be an AI capitalist is communist China. His Beijing venture capital firm manufactures billionaires.
Kai-Fu Lee in a scrum of selfie seekers
Kai-Fu Lee: These are the entrepreneurs that we have funded.He's funded 50 AI start-ups. 


Kai-Fu Lee: We have about ten billion-dollar-companies here.Scott Pelley: Ten, $1 billion-companies that you funded?Kai-Fu Lee: Yes, including a few $10 billion-companies.In 2017, China attracted half of all AI capital in the world. One of Lee's investments is Face++, not affiliated with Facebook. Its visual recognition system smothered me to guess my age. It settled on 61 which was wrong. I wouldn't be 61 for days. On the street, Face++ nailed everything that moved. It's a kind of artificial intelligence that has been made possible by three innovations: super fast computer chips, all the world's data now available online, and a revolution in programming called ""deep learning."" Computers used to be given rigid instructions. Now they're programmed to learn on their own.Kai-Fu Lee: In early days of AI, people try to program the AI with how people think. So, I would write a program to say, ""Measure the size of the eyes and their distance. Measure the size of the nose. Measure the shape of the face. And then, if these things match, then this is Larry and that's John."" But today, you just take all the pictures of Larry and John and you tell the system, ""Go at it. You figure out what separates Larry from John.""Let's say you want the computer to be able to pick men out of a crowd and describe their clothing? Well, you simply show the computer ten million pictures of men in various kinds of dress. That's what they mean by deep learning. It's not intelligence so much. It's just the brute force of data having ten million examples to choose from.So, Face++ tagged me as male, short hair, black long sleeves, black long pants. It's wrong about my gray suit and this is exactly how it learns. When engineers discover that error, they'll show the computer a million gray suits and it won't make that mistake again. 


Another recognition system we saw, or saw us, is learning not just who you are but how you feel.Scott Pelley: Now what are all the dots on the screen? The dots over our eyes and our mouths?Songfan Yang: The computer keeps track of all the feature points on the face.Songfan Yang developed this for TAL Education Group, which tutors 5 million Chinese students. 

Scott Pelley: Well let's look at what we are seeing here now. According to the computer, I'm confused, which is generally the case. But when I laughed I was happy. That's amazing.Songfan Yang: Exactly.The machine notices concentration or distraction to pick out for the teacher those students who are struggling or gifted.


Scott Pelley: It can tell when the child is excited about math?Kai-Fu Lee: Yes.Scott Pelley: Or the other child is excited about poetry?Kai-Fu Lee: Yes. Scott Pelley: Could these AI systems pick out geniuses from the countryside?Kai-Fu Lee: That's possible in the future. It can also create a student profile and know where the student got stuck so the teacher can personalize the areas in which the student needs help.""AI will increasingly replace repetitive jobs. Not just for blue-collar work but a lot of white-collar work.""We found Kai-Fu Lee's personal passion in this spare Beijing studio. He's projecting top teachers into China's poorest schools. This English teacher is connected to a class 1,000 miles away in a village called Duh-Fang.


Many students in Duh-Fang are called 'left behinds' because their parents left them with family when they moved to the cities for work. Most 'left behinds' don't get past ninth grade. Lee is counting on AI to deliver for them the same opportunity he had when he immigrated to the U.S. from Taiwan as a boy.Kai-Fu Lee: When I arrived in Tennessee, my principal took every lunch to teach me English. And that is the kind of attention that I've not been used to growing up in Asia. And I felt that the American classrooms are smaller, encouraged individual thinking, critical thinking. And I felt it was the best thing that ever happened to me.And, 'the best thing that ever happened' to most of the engineers we met at Lee's firm – they too are alumni of America – with a dream for China.

Scott Pelley: You have written that Silicon Valley's edge is not all it's cracked up to be. What do you mean by that?Kai-Fu Lee: Well, Silicon Valley has been the single epicenter of the world technology innovation when it comes to computers, internet, mobile and AI. But in the recent five years, we are seeing that Chinese AI is getting to be almost as good as Silicon Valley AI. And I think Silicon Valley is not quite aware of it yet.China's advantage is in the amount of data it collects. The more data, the better the AI. Just like the more you know, the smarter you are. China has four times more people than the United States who are doing nearly everything online.Scott Pelley: I just don't see any Chinese without a phone in their hand.


College student Monica Sun showed us how more than a billion chinese are using their phones to buy everything, find anything and connect with everyone. In America, when personal information leaks, we have congressional hearings. Not in China.Scott Pelley: Do you ever worry about the information that's being collected about you where you go what you buy who you're with?Monica Sun: I never think about it.Scott Pelley: Do you think most Chinese worry about their privacy?Monica Sun: Not that much.Scott Pelley: Not that much.With a pliant public, the leader of the Communist Party has made a national priority of achieving AI dominance in ten years. This is where Kai-Fu Lee becomes uncharacteristically shy. Even though he's a former Apple, Microsoft and Google executive, he knows who's boss in China. 






Why China is the ""Saudi Arabia"" of data
01:30

Scott Pelley: President Xi has called technology the sharp weapon of the modern state. What does he mean by that?


Kai-Fu Lee: I am not an expert in interpreting his thoughts. I don't know.Scott Pelley: There are those, particularly people in the west who worry about this AI technology as being something that governments will use to control their people and to crush dissent.Kai-Fu Lee: As a venture capitalist, we don't invest in this area, and we're not studying deeply this particular problem.Scott Pelley: But governments do.Kai-Fu Lee: It's certainly possible for governments to use the technologies, just like companies.Lee is much more talkative about another threat posed by AI. He explores the coming destruction of jobs in a new book, ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order.""Kai-Fu Lee: AI will increasingly replace repetitive jobs. Not just for blue-collar work but a lot of white-collar work.


Scott Pelley: What sort of jobs would be lost to AI?Kai-Fu Lee: Basically chauffeurs, truck drivers anyone who does driving for a living their jobs will be disrupted more in the 15 to 20 year time frame and many jobs that seem a little bit complex, chef, waiter, a lot of things will become automated we'll have automated stores, automated restaurants, and all together in 15 years, that's going to displace about 40 percent of the jobs in the world.Scott Pelley: Forty percent of the jobs in the world will be displaced by technology?Kai-Fu Lee: I would say displaceable.Scott Pelley: What does that do to the fabric of society?Kai-Fu Lee: Well, in some sense there is the human wisdom that always overcomes these technology revolutions. The invention of the steam engine, the sewing machine, electricity, have all displaced jobs. And we've gotten over it. The challenge of AI is this 40 percent, whether it is 15 or 25 years, is coming faster than the previous revolutions. 






What data does China have on its citizens?
02:06

There's a lot of hype about artificial intelligence, and it's important to understand this is not general intelligence like that of a human. This system can read faces and grade papers but it has no idea why these children are in this room or what the goal of education is. A typical AI system can do one thing well, but can't adapt what it knows to any other task. So for now, it may be that calling this ""intelligence,"" isn't very smart.


Scott Pelley: When will we know that a machine can actually think like a human?Kai-Fu Lee: Back when I was a grad student, people said, ""If machine can drive a car by itself, that's intelligence."" Now we say that's not enough. So, the bar keeps moving higher. I think that's, I guess, more motivation for us to work harder. But if you're talking about AGI, artificial general intelligence, I would say not within the next 30 years, and possibly never.Scott Pelley: Possibly never? What's so insurmountable?Kai-Fu Lee: Because I believe in the sanctity of our soul. I believe there is a lot of things about us that we don't understand. I believe there's a lot of love and compassion that is not explainable in terms of neural networks and computation algorithms. And I currently see no way of solving them. Obviously, unsolved problems have been solved in the past. But it would be irresponsible for me to predict that these will be solved by a certain timeframe.Scott Pelley: We may just be more than our bits?Kai-Fu Lee: We may.Produced by Guy Campanile and Andrew Bast


Editor's Note: In an earlier version of this story, we stated that Kai-Fu Lee has funded 140 artificial intelligence start-ups. The correct number is 50.

And that is the kind of attention that I've not been used to growing up in Asia. And I felt that the American classrooms are smaller, encouraged individual thinking, critical thinking. And I felt it was the best thing that ever happened to me.And, 'the best thing that ever happened' to most of the engineers we met at Lee's firm – they too are alumni of America – with a dream for China.Scott Pelley: You have written that Silicon Valley's edge is not all it's cracked up to be. What do you mean by that?Kai-Fu Lee: Well, Silicon Valley has been the single epicenter of the world technology innovation when it comes to computers, internet, mobile and AI. But in the recent five years, we are seeing that Chinese AI is getting to be almost as good as Silicon Valley AI. And I think Silicon Valley is not quite aware of it yet.China's advantage is in the amount of data it collects. The more data, the better the AI. Just like the more you know, the smarter you are. China has four times more people than the United States who are doing nearly everything online.Scott Pelley: I just don't see any Chinese without a phone in their hand.College student Monica Sun showed us how more than a billion chinese are using their phones to buy everything, find anything and connect with everyone. In America, when personal information leaks, we have congressional hearings. Not in China.Scott Pelley: Do you ever worry about the information that's being collected about you where you go what you buy who you're with?Monica Sun: I never think about it.Scott Pelley: Do you think most Chinese worry about their privacy?Monica Sun: Not that much.Scott Pelley: Not that much.With a pliant public, the leader of the Communist Party has made a national priority of achieving AI dominance in ten years. This is where Kai-Fu Lee becomes uncharacteristically shy. Even though he's a former Apple, Microsoft and Google executive, he knows who's boss in China. Scott Pelley: President Xi has called technology the sharp weapon of the modern state. What does he mean by that?Kai-Fu Lee: I am not an expert in interpreting his thoughts. I don't know.Scott Pelley: There are those, particularly people in the west who worry about this AI technology as being something that governments will use to control their people and to crush dissent.Kai-Fu Lee: As a venture capitalist, we don't invest in this area, and we're not studying deeply this particular problem.Scott Pelley: But governments do.Kai-Fu Lee: It's certainly possible for governments to use the technologies, just like companies.Lee is much more talkative about another threat posed by AI. He explores the coming destruction of jobs in a new book, ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order.""Kai-Fu Lee: AI will increasingly replace repetitive jobs. Not just for blue-collar work but a lot of white-collar work.Scott Pelley: What sort of jobs would be lost to AI?Kai-Fu Lee: Basically chauffeurs, truck drivers anyone who does driving for a living their jobs will be disrupted more in the 15 to 20 year time frame and many jobs that seem a little bit complex, chef, waiter, a lot of things will become automated we'll have automated stores, automated restaurants, and all together in 15 years, that's going to displace about 40 percent of the jobs in the world.Scott Pelley: Forty percent of the jobs in the world will be displaced by technology?Kai-Fu Lee: I would say displaceable.Scott Pelley: What does that do to the fabric of society?Kai-Fu Lee: Well, in some sense there is the human wisdom that always overcomes these technology revolutions. The invention of the steam engine, the sewing machine, electricity, have all displaced jobs. And we've gotten over it. The challenge of AI is this 40 percent, whether it is 15 or 25 years, is coming faster than the previous revolutions. There's a lot of hype about artificial intelligence, and it's important to understand this is not general intelligence like that of a human. This system can read faces and grade papers but it has no idea why these children are in this room or what the goal of education is. A typical AI system can do one thing well, but can't adapt what it knows to any other task. So for now, it may be that calling this ""intelligence,"" isn't very smart.Scott Pelley: When will we know that a machine can actually think like a human?Kai-Fu Lee: Back when I was a grad student, people said, ""If machine can drive a car by itself, that's intelligence."" Now we say that's not enough. So, the bar keeps moving higher. I think that's, I guess, more motivation for us to work harder. But if you're talking about AGI, artificial general intelligence, I would say not within the next 30 years, and possibly never.Scott Pelley: Possibly never? What's so insurmountable?Kai-Fu Lee: Because I believe in the sanctity of our soul. I believe there is a lot of things about us that we don't understand. I believe there's a lot of love and compassion that is not explainable in terms of neural networks and computation algorithms. And I currently see no way of solving them. Obviously, unsolved problems have been solved in the past. But it would be irresponsible for me to predict that these will be solved by a certain timeframe.Scott Pelley: We may just be more than our bits?Kai-Fu Lee: We may.Produced by Guy Campanile and Andrew BastEditor's Note: In an earlier version of this story, we stated that Kai-Fu Lee has funded 140 artificial intelligence start-ups.

While computer software can help recruiters sift through piles of applications faster, companies are under pressure to make sure they don’t discriminate against older workers. Looking for a solution, employers are turning to artificial intelligence (AI) as one way to give everyone a fair chance at jobs.

The average length of time a recruiter spends on each résumé for a job opening is six seconds, according to several studies of human resource officers. Because it’s difficult to make an informed decision so quickly, many companies use software to initially screen candidates based on keywords in their résumés or applications. But advocates for older workers have raised concerns about how these tools might digitally discriminate against older workers. 








Some of the basic uses of recruiting technology already have ended up in court, facing complaints of age bias. For example, one lawsuit alleges that PricewaterhouseCoopers denied older workers job opportunities in part by discarding applications if the candidates did not have email accounts ending in “.edu,” which are university accounts commonly used by students and recent college grads but are less common among older alumni. Another technology-based lawsuit claims that employers were using Facebook to advertise job postings only to younger people.








“This would mean the methods of discrimination have changed and its tools now include algorithms, dropdown boxes and pattern recognition — but those are tools that can help older Americans rather than deny opportunity,” AARP Executive Vice President Nancy LeaMond says of the social media lawsuit.

As these cases work their way through the courts, tech companies and human resources managers are starting to consider ways software can be used to reduce the unintended biases that cause employers to overlook talented candidates. One approach involves using AI, which basically is software that is programmed to think rather than simply react. Last month, IBM added new features to its Watson technology — the computer of Jeopardy! fame — specifically designed to help employers recognize potential biases in their hiring patterns that they might otherwise miss. The company uses AI to analyze the backgrounds of diverse current employees who are great at their jobs. The artificial intelligence then uses that information to identify applicants with similar qualities. By looking for matches in abilities rather than keywords in a résumé, the program aims to go beyond typical recruiting technology. “The result is a stronger workplace that is more diverse, fosters fresh perspectives, and promotes an inclusive atmosphere free of bias,” says Bob Schultz, general manager of IBM’s Watson Talent Solutions. It’s worth noting that IBM has been criticized for potential age bias in its layoff process. But companies that have used versions of the Watson technology for recruiting, including BuzzFeed Media and H&R Block, say the use of artificial intelligence has helped them find good candidates faster. “We want our recruiters to focus on the most value-add activities, and we believe AI can make the recruiting and hiring process incredibly efficient and fair,” says Katie Waldo, talent acquisition operations manager for H&R Block. And while Watson won on the Jeopardy! TV show, other technologies are bringing games into the hiring process. The specially designed video games are supposed to give employers a better indication of how well candidates think on their feet than a résumé or other list of accomplishments would. For example, Unilever asks some of its candidates to spend roughly a half-hour playing games on a computer or mobile device. The 13 games are designed to reveal the candidates’ personalities, problem-solving skills and communication style. Applicants who do well advance to the next step in the hiring process. According to a report from the consulting firm Deloitte Insights, games are one of the approaches recruiters are using to attract young candidates. But many of today’s older workers grew up playing Pong, Pac-Man and Donkey Kong decades ago. While technology has become more sophisticated, many of the skills it takes to play today’s games are essentially the same. And the ability to apply skills to new challenges is one of the most highly sought-after qualities in job candidates, regardless of age.",Companies are starting to use technology to address discrimination in hiring,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['WebPage'],Age Discrimination,,,,,,

When we think about robots, it’s usually in the context of their relationships with humans. Some are friendly, like Rosie the Robot from “The Jetsons” — a bizarre juxtaposition of futuristic technology and 1950s gender roles. Then there’s R2D2, whose impressive skills are punctuated with adorable beeps and chirps.Some robots are destructive — like the Terminator, programmed to go back in time to kill. Or the Cylons from “Battlestar Galactica,” cybernetic beings that try to wipe out the entire human race.It makes sense to consider robots in relation to humans, because robots are created by people, for people. Yet outside of movies and books, it’s easy to get caught up in advancing the technological prowess of robots without thinking about the human element. We need them to work with us, not against us, or even simply apart from us.“Often when you start thinking about these technologies, the human kind of gets lost in the shuffle,” said Nancy Cooke, a professor of human systems engineering at Arizona State University’s Polytechnic School. “People need to be able to coexist with this technology.”Helping people and technology collaborate well is no easy feat. That’s why researchers across ASU are teaming up to help people, robots and artificial intelligence work together seamlessly.

“One of the first things you worry about is team composition. I think it’s an important question to consider who’s doing what on the team,” Cooke said. “We need to make sure the robots are doing what they’re best suited for and the humans are doing what they’re best suited for. You have (robots) doing tasks that either the human doesn’t want to do, it’s too dangerous for the human to do, or that the AI or robot is more capable of doing.”Cooke is a cognitive psychologist by training. She has spent years working to understand human teamwork and decision-making. Now she applies this expertise to human-technology teams as director of ASU’s Center for Human, Artificial Intelligence, and Robot Teaming (CHART), a unit of the Global Security Initiative.CHART is providing much-needed research on coordinating teams of humans and synthetic agents. Their work involves everything from how these teams communicate verbally and nonverbally, to how to coordinate swarms of robots, to the legal and ethical implications of increasingly autonomous technology. To accomplish this, robotics engineers and computer scientists work closely with researchers from social sciences, law and even the arts.What can human-robot teams do? There are lots of applications. Scientists can explore other planets through rovers that don’t need air and water to survive. Swarms of drones could carry out search-and-rescue missions in dangerous locations. Robots and artificial intelligence (AI) can assist human employees in automated warehouses, on construction sites or even in surgical suites.Teaching teamwork“One of the key aspects of being on a team is interacting with team members, and a lot of that on human teams happens by communicating in natural language, which is a bit of a sticking point for AI and robots,” Cooke said.She is working on a study called the “synthetic teammate project,” in which AI (the synthetic teammate) works with two people to fly an unmanned aerial vehicle. The AI is the pilot, while the people serve as a sensor operator and navigator.The AI, developed by the Air Force Research Laboratory, communicates with the people via text chat.

“So far, the agent is doing better than I ever thought it would,” Cooke said. “The team can function pretty well with the agent as long as nothing goes wrong. As soon as things get tough or the team has to be a little adaptive, things start falling apart, because the agent isn’t a very good team member.”Why not? For one thing, the AI doesn’t anticipate its teammates’ needs the way humans do. As a result, it doesn’t provide critical information until asked — it doesn’t give a “heads up.”“The whole team kind of falls apart,” Cooke said. “The humans say, ‘OK, you aren’t going to give me any information proactively, I’m not going to give you any either.’ It’s everybody for themselves.”A need for information is not the only thing people figure out intuitively. Imagine that you are encountering a new person. The person approaches you, looks you in the eye and reaches out his right hand.Your brain interprets these actions as “handshake,” and you reach out your own arm in response. You do this without even thinking about it, but could you teach a robot to do it?Heni Ben Amor, an assistant professor in the School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems Engineering, is trying to do just that. He teaches robots how to interact with people physically by using machine learning. Machine learning is how computers and AI learn from data without being programmed.“It’s really about understanding the other and their needs, maybe even before they are uttering them. For example, if my coworker needs a screwdriver, then I would probably pre-emptively pick one up and hand it over, especially if I see that it’s out of their range,” Ben Amor said.

His team uses motion-capture cameras, like the one in an Xbox Kinect. It’s an inexpensive way to let the robot “see” the world. The robot observes two humans interacting with each other, playing table tennis or assembling a set of shelves, for instance. From this, it learns how to take on the role of one of the people — returning a serve or handing a screw to its partner.“The interesting part is that no programming was involved in this,” Ben Amor noted. “All of it came from the data. If we wanted the robot to do something else, the only thing we need to do is go in there again and demonstrate something else. Instead of getting a PhD in robotics and learning programming, you can just show the movement and teach the robot.”


Designing droidsLance Gharavi also works with the physical interactions between humans and robots, but he is not a roboticist. He is an experimental artist and professor in the School of Film, Dance and Theatre. He has been integrating live performance and digital technologies since the early '90s.Several years ago, Gharavi was asked to create a performance with a robot in collaboration with Srikanth Saripalli, a former professor in ASU’s School of Earth and Space Exploration.“I think one of my first questions was, ‘Can he juggle?’ And Sri said, ‘No.’ And I said, ‘Can he fail to juggle?’ And Sri said, ‘Yes, spectacularly!’ I said, ‘I can work with that,’” Gharavi said.Gharavi’s team put together a piece called “YOU n.0,” which premiered at ASU’s Emerge event. Afterward, Saripalli told Gharavi that the collaboration had advanced his research and asked to continue the partnership.“It was primarily about trying to understand the control structures and mechanisms for the Baxter robot platform,” explained Gharavi, referring to an industrial robot with an animated face created by Rethink Robotics. “They weren’t really sure how to work with it. My team created a means of interfacing with the robot so that we could operate it in a kind of improvisational environment and make it function.”For example, the team created a system called “the mirror,” in which the robot would face a person and mirror that person’s movements.“What we were interested in doing is creating a system where the robot could move like you, but not just mimicking you. So that you could potentially use the robot as, say, a dance partner,” Gharavi said.His goal is to give robots some of the “movement grammar” that people have. Or to put it more simply, to make a robot move less robotically.





“I have a pretty voracious curiosity. I’m interested in all kinds of things. I tend to like big ideas and big stories, which is one of the reasons I’m interested in science and religion and philosophy. Those are the places where we keep our biggest ideas and our biggest stories,"" Lance Gharavi said. Photo by Deanna Dent/ASU

“If we’re looking forward to a day when robots are ubiquitous, and interacting with robots is a common experience for us, what do we want those interactions to look like? That takes a degree of design,” he explained.Such a future may also require people to adjust their perceptions and attitudes. Cooke’s team conducted an experiment in which they replaced the AI pilot with a person but told the other two teammates that they were working with a synthetic agent. She says they treated the pilot differently, giving more commands with less polite interaction.“Everything we saw from how they were interacting indicated that they weren’t really ready to be on a team with a synthetic agent. They still wanted to control the computer, not work with it,” Cooke said.In a twist on the experiment, the researchers inserted a human teamwork expert into the AI pilot role. This person subtly guided the other humans on the team, including asking for information if it wasn’t coming in at the right time. The collaboration was much more effective.Cooke’s team continues to work with the Air Force Research Laboratory to improve the synthetic teammate and test it in increasingly difficult conditions. They want to explore everything from how a breakdown in comprehension affects team trust to what happens if the AI teammate gets hacked.Assisting autonomyCooke is also collaborating with Spring Berman, associate director of CHART, on a small-scale autonomous vehicle test bed. As driverless-car technology advances, these vehicles will have to safely share the road with each other, human-driven cars, pedestrians and cyclists.Some of the miniature robotic “cars” in the test bed will be remotely controlled by people, who will have a first-person view of what’s happening as if they are really driving a car. Other vehicles will operate autonomously. The team wants to explore a wide range of potential real-world scenarios.





Spring Berman studies robot swarms. She often collaborates with scientists who study animals that work in groups, such as ants. In college she worked with a professor studying underwater glider vehicles. ""She was looking at how fish school. I thought it was a really interesting concept to use principles from nature to design controllers for robots.” Photo by Jessica Hochreiter/ASU

“Autonomous vehicles will generally obey all the rules. Humans are a little more flexible. There’s also the issue of how do humans react to something that’s autonomous versus human-driven. How much do they trust the autonomous vehicle, and how does that vary across ages?” Berman asked.She is an associate professor in the School for Engineering of Matter, Transport and Energy who primarily studies robot swarms. She says that CHART allows her to consider her technical work in a broader context.“You’re so focused on proving that the swarm is going to do something that you design it to do. In reality, the robots will be operating in an uncertain environment that’s changing. There are things you can’t control, and that’s very different from a simulation or lab environment. That’s been eye-opening for me, because you’re so used to testing robot swarms in controlled scenarios. And then you think, ‘Well, this might actually be operating out in the world. How will we keep people safe? How are they going to benefit from this? What are the legal issues?’” Berman asked.According to Ben Amor, robots still have a long way to go before they operate truly autonomously in a safe way. Currently, machine learning is mostly used in domains where making a mistake is not costly or dangerous. An example is a website that recommends products to buy based on your past choices.

Ben Amor notes that robots aren’t good at executing a series of interdependent actions yet. For instance, if a car turns left, it is now on a new street. Any decision it makes now will be dependent on that last decision.“If you’re learning, that means you have to explore new things. We need to allow the robot to try things it’s never done before. But if you do that, then you also run the risk of doing things that adversely affect the human,” he said. “That’s probably the biggest problem we have right now in robotics.”In his research, he is exploring how to ensure that this continual learning process is actually safe before conducting those kinds of experiments.What it means to be humanIf the idea of robots continually learning and acting autonomously is a bit unnerving to you, you are not alone. That is why, as ASU researchers work on perfecting the technology of robots and AI, they collaborate with humanities scholars and artists like Gharavi.“We can’t go blithely forward, just making and creating, without giving some thought to the implications and ramifications of what we’re doing,” Gharavi said. “That’s part of what humanities people do, is think about these sorts of things.”Gharavi is collaborating with Cooke and Berman on the autonomous vehicle test bed. His role is to create the environment that the cars will operate in, a city for robots that he calls “Robotopolis.”

“What I and some designers I’m working with are creating will be something on the order of a large art installation, that will at once be a laboratory for research and experiments in robotics and also an artistic experience for people that come into the space — an occasion for meditation on technology and the future, and also history,” he explained.Gharavi says what fascinates him about working with robotics and AI is the way it forces us to explore what it really means to be human.“We understand robots as kind of the ultimate ‘other.’ Whatever they are, they are the opposite of human. They are objects that specifically lack those qualities that make us as humans special. At least that’s the way we have framed them,” he said.“Through that juxtaposition, it’s a way of engaging with what it means to be alive, what it means to be sentient, what it means to be human. What it means to be human has always been up for debate and negotiation. Significant portions of the population of this country were once not considered humans. So the meaning of human has changed historically,” he continued.Scholars in the arts, humanities and social sciences have a lot to offer scientists and engineers studying robotics. Cooke says ASU’s interdisciplinary approach to robotics and AI sets the university apart from others. It also brings its own set of challenges, just like human-robot collaboration.“Again you have the communication problem. The language that people who do robotics speak is not necessarily the same kind of language that we speak when we’re talking about human interaction with the robots,” noted Cooke, who chaired a committee on the effectiveness of team science for a National Academies study.“Multidisciplinary team science can be really challenging, but it also can be really rewarding,” she said about her work with CHART. “Now I feel like I’m living the dream.”Written by Diane Boudreau.
