        8 insights boards should know about artificial intelligence

            By David Geer

People and leadership skillsTechnology and analytics










Many businesses are only beginning to experiment with artificial intelligence (AI). But once fully embraced, the technology — which combines powerful computers, algorithms, and big data — has the potential to quickly transform workplaces.
Early adopters, such as tech giants Google and Amazon, are investing in AI to optimise searches and personalise marketing. Automakers are using AI to develop self-driving vehicles. And the financial services industry is looking to improve customers’ experience with the help of AI.
The more companies use the technology, the more potential for revenue and market share growth they see in it, according to a 2017 survey by consulting company McKinsey. The survey also suggests that successful adoption of AI requires strong leadership support. Add to that changes in how work is being done, and AI becomes a topic boards of directors may want to track, according to PwC.
To keep up with AI developments and their effects on businesses, boards should consider the following:
AI will require organisational retooling. Effective AI systems are driven by multidisciplinary teams whose members come together to solve a problem. Organisational retooling should break down silos that separate data into cartels and employees into isolated units.
Workforce upskilling will support a more collaborative approach to working and teach employees new skills.
AI-savvy employees don’t just need to know how to choose the right algorithm and feed data into a model. They’ll also have to know how to interpret the results. They’ll need to know when to let the algorithm decide and when to step in.
“While AI will provide useful insights for decision-making, employees can’t assume that AI will always be right,” said Alex Lattner, ACMA, CGMA, head of finance at the Deutsche Cyber Sicherheitsorganisation in Berlin, an organisation founded in 2015 to improve cybersecurity in German industry. “Human talent will evaluate and, if needed, overwrite the results of AI for various reasons. The database AI relies on might be biased and lead to unrealistic or unwanted outcomes.”
Boards should likewise take charge of AI. “Boards should regularly challenge AI outcomes to align them with corporate goals, targets, and strategy,” Lattner said.
AI will amplify human potential. More than half of about 500 executives surveyed by PwC last year said AI tools implemented in their businesses have increased productivity.
Tools already available can automate complex processes, identify trends in historical data to create business value, and provide forward-looking intelligence to strengthen human decisions.
“For example, AI might discover relationships like the impact of certain customer groups on total sales,” Lattner said. “Boards need to understand, challenge, and benefit from these insights to increase profitability.”
AI’s most powerful benefits are often indirect, and businesses may need new kinds of metrics to measure returns on investment, such as freeing employees from repetitive tasks or improving human decision-making.
AI will help the business do a lot more with big data. To make use of AI tools that can process data quickly, such as supervised machine learning and deep learning, enormous amounts of data must be standardised, labelled, and cleaned of biases and anomalies.
“Boards should therefore not be tempted to use AI regardless of the market they are in and the size of their business just because it is a major trend and they want to be part of it,” Lattner said. “AI makes no sense if you have, for example, just a handful of customers and act in a niche market.”
Only if the benefits exceed costs should a business move forward, because AI tools will most likely require a business to reform its data architecture and governance.
Functional specialists will guide AI customisation to ensure it supports the business use case. To customise an AI application for a specific business area, the computer scientists creating the application will need functional specialists, such as economists, financial analysts, or traders, to figure out the best design. Once the application is up and running, functional specialists will have to customise and tweak the technology.
The business must apply the sound judgement of the specialists who will use and benefit from AI to ensure it fits the specific use case. The company must first quell specialists’ concerns over potential job loss due to AI to get them on board, Lattner suggested.
“We can’t ignore the fact that these same specialists are afraid of losing their jobs with the introduction of AI-based processes,” he said. “Management must address these fears. Specialists and finance staff must be certain about their careers.”
One way to do that is to provide functional specialists with some basic understanding of AI.
Cyberattacks and cyber defence will leverage AI. The more AI advances, the more its potential for cyberattacks grows.
A US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) competition, the Cyber Grand Challenge, examined how to program AI systems to safeguard computer networks. Anti-virus companies are looking to AI to detect software anomalies. Hackers who create viruses are looking at how to keep virus scanners from seeing their malicious software, too.
“Boards need to be aware of this evolution and put their organisation in a position where they can protect sensitive data and react accordingly when an attack happens. From a finance position, this also implies the provision of corresponding budgets and headcount,” Lattner said.
To heighten cybersecurity, businesses should augment the data and compute platforms that support advanced analytics with privileged access monitoring, source code reviews, and expanded cybersecurity controls.
People will need to “look under the bonnet” of AI. The algorithms at the core of AI are often very complex or labelled trade secrets. Users who do not understand how AI arrives at a certain decision may not trust the technology.
Regulators will pass along pressure from consumers to companies that create and use AI, and they, in turn, will likely have to share some details of AI’s secret sauce. “This is true on the regulatory side in some parts of the world, where regulations require it,” said Pavan Udayagiri, ACMA, CGMA, manager, corporate finance and internal audit, at Grupo Kaybee, an international trading company, in Singapore.
Most AI algorithms can be understood, but if every step must be documented and explained, the process takes longer and becomes more expensive. A framework to assess business, performance, regulatory, and reputational concerns can balance the trade-off.
Countries will compete for AI market share. World governments are increasingly interested in AI market share and the leverage it will grant their countries and economies. By 2030, AI is projected to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy.
“AI being one of the more powerful tools that humanity is going to experience (in this generation), there will be competition among countries for market share,” Udayagiri said.
World leaders in AI development include the UK, Canada, Japan, Germany, and, particularly, China. About one-quarter of AI’s economic contribution is projected to be realised in China.
“China has a huge AI player in [technology company] Baidu. As far as China is concerned, they use AI for surveillance. The combination of AI and totalitarian regimes is concerning,” Lattner said.
There will be pressure to use AI responsibly. As AI affects decisions impacting people’s lives and careers, such as loan decisions, for example, the question of responsible use will become increasingly important, said Lattner. “Europe has adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), effective May 25, 2018, dealing partly with the implications of AI on people and their right to get more information about their data and how organisations use it.”
Because AI will evolve faster than regulations and public awareness that pertain to AI, companies need to be proactive.
“Regarding AI, their biggest asset is trust,” Lattner said. Customers need to be confident about the quality and results of decisions that emanate from AI insights. In communicating with stakeholders, boards need to strike a balance between maintaining their competitive advantage — that is, keeping the “secret” of AI methods — and satisfying the legitimate interest of stakeholders in understanding the implications of AI use.

When Mark Zuckerberg told Congress Facebook would use artificial intelligence to detect fake news posted on the social media site, he wasn’t particularly specific about what that meant. Given my own work using image and video analytics, I suggest the company should be careful. Despite some basic potential flaws, AI can be a useful tool for spotting online propaganda – but it can also be startlingly good at creating misleading material.


This sure looks like Barack Obama saying some things he probably would never say.

Researchers already know that online fake news spreads much more quickly and more widely than real news. My research has similarly found that online posts with fake medical information get more views, comments and likes than those with accurate medical content. In an online world where viewers have limited attention and are saturated with content choices, it often appears as though fake information is more appealing or engaging to viewers.
The problem is getting worse: By 2022, people in developed economies could be encountering more fake news than real information. This could bring about a phenomenon researchers have dubbed “reality vertigo” – in which computers can generate such convincing content that regular people may have a hard time figuring out what’s true anymore.
Detecting falsehood
Machine learning algorithms, one type of AI, have been successful for decades fighting spam email, by analyzing messages’ text and determining how likely it is that a particular message is a real communication from an actual person – or a mass-distributed solicitation for pharmaceuticals or claim of a long-lost fortune.
Building on this type of text analysis in spam-fighting, AI systems can evaluate how well a post’s text, or a headline, compares with the actual content of an article someone is sharing online. Another method could examine similar articles to see whether other news media have differing facts. Similar systems can identify specific accounts and source websites that spread fake news.
An endless cycle
However, those methods assume the people who spread fake news don’t change their approaches. They often shift tactics, manipulating the content of fake posts in efforts to make them look more authentic. 
Using AI to evaluate information can also expose – and amplify – certain biases in society. This can relate to gender, racial background or neighborhood stereotypes. It can even have political consequences, potentially restricting expression of particular viewpoints. For example, YouTube has cut off advertising from certain types of video channels, costing their creators money.
Context is also key. Words’ meanings can change over time. And the same word can mean different things on liberal sites and conservative ones. For example, a post with the terms “WikiLeaks” and “DNC” on a more liberal site could be more likely to be news, while on a conservative site it could refer to a particular set of conspiracy theories. 
Using AI to make fake news
The biggest challenge, however, of using AI to detect fake news is that it puts technology in an arms race with itself. Machine learning systems are already proving spookily capable at creating what are being called “deepfakes” – photos and videos that realistically replace one person’s face with another, to make it appear that, for example, a celebrity was photographed in a revealing pose or a public figure is saying things he’d never actually say. Even smartphone apps are capable of this sort of substitution – which makes this technology available to just about anyone, even without Hollywood-level video editing skills.
Researchers are already preparing to use AI to identify these AI-created fakes. For example, techniques for video magnification can detect changes in human pulse that would establish whether a person in a video is real or computer-generated. But both fakers and fake-detectors will get better. Some fakes could become so sophisticated that they become very hard to rebut or dismiss – unlike earlier generations of fakes, which used simple language and made easily refuted claims.
Human intelligence is the real key
The best way to combat the spread of fake news may be to depend on people. The societal consequences of fake news – greater political polarization, increased partisanship, and eroded trust in mainstream media and government – are significant. If more people knew the stakes were that high, they might be more wary of information, particularly if it is more emotionally based, because that’s an effective way to get people’s attention.
When someone sees an enraging post, that person would do better to investigate the information, rather than sharing it immediately. The act of sharing also lends credibility to a post: When other people see it, they register that it was shared by someone they know and presumably trust at least a bit, and are less likely to notice whether the original source is questionable.
Social media sites like YouTube and Facebook could voluntarily decide to label their content, showing clearly whether an item purporting to be news is verified by a reputable source. Zuckerberg told Congress he wants to mobilize the “community” of Facebook users to direct his company’s algorithms. Facebook could crowd-source verification efforts. Wikipedia also offers a model, of dedicated volunteers who track and verify information.
Facebook could use its partnerships with news organizations and volunteers to train AI, continually tweaking the system to respond to propagandists’ changes in topics and tactics. This won’t catch every piece of news posted online, but  it would make it easier for large numbers of people to tell fact from fake. That could reduce the chances that fictional and misleading stories would become popular online.
Reassuringly, people who have some exposure to accurate news are better at distinguishing between real and fake information. The key is to make sure that at least some of what people see online is, in fact, true.

Future Tense is a  partnership of Slate, New America, and Arizona State  University that examines emerging technologies, public policy, and society.
  

What do Suda the elephant and e-David the robot have in common? Both are capable of creating beautiful paintings, free(ish) of human intervention—one uses its trunk to clutch the brush, the other a mechanical arm (though whether Suda is truly “free” when she paints is a matter of serious contention). Each can even sign their work. The quality of their paintings does vary slightly, though of course, beauty is in the visual sensor of the beholder. Suda, who lives in a Thai elephant camp, paints self-portraits, simple outlines of elephants and trees, while e-David, a German robot, paints portraits of others with detailed shading, strokes tailored even down to the choice of brush. Despite their artistic differences, e-David and Suda have another thing in common: dubious rights to legal authorship of the fruits of their labor. Neither is able to hold copyright under current U.S. law.

For Suda, this seems unlikely to change. A long-running legal dispute over the creative ownership of a monkey’s selfie saw a loss for animal-kind last week, with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissing a copyright infringement lawsuit by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals on behalf of the animal. The selfie, which Naruto the crested macaque snapped in 2011 with a camera belonging to wildlife photographer David Slater, has been the subject of multiple lawsuits, with PETA recently attempting to claim Naruto is its true author—and therefore entitled to profits. It might be over for “Naruto’s” claim, however. The lawsuit had already been settled in Slater’s favor in a lower court, and it was reconfirmed, with the court ruling that copyright can only be claimed on behalf of humans.

In the time that the monkey selfie case has been ongoing (it even has its own Wikipedia page) the U.S. Copyright Office has re-emphasized the requirement of “human authorship” in intellectual property claims, updating its guidelines to explicitly rule out monkey selfies and elephant murals. According to the Next Web, some experts were looking to this latest court ruling as an important precedent in the non-human rights arena, with PETA lawyers claiming that “any law passed (or not) in Naruto’s favor could reflect the rights of other non-human entities.” Other non-human entities includes robots—because for now, bots don’t have intellectual property rights, either.

We apparently ascribe more value to chips and circuits than to flesh and blood.

But when it comes to A.I., the craftsmanship and creativity of the “non-human entity” is quickly surpassing that of animals (sorry, Suda)—potentially even reaching levels at which copyright consideration may be necessary. As John Frank Weaver once noted in Future Tense, robots are excelling in the creative fields, painting, writing, and composing original work, and they’ve only matured since then, writing novels and even poems. All this raises significant questions for copyright law. Do we want to protect the “intellectual property” of artificial intelligence?

Some have suggested that yes, we do. As Paresh Kathrani points out in the Conversation, intellectual property law is designed to recognize intelligence and incentivize progress—if we don’t give robots IP rights, some argue, we are failing to protect the value we give intelligence, In failing to recognize and appropriately reward complex work, even that done by robots, we dis-incentivize it, potentially slowing down human (?) progress to boot. Many experts, including Weaver, advocate for other forms of robot rights—from the right to free speech to the right to citizenship—especially as they gain sentience.

It’s not clear yet what rights we may eventually ascribe to robots. But it is clear that robots are in with a better shot at these rights than animals. No one outside of PETA is particularly up in arms about the anti-Naruto ruling—in fact, PETA has been portrayed as something of a joke in the coverage and by the courts. Robot rights, meanwhile, are being taken very seriously. While U.S. copyright can currently only be held by “legal persons,” this may not rule out robots for long. The EU is considering creating a specific category of personhood just for bots, meaning they may be eligible even without a change in IP law (though these overlapping jurisdictions are going to be messier than Suda’s handwriting). Others have suggested that if not robots, copyright benefits could instead flow to their owners or creators—copyright by human proxy.

What does it say about us as a species that we are more comfortable conferring privileges to machines than to non-human­–but-still-living beings? We apparently ascribe more value to chips and circuits than to flesh and blood, and we seem we more willing to listen to vested interests than to animal interests. Is it fear of Roko’s Basilisk that keeps us deferring to bots? Perhaps, as Nathan Heller suggests in this New Yorker essay, we feel—irrationally—as uncomfortable with robot cruelty as we do with animal cruelty because robot minds are made in our own image. This makes us better at anthropomorphizing bots than monkeys, despite our shared DNA with the latter. Or perhaps, in this case, it’s economics. Robots are themselves intellectual property. Time, thought, and human intelligence went into A.I., into making it capable of making valuable work—humans still want to reap the benefits of their creation’s creations. An A.I. developer wants in on the profits of a critically acclaimed, robot-penned novel—or maybe he just wants to write the sequel.
If we grant property rights to robots, humans (or at least some humans) win. The rights of the robot are ultimately the rights of the creator. But apparently if we grant rights to animals, humans—like David Slater—lose. And if there’s one thing humans like to do, it’s win.

                  Terrorism
                













There is a general tendency among counterterrorism analysts to understate rather than hyperbolize terrorists’ technological adaptations. In 2011 and 2012, most believed that the “Arab Spring” revolutions would marginalize jihadist movements. But within four years, jihadists had attracted a record number of foreign fighters to the Syrian battlefield, in part by using the same social media mobilization techniques that protesters had employed to challenge dictators like Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, Hosni Mubarak, and Muammar Qaddafi.Militant groups later combined easy accessibility to operatives via social media with new advances in encryption to create the “virtual planner” model of terrorism. This model allows online operatives to provide the same offerings that were once the domain of physical networks, including recruitment, coordinating the target and timing of attacks, and even providing technical assistance on topics like bomb-making.» Subscribe to our new, weekly podcast Defense One Radio! Episode 2 begins here.Many analysts—and I fell prey to this error—brushed aside early concerns about the global diffusion of drone technology. The reason? We imagined that terrorists would use drones as we did, and believed that superior American airpower would blast theirs from the sky. But instead of trying to replicate the Predator, the Islamic State and other militant groups cleverly adapted smaller drones to their purposes. In the 2017 battle for Mosul, for example, the Islamic State (ISIS) dispatched small and agile consumer drones armed with grenades to harry the Iraqi forces assembled to retake the city.These uses of social media, encryption, and drones illustrate a key pattern: As a consumer technology becomes widely available, terrorists will look for ways to adapt it. Artificial intelligence will almost certainly end up fitting into this pattern.Like drones, AI will likely become much more widely available in commercial markets at reduced costs, and individuals will be able to modify and repurpose it. AI already enjoys diverse applications, from products like Apple’s Siri, to voice-to-text, to Facebook’s counter-extremism detection systems.

So how might terrorists use AI?Perhaps they will start with social-network mapping. ISIS’s early battlefield victories were enabled, in part, by ex-Baathist intelligence operatives who mapped a city’s key players and power brokers, monitored their pattern of life—and then helped ISIS to arrest or kill them. Similarly, when North African ISIS operatives attacked the Tunisian town of Ben Gardane in March 2016, the available evidence—including the efficient way they assassinated key security officials—suggested that the militants had similarly worked to learn the human terrain in advance. Will social networks built using AI capabilities reduce the intelligence burden on militant groups and make it easier for them to conquer towns and cities?What of the next generation of terror drones? Will they use AI-enabled swarming to become  more powerful and deadlier? Or think bigger: will terrorists use self-driving vehicles for their next car bombs and ramming attacks? How about assassinations?Max Tegmark’s book Life 3.0 notes the concern of UC Berkeley computer scientist Stuart Russell, who worries that the biggest winners from an AI arms race would be “small rogue states and non-state actors such as terrorists” who can access these weapons through the black market. Tegmark writes that after they are “mass-produced, small AI-powered killer drones are likely to cost little more than a smartphone.” Would-be assassins could simply “upload their target’s photo and address into the killer drone: it can then fly to the destination, identify and eliminate the person, and self-destruct to ensure that nobody knows who was responsible.”Thinking beyond trigger-pulling, artificial intelligence could boost a wide range of violent non-state actors’ criminal activities, including extortion and kidnapping, through the automation of social engineering attacks. The militant recruiters of the near-future may boost their online radicalization efforts with chatbots, which played a “small but strategic role” in shaping the Brexit vote.The 9/11 Commission’s report famously devoted an entire section to discussing how the 9/11 attacks’ success in part represented a failure in imagination by authorities. In recent years, we have seen multiple failures in imagination as analysts tried to discern what terrorists will do with emerging technologies. A failure in imagination as artificial intelligence becomes cheaper and more widely available could be even costlier.

Many feel anxious about the impact of new technology on their jobs. This is not new. In fact, it dates back at least to the Luddites movement at the outset of the Industrial Revolution. And it resurfaced during the Great Depression and again in the 1960s, following a period of high productivity growth, and in the 1980s at the outset of the IT revolution.
How can governments help? By investing in peoples’ skills.
A dramatic shift
In the past, technological advances have helped raise incomes for most. But we should not forget that the transitions involved—for workers, firms, sectors, and whole economies—have been difficult for many.
Many observers think the latest wave of technological innovation will be more disruptive than the ones in the past, especially for labor. They point to the timid growth of real wages and the falling labor share in national income in recent decades. New technological advances—in artificial intelligence, automation and robotics—might be even more dramatic. This is because of the presumed ease with which some technologies can substitute for a broad range of human skills.

Better by design
To begin, we need to understand the most recent wave of technology and its potential impact. Not all labor is replaceable, and artificial intelligence might transform jobs more than it will make them obsolete. And technological advances boost productivity, which over time creates new jobs, allows incomes and living standards to rise. In fact, our research indicates that the current slow wage dynamics is related to low productivity growth. But countries need policies  to harness the benefits of technological change, and to address its less-welcome repercussions on wages and inequality.

So, what should countries do?
First, countries need policies to facilitate labor reallocation and shorten periods during which labor remains idle. For example, re-allocating labor could be easier with a stronger, while temporary, unemployment insurance. And social benefits may need to be more portable. Denmark has strong labor market institutions which combine flexible hiring and firing rules with extensive active labor market policies and relatively generous safety nets. The system is generally successful in matching labor supply and demand, and unemployment is low by international comparison.
But this, by itself, may not help those who are less prepared to benefit from change. People need policies that provide them with opportunities. Building human capital is key. This could mean more or more effective public spending on education, making it responsive to market demands and providing opportunities for life-long learning. For example, Singapore offers unconditional grants to all adults for training throughout their working lives.

Redistribution through the tax-benefit system could be another way to spread the gains from technological advances. Some economies have used available fiscal space for redistribution to spread the gains from technological change more equitably. For example, Canada cut the tax rate for middle income earners to strengthen the middle class, and more recently, made income tax benefits more generous, including by expanding eligibility. While redistribution is part of each countries’ social contract, IMF research indicates that addressing inequality may be beneficial for growth, and therefore important for a country’s economy.
Redistribution, however, comes at the cost of efficiency. That said, if governments design policies in the right way, all income groups can still gain.
So what is our bottom line? Technological advances present incredible economic and social opportunities. But they need to be supported by the right policies to ensure that they bring benefits to all.

Sign up.BEIJING — The most momentous challenge facing socio-economic systems today is the arrival of artificial intelligence. If AI remains under the control of market forces, it will inexorably result in a super-rich oligopoly of data billionaires who reap the wealth created by robots that displace human labor, leaving massive unemployment in their wake.But China’s socialist market economy could provide a solution to this. If AI rationally allocates resources through big data analysis, and if robust feedback loops can supplant the imperfections of “the invisible hand” while fairly sharing the vast wealth it creates, a planned economy that actually works could at last be achievable.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe more AI advances into a general-purpose technology that permeates every corner of life, the less sense it makes to allow it to remain in private hands that serve the interests of the few instead of the many. More than anything else, the inevitability of mass unemployment and the demand for universal welfare will drive the idea of socializing or nationalizing AI.GET CAUGHT UPStories to keep you informedPreviousNextDissenting Republican delegates sign protest of Trump platform At issue is the treatment of abortion in the new document.The “minority report” criticizes the 2024 platform’s lack of a “human life amendment.”

The billionaires of Google and Apple, who have been depositing company profits in offshore havens to avoid taxation, are hardly paragons of social responsibility. The ongoing scandal around Facebook’s business model, which puts profitability above responsible citizenship, is yet another example of how in digital capitalism, private companies only look after their own interests at the expense of the rest of society.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementOne can readily see where this is all headed once technological unemployment accelerates. “Our responsibility is to our shareholders,” the robot owners will say. “We are not an employment agency or a charity.”Share this articleShareThese companies have been able to get away with their social irresponsibility because the legal system and its loopholes in the West are geared to protect private property above all else. Of course, in China, we have big privately owned Internet companies like Alibaba and Tencent. But unlike in the West, they are monitored by the state and do not regard themselves as above or beyond social control.It is the very pervasiveness of AI that will spell the end of market dominance. The market may reasonably if unequally function if industry creates employment opportunities for most people. But when industry only produces joblessness, as robots take over more and more, there is no good alternative but for the state to step in. As AI invades economic and social life, all private law-related issues will soon become public ones. More and more, regulation of private companies will become a necessity to maintain some semblance of stability in societies roiled by constant innovation.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementI consider this historical process a step closer to a planned market economy. Laissez-faire capitalism as we have known it can lead nowhere but to a dictatorship of AI oligarchs who gather rents because the intellectual property they own rules over the means of production. On a global scale, it is easy to envision this unleashed digital capitalism leading to a battle between robots for market share that will surely end as disastrously as the imperialist wars did in an earlier era.For the sake of social well-being and security, individuals and private companies should not be allowed to possess any exclusive cutting-edge technology or core AI platforms. Like nuclear and biochemical weapons, as long as they exist, nothing other than a strong and stable state can ensure society’s safety. If we don’t nationalize AI, we could sink into a dystopia reminiscent of the early misery of industrialization, with its satanic mills and street urchins scrounging for a crust of bread.The dream of communism is the elimination of wage labor. If AI is bound to serve society instead of private capitalists, it promises to do so by freeing an overwhelming majority from such drudgery while creating wealth to sustain all.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIf the state controls the market, instead of digital capitalism controlling the state, true communist aspirations will be achievable. And because AI increasingly enables the management of complex systems by processing massive amounts of information through intensive feedback loops, it presents, for the first time, a real alternative to the market signals that have long justified laissez-faire ideology — and all the ills that go with it.Going forward, China’s socialist market economy, which aims to harness the fruits of production for the whole population and not just a sliver of elites operating in their own self-centered interests, can lead the way toward this new stage of human development.If properly regulated in this way, we should celebrate, not fear, the advent of AI. If it is brought under social control, it will finally free workers from peddling their time and sweat only to enrich those at the top.

GeekWire’s Health Tech Podcast goes in-depth with tech innovators bringing new ideas and ingenuity to health and wellness.

In December of 2012, Su-In Lee was working at the University of Washington in Seattle. One day, she got the kind of call everyone fears: Her father, Cheol Lee, was diagnosed with gallbladder cancer, a rare and aggressive form of the disease. By the time he was diagnosed, his cancer had already spread to other organs.
“It was a surprise to our family,” Lee said on the newest episode of GeekWire’s Health Tech Podcast. “The next day I just went back to Korea and met his doctor and then found that it’s incurable, especially in that stage.”
Not only was his cancer incurable, there actually isn’t a single drug designed to treat it. So Cheol’s doctors gave him a drug designed for pancreatic cancer, the organ next to the gallbladder. They hoped it would give him a few more weeks with his family.
“While I was taking care of my father, I kept thinking that it would be really great if we can find a drug that works for his cancer,” Lee said. “After three months, he passed away.”
Lee was changed by her father’s passing. She came back to Seattle with a new goal: Find a way to help cancer patients get the best treatment possible, even if that only means giving them a little bit more time with their family.
In the past five years, Lee — a professor of computer science and genome science at the UW — has grown that goal into a precision medicine program called MERGE. MERGE uses machine learning along with a patient’s DNA and other health data to predict which treatments will work best to help them fight the disease.
It’s just one of the growing number of precision medicine projects that are leveraging an expertise in artificial intelligence and a growing understanding of the human body to fight diseases of all shapes and sizes, from deadly cancer to the mysterious Alzheimer’s disease.
Hear Lee’s full story and learn more about precision medicine work in the most recent episode of GeekWire’s Health Tech Podcast. Listen in the player below or search for “Health Tech” to subscribe in your favorite podcast app.

Lee was singularly equipped to meet the challenge she set out for herself. She’s an expert in computational biology, using advanced computer science and biological data to understand the human body.
“So I kept thinking that if we understand the genetic and the molecular profile of my father’s individual cancer, we can potentially find the drug that’s going to work the best for him,” Lee said. “Even if it’s stage four. For patients in that stage, it’s really extending several months of the lifetime — it means a lot, to the patient and to the family.”
Heather Mefford, a pediatric neurologist and the deputy scientific director of Seattle’s Brotman Baty Institute for Precision Medicine, said that the approach isn’t just about finding the treatment that will extend the patient’s lifetime. There are many reasons precision medicine could be valuable to a patient.
“To decrease their risk for side effects, for example. To maximize the effect that the therapy that you give them is going to have at either treating or preventing a particular disease,” she said. It’s all about “making healthcare as efficient as possible for the individual.”
The approach is also helping scientists better understand the causes of some diseases, like Alzheimer’s.
 While I was taking care of my father, I kept thinking that it would be really great if we can find a drug that works for his cancer.
But Lee wanted to focus on cancer patients. She teamed up with two Seattle researchers and hematologists: Dr. Pamela Becker and Dr. Tony Blau, whose startup All4Cure was featured on a previous Health Tech episode.
Blau and Becker are hematologists, or blood cancer experts, so they focused on understanding acute myeloid leukemia, AML. It’s one of the most common kinds of leukemia.
To train the MERGE algorithm, Lee and her team extracted genetic profiles from 30 blood samples taken from Blau and Becker’s past patients. Thanks to new technology, we can create genetic profiles like this in just under a day.
But the amount of data it creates is immense. One person’s genetic profile can hold a terabyte of data. If you printed it into the average-sized paperback, that would be three million books, or about 20 percent of the Library of Congress.
That’s where machine learning comes in. Lee and her team used the genetic data from those patients — along with data on the drugs they took and how they responded — to train a machine learning algorithm. They also incorporated publicly available data on AML patients to expand the training set.
As it sorted through the data, the algorithm found patterns and started to make connections between certain genes and drugs. Interestingly enough, it made too many connections — Lee said teaching the algorithm how to tell the difference between important and unimportant connections was actually challenging.

“If this gene does something important in cancer, then that means that this association between that gene and in any drugs should be considered important,” Lee said. Genes that regulate tear ducts, for example, probably aren’t as important.
Today, MERGE is close to accurately predicting responses to some of the most common AML drugs. Lee and her team are continuing their work and even working on a more complex version of the system that can predict responses to multiple drugs at once.
Their work has been built on the data of real patients who were willing to share it anonymously in the name of science. Lee said her work, and the work of others, is dependent on the generosity of anonymous patients all over the world.
“I’ve been on both sides,” Lee said. “Patients really should consider giving their data. It’s like donating money — it can be better than that, actually. … I also got the data from my father’s sample. It wasn’t actually easy, you know — being a patient, I’m a little more emotional than being a scientist.”
She shared the data with the hospital where her father was treated. She wanted them to use it for research, in the hopes that one day it could lead to new treatments or cures for people like her father.
Editor’s note: Researcher Suman Jayadev‘s work is also included in this episode.

Those fundamental building blocks of civilization have led humans toward new kinds of innovation in the form of art, music, architecture and philosophy. These innovations have helped civilizations flourish and amplify human intelligence through various revolutions.
In the progress of human civilization, two major historical revolutions have been consequential: the Agricultural and the Industrial Revolution. The first one is the sole reason behind the creation of societies and the latter one helped enhance the overall productivity of society. But the Industrial Revolution has also changed the economy’s source of productivity from the farm to the factory.
The rise of a data-driven world
The 21st century has seen a new era of the rapid pace of technological changes. The information-technology revolution marked the shift from mechanical and analog electronic technology to digital electronics.
The massive increase in computational power and the rise of Internet-based services made the world more interconnected. It has affected the whole of our lives and almost every sector of modern human activity such as banking, trading, learning, teaching and management.
The Industrial Revolution increased man’s mechanical power, and information technology is extending man’s intellectual power through complex computing and technology. This thrust of intellectual power is leading humanity toward an intelligence explosion through artificial intelligence.
The start of a machine-based world order
“Artificial intelligence” used to refer to fascinating concepts of machines becoming intelligent enough to mimic the life of a human in regards to the decision-making process. But these days such machines have become a reality as well as an integral part of our lives and are actively becoming part of workplaces.

The best example is chatbots, which learn from our conversations and handle any complicated queries. This type of deep learning, which allows a machine to process information and reach a particular meaning without relying on predefined behavioral algorithms, is highly sophisticated.
These prototypes are considered non-sentient artificial intelligence, which performs only one function or task. But recent advances in this field through various technological innovations has proved that AI can perform complex multiple operations in fractions of a second. Recently, Google AlphaGo made history by beating a human opponent and winning a 2,000-year-old board game that is an order of magnitude more complex than chess and cannot be mastered through brute-force tactics.
Although the full potential of AI has not been reached yet, corporations and heavy industries have started incorporating some artificial intelligence in their day-to-day business operations to achieve efficiency gains.
As artificial intelligence goes mainstream, it is becoming part of our day-to-day personal lives through such products as Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and the Apple HomePod. This has been seen as a Fourth Industrial Revolution that is reaching into our homes.
But the real question that must bother to humanity is whether this AI-led Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) will help solve the world’s most complex problems and what impacts it can bring to humanity in the near future.
We are already seeing the impacts of 4IR in the form of AI in health care, security and education, which mainly rely on data. Although the human brain is capable of comprehending the most complex data, it has a limitation, that is, the speed with which it processes data. This boundary of the human brain can be overcome by artificial intelligence.
AI can look directly into account variability in genes, environments, and lifestyles before the treatment of a disease. This will allow doctors to have more accurate data that will improve the precision of medical treatment, leading to the patient’s quick recovery.
AI will significantly help increase farm productivity by reducing wastage and implementing new techniques with far more precise agricultural processes.
The biggest potential impact of AI will be on the world of work and the job market. A recent report released by McKinsey & Company indicated that by 2030, more than 800 million workers worldwide would be replaced by AI and robots. The greatest job displacement is expected in the areas of transportation, storage, manufacturing and retail.
Soon, the challenge facing humanity will be regarded as man versus machine in terms of productivity and efficiency
Soon AI will take away the most repetitive and boring work, which will enable individuals to spend some quality time on a creative problem-solving, which will able to boost productivity.

The exponential rise of AI in society will have a massive impact on our lifestyles. There will be automated vehicles, and intelligent robots doing ordinary day-to-day work like answering e-mails and handling data-entry operations. But such a massive level of involvement of automated machines will help increase social unrest as it completely changes the nature of work.
The real danger to humanity is posed by sentient artificial intelligence. “Sentient AI” refers to a machine that is quite aware of itself and its close environment as well as having the ability to process massive amounts of data in real time. These conscious machines will be capable of raising the most basic questions about the legal and ethical problems regarding their own existence as slaves of humans rather than as their partners or even their masters.
What will be the future of humanity as it faces such intelligent machines that have more information, a far more complex structure and diverse laws based on codes? A society that develops around such smart machines will need to go through serious introspection to avoid the risk of becoming irrelevant.
The idea of Homo machinus is likely to be the only option for humanity, where human minds will have a closer merger with artificial intelligence before the advent of singularity. This race will be a product of a combination of biological intelligence with digital intelligence to help them compete with machines. This partnership of humans and machines will bring in a new civilization whose ethics and future cannot be comprehended at this moment.

Now, AI has come full circle and is helping neuroscientists better understand how our own brains work.",N/A,,,,,,,,,,,N/A,N/A,"



For years, the people developing artificial intelligence drew inspiration from what was known about the human brain, and it has enjoyed a lot of success as a result. Now, AI is starting to return the favor.Although not explicitly designed to do so, certain artificial intelligence systems seem to mimic our brains’ inner workings more closely than previously thought, suggesting that both AI and our minds have converged on the same approach to solving problems. If so, simply watching AI at work could help researchers unlock some of the deepest mysteries of the brain.“There’s a real connection there,” said Daniel Yamins, assistant professor of psychology. Now, Yamins, who is also a faculty scholar of the Stanford Neurosciences Institute and a member of Stanford Bio-X, and his lab are building on that connection to produce better theories of the brain – how it perceives the world, how it shifts efficiently from one task to the next and perhaps, one day, how it thinks.A vision problem for AIArtificial intelligence has been borrowing from the brain since its early days, when computer scientists and psychologists developed algorithms called neural networks that loosely mimicked the brain. Those algorithms were frequently criticized for being biologically implausible – the “neurons” in neural networks were, after all, gross simplifications of the real neurons that make up the brain. But computer scientists didn’t care about biological plausibility. They just wanted systems that worked, so they extended neural network models in whatever way made the algorithm best able to carry out certain tasks, culminating in what is now called deep learning.Then came a surprise. In 2012, AI researchers showed that a deep learning neural network could learn to identify objects in pictures as well as a human being, which got neuroscientists wondering: How did deep learning do it?The same way the brain does, as it turns out. In 2014, Yamins and colleagues showed that a deep learning system that had learned to identify objects in pictures – nearly as well as humans could – did so in a way that closely mimicked the way the brain processes vision. In fact, the computations the deep learning system performed matched activity in the brain’s vision-processing circuits substantially better than any other model of those circuits.Around the same time, other teams made similar observations about parts of the brain’s vision– and movement-processing circuits, suggesting that given the same kind of problem, deep learning and the brain had evolved similar ways of coming up with a solution. More recently, Yamins and colleagues have demonstrated similar observations in the brain’s auditory system.On one hand, that’s not a big surprise. Although the technical details differ, deep learning’s conceptual organization is borrowed directly from what neuroscientists already knew about the organization of neurons in the brain.But the success of Yamins and colleagues’ approach and others like it depends equally as much on another, more subtle choice. Rather than try to get the deep learning system to directly match what the brain does at the level of individual neurons, as many researchers had done, Yamins and colleagues simply gave their deep learning system the same problem: Identify objects in pictures. Only after it had solved that problem did the researchers compare how deep learning and the brain arrived at their solutions – and only then did it become clear that their methods were essentially the same.“The correspondence between the models and the visual system is not entirely a coincidence, because one directly inspired the other,” said Daniel Bear, a postdoctoral researcher in Yamins’ group, “but it’s still remarkable that it’s as good a correspondence as it is.”One likely reason for that, Bear said, is natural selection and evolution. “Basically, object recognition was a very evolutionarily important task” for animals to solve – and solve well, if they wanted to tell the difference between something they could eat and something that could eat them. Perhaps trying to do that as well as humans and other animals do – except with a computer – led researchers to find essentially the same solution.Seek what the brain seeksWhatever the underlying reason, insights gleaned from the 2014 study led to what Yamins calls goal-directed models of the brain: Rather than try to model neural activity in the brain directly, instead train artificial intelligence to solve problems the brain needs to solve, then use the resulting AI system as a model of the brain. Since 2014, Yamins and collaborators have been refining the original goal-directed model of the brain’s vision circuits and extending the work in new directions, including understanding the neural circuits that process inputs from rodents’ whiskers.In perhaps the most ambitious project, Yamins and postdoctoral fellow Nick Haber are investigating how infants learn about the world around them through play. Their infants – actually relatively simple computer simulations – are motivated only by curiosity. They explore their worlds by moving around and interacting with objects, learning as they go to predict what happens when they hit balls or simply turn their heads. At the same time, the model learns to predict what parts of the world it doesn’t understand, then tries to figure those out.While the computer simulation begins life – so to speak – knowing essentially nothing about the world, it eventually figures out how to categorize different objects and even how to smash two or three of them together. Although direct comparisons with babies’ neural activity might be premature, the model could help researchers better understand how infants use play to learn about their environments, Haber said.On the other end of the spectrum, models inspired by artificial intelligence could help solve a puzzle about the physical layout of the brain, said Eshed Margalit, a graduate student in neurosciences. As the vision circuits in infants’ brains develop, they form specific patches – physical clusters of neurons – that respond to different kinds of objects. For example, humans and other primates all form a face patch that is active almost exclusively when they look at faces.Exactly why the brain forms those patches, Margalit said, isn’t clear. The brain doesn’t need a face patch to recognize faces, for example. But by building on AI models like Yamins’ that already solve object recognition tasks, “we can now try to model that spatial structure and ask questions about why the brain is laid out this way and what advantages it might give an organism,” Margalit said.Closing the loopThere are other issues to tackle as well, notably how artificial intelligence systems learn. Right now, AI needs much more training – and much more explicit training – than humans do in order to perform as well on tasks like object recognition, although how humans succeed with so little data remains unclear.A second issue is how to go beyond models of vision and other sensory systems. “Once you have a sensory impression of the world, you want to make decisions based on it,” Yamins said. “We’re trying to make models of decision making, learning to make decisions and how you interface between sensory systems, decision making and memory.” Yamins is starting to address those ideas with Kevin Feigelis, a graduate student in physics, who is building AI models that can learn to solve many different kinds of problems and switch between tasks as needed, something very few AI systems are able to do.In the long run, Yamins and the other members of his group said all of those advances could feed into more capable artificial intelligence systems, just as earlier neuroscience research helped foster the development of deep learning. “I think people in artificial intelligence are realizing there are certain very good next goals for cognitively inspired artificial intelligence,” Haber said, including systems like his that learn by actively exploring their worlds. “People are playing with these ideas.”

                ","For policymakers anywhere, the best way to make decisions is to base them on evidence, however imperfect the available data may be. But what should leaders do when facts are scarce or non-existent? That is the quandary facing those who must grapple with the fallout of &ldquo;advanced predictive algorithms&rdquo; &ndash; the binary building blocks of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). In academic circles, AI-minded scholars are either &ldquo;singularitarians&rdquo; or &ldquo;presentists.&rdquo; Singularitarians generally argue that while AI technologies pose an existential threat to humanity, the benefits outweigh the costs. But although this group includes many tech luminaries and attracts significant funding, its academic output has so far failed to prove their calculus convincingly. On the other side, presentists tend to focus on the fairness, accountability, and transparency of new technologies. They are concerned, for example, with how automation will affect the labour market. But here, too, the research has been unpersuasive. For example, MIT Technology Review recently compared the findings of 19 major studies examining predicted job losses, and found that forecasts for the number of globally &ldquo;destroyed&rdquo; jobs vary from 1.8mn to 2bn. Simply put, there is no &ldquo;serviceable truth&rdquo; to either side of this debate. When predictions of AI&rsquo;s impact range from minor job-market disruptions to human extinction, clearly the world needs a new framework to analyse and manage the coming technological disruption. To be sure, incomplete data are a common problem for technology researchers. Even under &ldquo;normal&rdquo; conditions, the study of emerging technologies is like solving a puzzle in the dark with a dim flashlight. The assumptions of established theories are not questioned, and securing beneficial outcomes is a matter of quantifying probabilities of adverse events and consequently managing the associated risks. But every so often, a &ldquo;post-normal&rdquo; scientific puzzle emerges, something philosophers Silvio Funtowicz and Jerome Ravetz first defined in 1993 as a problem &ldquo;where facts are uncertain, values in dispute, stakes high, and decisions urgent.&rdquo; For these challenges &ndash; of which AI is one &ndash; policy cannot afford to wait for science to catch up. At the moment, most AI policymaking occurs in the Global North, which deemphasises the concerns of less developed countries and makes it harder to govern dual-use technologies. Worse, policymakers often fail adequately to consider the potential environmental impact, and focus almost exclusively on the anthropogenic effects of automation, robotics, and machines. Even without reliable data, decision-makers must move forward with AI governance. And, as the world waits for scientific certainty (which may never arrive), there is an existing solution that can guide us into the unknown: the &ldquo;precautionary principle.&rdquo; Adopted globally in 1992 as part of the United Nations Rio Convention on sustainable development, and later incorporated into one of the European Union&rsquo;s founding treaties, the precautionary principle states that a lack of certainty cannot be a basis for failing to protect human health or the environment. That seems like a suitable way to address the uncertainty of a tech-driven future. The precautionary principle is not without its detractors. But while its merits have been debated for years, we need to accept that the lack of evidence of harm is not the same thing as evidence of lack of harm. This simple idea has been applied to myriad human development issues &ndash; from public health to infant mortality. There are three good reasons why AI should be next. For starters, applying the precautionary principle to the context of AI would help rebalance the global policy discussion, giving weaker voices more influence in debates that are currently monopolised by corporate interests. Decision-making would also be more inclusive and deliberative, and produce solutions that more closely reflected societal needs. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and The Future Society at Harvard&rsquo;s Kennedy School of Government are already spearheading work in this participatory spirit. Additional professional organisations and research centres should follow suit. Moreover, by applying the precautionary principle, governance bodies could shift the burden of responsibility to the creators of algorithms. A requirement of explainability of algorithmic decision-making can change incentives, prevent blackboxing, help make business decisions more transparent, and allow the public sector to catch up with the private sector in technology development. And, by forcing tech companies and governments to identify and consider multiple options, the precautionary principle would bring to the fore neglected issues, like environmental impact. Rarely is science in a position to help manage an innovation long before the consequences of that innovation are available for study. But, in the context of algorithms, machine learning, and AI, humanity cannot afford to wait. The beauty of the precautionary principle lies not only in its grounding in international public law, but also in its track record as a framework for managing innovation in myriad scientific contexts.

Silicon Valley might not like the idea of war, Lt. Col. Garry Floyd said Tuesday, but it happens. And when it does, the military wants to be sure that America’s forces have the best technology possible — not only to win the fight but also to minimize its footprint.
In delicately delivered comments at this week’s Modular Open Systems Summit, Floyd, who serves as deputy chief of the Algorithmic Warfare Cross Functional Team (also known as Project Maven), spoke about the status of his work, identified key lessons learned and responded to recent criticism from the West Coast.
Project Maven, which is led by Air Force Lt. Gen. John “Jack” Shanahan, is an artificial intelligence and machine learning project that aims to help Air Force analysts make better use of full-motion video surveillance. Instead of having human operators sift through hours and hours of surveillance video, Project Maven deploys an AI algorithm that can aid with some of this grunt work.
The Project Maven team is small, but it has some assistance from industry leaders, including Google. However, not everyone at Google in on board with the idea.

In April, the New York Times reported that “thousands” of Google employees had signed a letter urging the company to cease involvement with Project Maven. “We believe that Google should not be in the business of war,” the letter reads. The individuals who signed the letter are concerned about an increase in drone strikes. Google, meanwhile, has described its involvement as “non-offensive.”
Floyd sees the situation a little differently. In his eyes, the “business of war” is unavoidable. What’s negotiable is the tools one has available while on the battlefield.
“Those of us who are in uniform — we know that the call will come and that we will go down range and we’ll answer the call,” Floyd said. “That will happen. It will happen more often then we want it to happen, but we know it will happen… so we hope that we’ll have the best tools we can possibly have to help us do our jobs.”
“A good decision means you accomplish your mission quicker,” he continued. “A good decision means you minimize things like collateral damage, unintended casualties and all those other things.”
And AI systems like Project Maven, Floyd said, show promise in helping warfighters make good decisions more often.

“I think what you’ll see is there will be those who will partner with us and will help us do the things that we need to do to be successful,” Floyd said. “Because success revolves around accomplishing the mission rapidly so we can all come home safe and so that we keep collateral damage to a minimum.”
While Project Maven is still in “very very early” stages, Floyd said, it has already been deployed to five or six combat locations including the United States Africa Command. There, the team is testing its “prototype warfare” strategy — deploying a capacity that is around “80 percent” there and getting comfortable with the idea of making improvements “on the fly.”
There’s a button right in the Project Maven user interface, Floyd said, that says “train AI.” This allows for the retraining and improvement of the algorithm based on new data, and it’s a key capacity. After deploying Project Maven to AFRICOM in December, Floyd told the crowd, the team updated the algorithm about six times in five days.
“It’s not all that different, if you think about it, than a young airman,” Floyd said. “On their first day of work its going to take them a little while to understand what’s going on, to understand the mission … you see a similar version of that with the AI.”

KEY TAKEAWAYS
As computing power has increased, programming languages have evolved to take advantage of enhanced computing resources.




Programming languages were used even before computers were invented. For example, a player piano scroll, that long roll of encoded paper tape, is considered an early form of programming because it contained the instructions needed to make a piano play a tune.
The first computers were programmed by flipping switches and changing the configuration of the hardware. As a result, early programmers had to be intimately familiar with computer hardware. But we’ve come a long way, and high-level programming languages require little or no knowledge of the underlying hardware.
Let's take a look at how we got this far by covering the five generations of computer programming languages. (Get some background on some of the key figures in the field in The Pioneers of Computer Programming.)
The First Generation – Programming at the Machine Level
First-generation programming languages (1GL) are often known as machine languages or machine code. They operate at the lowest level of abstraction (closest to the hardware) of all languages. First-generation languages deal directly with the binary zeros and ones that are used to store and process information in a computer. Programs in higher-level languages must be compiled or assembled into machine code in order to run.
First-generation languages were used to program first-generation computers such as UNIVAC I and the IBM 701. (To learn more about early programming, see The Women of ENIAC: Programming Pioneers.)
The Second Generation – Some Assembly Required
Second-generation languages (2GL), often known as assembly languages, were developed largely because of the difficulty in programming with first-generation languages. Although still low-level languages, assembly languages introduced the use of symbolic codes (called mnemonics) to represent instructions to the computer. A program in assembly language is translated into machine code by means of a utility known as an assembler.Advertisements




Since they operate at the lowest level of abstraction, second-generation languages offer the benefits of speed and minimum code size. They also enable a programmer to directly manipulate hardware components such as memory locations and registers. At one time, assembly languages were used to program operating systems and applications that required smaller, faster-running code, such as video games. Examples of games written in assembly language include console games for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis platform and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System platform.
Although largely supplanted by higher-level languages, assembly languages are still used in situations where hardware interaction is required or performance must be optimized. Some compilers for higher-level languages compile source code to an assembly language before invoking an assembler to compile to machine code.
The Third Generation – Gentleman’s C and Others
The third generation of programming languages (3GL) includes high-level languages such as C, C++, Fortran, COBOL, BASIC, C# and Java. Third-generation programming languages represent a major improvement in usability over assembly languages.
Unlike assembly languages, third-generation languages are not machine-specific. When programming with a third-generation language, a programmer writes the source code for the program and then uses a compiler to translate it into object code (or machine code), which can be understood by the targeted computer.
The development of programming paradigms such as structured programming and object-oriented programming (OOP) coincided with the development of third-generation languages.
The Fourth Generation – Programmer Enhancement
Fourth-generation programming languages (4GL) were created to enhance programmer productivity in specific domains such as database querying and report generation.
The syntax of a fourth-generation language is generally closer to human language than the syntax from previous generations of programming languages. A single statement in a fourth-generation language can automatically generate the equivalent of a series of instructions in a third-generation language, reducing the time it takes to develop an application.
Examples of fourth-generation languages include Structured Query Language (SQL), Informix-4GL and ColdFusion.
The Fifth Generation – Watson, I Presume
Fifth-generation languages (5GL) are often used in the realm of artificial intelligence.
The traditional unit of computation is the algorithm, which is basically a step-by-step procedure for calculating a solution. Fifth-generation languages attempt to go beyond the algorithm by defining the conditions (or properties) for a solution and allowing the computer to determine the possible solutions that meet the specified conditions.
An example of a fifth-generation language is Prolog, which was one of the languages used to program IBM’s Watson in preparation for its participation on the television quiz show ""Jeopardy!""
Why Should I Care?
There you have it, the generations of programming languages really aren't that hard to understand. A good mental model is the higher up you get, the further abstracted you are from the hardware. This means less control, but also less work to accomplish something through programming.
Why does this matter? While theoretical, it's key to understand where your development fits in. Many developers spend the majority of their day in an integrated development environment for a 3GL language, so understanding that a language is 2GL or 4GL gives you some perspective as to the level of detail required to produce usable code. In general, working with a 2GL language is going to be more complex than a 3GL language. On the other hand, you can accomplish much less with a 4GL language like SQL than with a 3GL like C.
Where to From Here?
Will there be additional generations of programming languages? Some computer professionals consider graphical development environments to be a separate programming language generation. With the advent of apps, it's easier and easier to develop new software. Some people also point to concepts like ""build your own app"" as evidence that even regular users will be developers in certain areas. In any event, it’s likely that future generations of programmers will have new generations of programming languages to assist them.

The winners of California State University, Northridge’s first-ever artificial intelligence (AI) student venture competition — dubbed AI-Jam — were chosen in April at an event that took place at CSUN’s Jack and Florence Ferman Presentation Room in the Delmar T. Oviatt Library.
Each team participated in a showcase and were scored on their project’s use of artificial intelligence, or “AI-ness,” feasibility and quality.
The AI-Jam competition, created by CSUN’s Department of Information Technology, included two tracks: research and innovation.
KLab’s Butterflies, an artificial intelligence project that uses a robot to mimic a child with a behavioral or learning challenge, was awarded first place in the research track. The goal of KLab’s Butterflies is to more effectively train students on how to work with children who express similar reactions as the robot.
The KLab’s Butterflies team is made up of CSUN students Vahe Esmaeili, Ryan Moradpour, Victory Ramirez and Christina Saez. After winning AI-Jam, Saez said that the group plans “on utilizing artificial intelligence to create realistic simulations for practical, individualized training.”
Anyone interested in joining or collaborating with KLab’s Butterflies can visit their website, https://klab-csun.weebly.com.
AI-Adventurers won second place in research at the inaugural AI-Jam competition. The team’s project takes an approach to healthy eating using AI and image recognition to aid in portion control.
Third place in the research track went to Helia Nutrition and Health. The project aims to increase the accuracy of individual food logs by using AI and image recognition to track an individual’s daily food intake.
The innovation track had nine participating teams, including Agora, Fetch Bot, AI-Amigos, Deaf Connect and AI-Caramba.
The first-place winners in the innovation track were AI-Amigos, whose project goal was to help students excel in their careers by using a chatbot on Facebook to ask the CSUN Career Center questions that students have about the center’s services.
CSUN students and Career Center student assistants Diego Cobian, Marilyn Hightower, Natalia Moscoso, Lorena Roque and Jemma Tiongson joined forces to make up AI-Amigos. They said that winning first place was a surprise and an honor.

“We were super excited and happy, of course!” Tiongson said. “We’re glad we all work at a place like the Career Center, where we are supervised by Ana Penaranda. She really pushes us to achieve new personal heights in technology.”

Second and third place in innovation went to Deaf Connect and AI-Caramba, respectively. Deaf Connect is a project that uses machine learning, natural language processing and artificial intelligence to help the Deaf community access more resources, such as speech-to-text translation.
AI-Caramba uses natural language processing to recognize voice commands through Alexa by Amazon, to help students find information about the Career Center in a more intuitive and friendly manner.

His first foray into this medium, called Emissaries, is currently on show at London’s Serpentine Gallery. Cheng describes the works as “computer games that play themselves.”The three worlds/games – The Squat of Gods, Forks at Perfection and Sunsets the Self, in chronological order – flicker through improvised narrative loops on giant screens in three separate rooms at the gallery. In the first, loosely rendered figures wander from task to place to interaction, like a Sims game left unattended. In the second, clearly defined dogs gambol amongst fast-moving clumps of animated grass. In the final room, the action takes place on a blasted heath with curious expanding lakes of yellow goo breaking into smaller pieces, pursued by shambling creatures that try to burn them or tear them apart.Trending NowMachine Learning: Living in the Age of AIThe stories are set millennia apart in the same place, a landscape that evolves from volcano to lake to atoll. Each world is peopled by sentient AI agents. Using skills gained studying cognitive science at Berkeley and working at visual-effects company Industrial Light & Magic as well as a team of coders, Cheng has bestowed each agent three “mini brains”.“There’s the ‘threat brain’, fight or flight, then there’s the ‘limbic brain’ for desires and meanings – both influenced by the Sims AI where each Sim tried to meet its needs,” Cheng explains. “If these slow burning needs aren’t met, the agents become hungry and angry. When they are all satisfied, the ‘narrative brain’ cuts in and they start on their way to achieving goals.”In each game, one agent – the Emissary – has a more sophisticated purpose. In The Squat of Gods, this is a small girl who knows the volcano her tribe are living on is set to blow and tries to get everyone to leave. In Forks at Perfection, the AI is a curious combination of a dog and a long, thin, golden collar-and-lead called Sheba. The lead is the driving agent - the dog just a vehicle, abandoned by the lead when its usefulness expires. Together they’re searching for a perfect version of life and a way to understand humanity in a world of intelligent plants and the reanimated corpse of a 21st century celebrity. Finally, in Sunsets the Self, the Emissary is a sentient yellow puddle trying to achieve life by animating a Wormleaf anemone – racing against the semi-human Oomen, who want to burn each Wormleaf as it rises.

It’s hard not to impose your own storylines on the figures as they wander from task to task and interaction to interaction with unfathomable purpose. Cheng’s AIs have been coded with basic goals and try to achieve them. The methods they use are up to them. Once started, they follow their own paths, in ways the artist hadn’t imagined.Advertisement“It was hard to do at first,” Cheng explains. “All the artists I know are hyper control freaks creating art that’s perfected and left in a gallery. That feels like the evidence of energy expended – the debris left over from the act of creation. But in a world where everything is changing, our culture should reflect work that’s changing so I wanted to create something that feels alive, and would… misbehave…”Cheng’s lessons from Emissaries lead to BOB, his most audacious wrestling of an AI consciousness into an interactive art work. Created for the Serpentine Gallery, where it played in April, BOB is an animated body based on slime mould with an AI mind that grows, moves, reacts, plays and explores in a persistent, irreversible, ageing life.“Every 10-15 seconds BOB is sampling its environment and storing 25 different parameters, from its metabolism to how many heads it currently has, which it snapshots and stores - creating what I call a memory,” says Cheng. “Later, when it searches in its memory, it compares previous moments and measures if things are better or worse, happier or sadder, hungry or upset by food…”There are six separate BOBs – short for “Bag Of Beliefs”. When spawned, they resemble stripped red tadpoles with a cluster of eyes on their head. As they grow, new bodies branch off and new mini heads – Cheng calls them babyheads – sprout. Sometimes they work together. Sometimes they literally tear themselves apart, leaving decaying green corpse fragments dotted across the screen.During BOB’s stay at the Serpentine, visitors could interact with them by effectively Skyping in to one of the babyheads. “They’d normally try to take control of BOB and move towards an arch at the back of the screen,” explains Kay Watson, the gallery’s digital curator. “Sometimes BOB would get fed up and kick people out, which upset a surprising number of visitors - we’re not used to art that rejects us. One BOB simply refused to interact or grow and just sits in the middle of screen. We can’t work out if it’s desperately unhappy or supremely content.”She takes Wired into the control room at the heart of the gallery, built in the most impressive room usually reserved for spectacular works. For Cheng’s stay, it’s a hidden media lab controlling the Emissaries and still hosting the BOBs, which writhe and wriggle at varying speeds with what appears to be urgent purpose.“With BOB I’m trying to integrate different models of AI,” explains Cheng. “I wanted to create an interface to discuss how we think and talk about AI whilst forgetting the actual AI is there. I’d like us to see them as artificial lifeforms rather than spend so much time talking and arguing about the tech. The least interesting thing about Shakespeare is the guys who created papyrus in ancient Egypt. It’s the difference between creating paper and using paper to explore what it is to be human.”What has all this taught Cheng about being human? He pauses, then offers a practical rather than philosophical response. “I learned that the body matters,” he explains. “The body the AI is stuck in determines how it evolves and how it feels. It made me appreciate that the state of my body completely affects my brain – so I’m going to the gym a whole lot more these days.”Ian Cheng's Emissaries is on show at the Serpentine Galleries until May 28.This article was originally published by WIRED UKEnter your email to get the Wired newsletterclose dialogRecommended NewsletterFast ForwardA weekly dispatch from the future by Will Knight, exploring advances in AI and other technologies set to change our lives.

Created for the Serpentine Gallery, where it played in April, BOB is an animated body based on slime mould with an AI mind that grows, moves, reacts, plays and explores in a persistent, irreversible, ageing life.
“Every 10-15 seconds BOB is sampling its environment and storing 25 different parameters, from its metabolism to how many heads it currently has, which it snapshots and stores - creating what I call a memory,” says Cheng. “Later, when it searches in its memory, it compares previous moments and measures if things are better or worse, happier or sadder, hungry or upset by food…”
There are six separate BOBs – short for “Bag Of Beliefs”. When spawned, they resemble stripped red tadpoles with a cluster of eyes on their head. As they grow, new bodies branch off and new mini heads – Cheng calls them babyheads – sprout. Sometimes they work together. Sometimes they literally tear themselves apart, leaving decaying green corpse fragments dotted across the screen.
During BOB’s stay at the Serpentine, visitors could interact with them by effectively Skyping in to one of the babyheads. “They’d normally try to take control of BOB and move towards an arch at the back of the screen,” explains Kay Watson, the gallery’s digital curator. “Sometimes BOB would get fed up and kick people out, which upset a surprising number of visitors - we’re not used to art that rejects us. One BOB simply refused to interact or grow and just sits in the middle of screen. We can’t work out if it’s desperately unhappy or supremely content.”
She takes Wired into the control room at the heart of the gallery, built in the most impressive room usually reserved for spectacular works. For Cheng’s stay, it’s a hidden media lab controlling the Emissaries and still hosting the BOBs, which writhe and wriggle at varying speeds with what appears to be urgent purpose.
“With BOB I’m trying to integrate different models of AI,” explains Cheng. “I wanted to create an interface to discuss how we think and talk about AI whilst forgetting the actual AI is there. I’d like us to see them as artificial lifeforms rather than spend so much time talking and arguing about the tech. The least interesting thing about Shakespeare is the guys who created papyrus in ancient Egypt. It’s the difference between creating paper and using paper to explore what it is to be human.”
What has all this taught Cheng about being human? He pauses, then offers a practical rather than philosophical response. “I learned that the body matters,” he explains. “The body the AI is stuck in determines how it evolves and how it feels. It made me appreciate that the state of my body completely affects my brain – so I’m going to the gym a whole lot more these days.”
Ian Cheng's Emissaries is on show at the Serpentine Galleries until May 28.

For Michael Schmitz, working at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2) is arguably the best of all worlds.
Schmitz, who is a director of engineering at the Seattle-based organization, loves being able to marshal teams of engineers to tackle a problem, compared to the more limited resources and individual projects common in academic research. He gets to work on multiple projects at once. AI2’s goal is to make a positive difference in the world by creating tools for AI researchers, a mission that resonates with Schmitz. And it all takes place in the mossy Northwest, not far from family and his hometown of Everett.
“We’re an organization funded by (Microsoft co-founder) Paul Allen, who is an engineer at heart, and he was open to a company that had a strong financial investment and a good balance between researchers and engineers,” Schmitz said.
Schmitz joined AI2 soon after it launched in 2013. As a computer science undergraduate at the University of Washington, Schmitz had worked as a research programmer for Oren Etzioni, AI2’s CEO.
“As an early employee at the company, I’ve worn many hats,” Schmitz said. “I bootstrapped the engineering team when our company started, designed the early architecture of project Aristo, and led the engineering team on Semantic Scholar.”
Aristo is an AI system that can read, learn and ultimately reason about scientific information. Semantic Scholar — which earlier this week hired former Amazon Alexa engineer Doug Raymond — is a tool for academic literature research.
Schmitz’s current projects include managing AI2’s infrastructure team, which is focused on strategic investments, and the Beaker team, which is building a product for researchers to run and organize experiments in the cloud. Most of his time is spent on AllenNLP, an open-source research library that will allow academics and others in deep learning to more easily share their work.
“What I think is really motivating about working for the company is we’re very collaborative. We’re not competing with people internally, or even really with people externally,” Schmitz said. “People are passionate and that is contagious and makes it a great place to work.”
 People are passionate and that is contagious and makes it a great place to work.
Keep reading for more from our latest Working Geek: Michael Schmitz.
Current location: “My office is in Seattle near Gasworks Park on Lake Union”
Computer types: “A MacBook Air because I walk with my laptop a lot”
Mobile devices: “Google Pixel”
Favorite apps, cloud services and software tools: “GitHub. We started using it five years ago when the company began, and nobody has ever considered changing. We have pretty divergent technology stacks on different projects at AI2, but everyone uses GitHub. It has completely transformed how software engineers collaborate in the industry.”

Describe your workspace. Why does it work for you? “I have a desk that’s right on Lake Union so it gets plenty of natural light, which keeps me energized throughout the day. Beyond that, my workplace is just a mess of paper that is periodically recycled in batch and I have a laptop, monitor, phone charger, headphones, wooden bowl and spoon, and a ceramic mug.”
Your best advice for managing everyday work and life? “Keep a list of what you need to get done each day, stick with a task until you’re blocked or it’s done, and don’t push off to tomorrow what you can get done today.”
Your preferred social network? How do you use it for business/work? “I use Instagram a bit, but not for work. We use Twitter for company and project announcements, such as publications that win awards or new releases of our open-source software.”

Current number of unanswered emails in your inbox? “I currently have 1,363 unread emails, although that’s more because I have an unorthodox (bad) organization strategy for emails, not because I don’t read them. I have around 10 or so emails presently that I need to respond to.”
Number of appointments/meetings on your calendar this week? “16 so far.”
How do you run meetings? “I send out an email laying out the motivation for the meeting and the agenda, as well as clearly communicating the action items at the end.”
Everyday work uniform? “If it’s cold out, a plaid shirt and jeans. If it’s hot, maybe a short-sleeve button down and casual slacks.”
How do you make time for family? “I just do it.”
Best stress reliever? How do you unplug? “Turning wooden bowls on a reciprocating foot-powered lathe.”
 I develop most of my ideas slowly. I start by discussing problems with a diverse set of colleagues and then mulling over them in the back of my mind. Then, if I’m lucky, I get a great idea the first thing in the morning after waking up.
What are you listening to? “CBC Music radio (Rich Terfry), funk on 90.7 FM KSER (Saturday), and the roadhouse on 90.3 FM KEXP (Wednesday).”
Daily reads? Favorite sites and newsletters? “Y Combinator”
Book on your nightstand (or e-reader)? “I’m reading ‘The Collector,’ a biography of the Northwest botanist David Douglas, for whom the region’s Douglas fir is named.”
Night owl or early riser? “Early to bed, early to rise. I feel great in the morning, especially after a cup of tea. It’s not unusual for me to wake up and tell my wife ‘it’s a brand new day!’ She likes to sleep in.”
Where do you get your best ideas? “I develop most of my ideas slowly. I start by discussing problems with a diverse set of colleagues and then mulling over them in the back of my mind. Then, if I’m lucky, I get a great idea the first thing in the morning after waking up.”

10 Jobs most likely to be replaced by Artificial intelligence (AI) technology 
May 1, 2018 by Darshim Saxena 





Robots equipped with artificial intelligence are taking on the world. They are more popular than ever before. The functions that are performed by robots these days were hard to imagine 20 years back. Structural unemployment is prevalent in any growing economy. Thus, many of us are going to lose jobs to robots. Robots are much better than humans in specific areas and are said to boost sales.
A landmark study in 2013 classified the jobs that humans will soon lose to AI by 2024. The list, derived from the level of routine a position has, and the specialized training and social intelligence needed to do justice to it. Is indeed credible as it also inspired  “Will Robots Take My Job?”.

Jobs those likely to be replaced by robots artificial Intelligence
Image Source: kachwanya.com
 













 Telemarketers
The people employed in this sector have the highest likelihood of losing their job to AI, the likelihood being 99%. You already receive calls throughout the day from various companies and organizations and half of them are indeed robot-calls. Think about it, what is the level of social or emotional intelligence required to be successful as a telemarketer? Even when we think about their profit for companies, the conversion rates for direct phone calls are even less than 10%. This job offers ripe opportunities for AI and the career growth in this sector is prospected to decline by 3% by 2024.
 
 Bookkeeping
Cheap alternatives as compared to a person’s salary are already available. QuickBooks, FreshBooks and Microsoft Office have already taken a toll on the employment in this sector. There is 98% likelihood that the career growth it offers will decline further. It might drop by up to 8% by 2024.
 
 Compensation and Benefits Managers
Ironically, this sector is expected to grow by 7% by 2024. However, this doesn’t necessarily mean that the humans employed here have managed to shield their livelihood from AI. In future, multinational companies are bound to grow multifold. There will be more workload than ever. A human pen and paper system will not only be more time-taking but also more expensive as compared to AI and companies will try to save the maximum % of their profits. AI will ensure that number of employees gain in less amount of time. Have a look at the growth of companies like UltiPro and WorkDay and all your curiosities regarding this suggestion will be satisfied.
 
 Receptionists
This suggestion didn’t need much validation after Pam declared it way back in “The Office’. Modern technology companies and multinational corporations are increasingly doing away with office-wide telephone systems. This practice itself has taken the likelihood of automation to 96%.
 
 Couriers
This suggestion should no longer shock you for most of the couriers, and robots have already replaced delivery persons. Just like the sector of Compensations and Benefits Managers, this job will also ironically see a growth of 5%. Though the change in this sector will happen slowly, there is 94% likelihood that AI will soon take over altogether.

 Proofreaders
Nobody updated contents online nowadays without consulting proofreading software. They are everywhere nowadays. Ranging from Microsoft’s simple spelling check to Grammarly’s premium services, the services offered by software in this field are indispensable. There is already software that helps us with this task on an everyday basis. Thus, there is 84% likelihood that humans will lose out more jobs to robots in this sector too.
 
 Computer Support Specialists
The 12% likelihood of growth in this sector complements 65% likelihood of automation in the same. The internet has a lot of contents on various computer parts. Right from the hacks to the how-tos, there is now an answer to everything on the world wide web.  Many companies are going to do away with the humans employed for this job and are instead going to utilize AI to solve all related queries of the employees as well as the customers.

 Market Research Analysts
If you need a contemporary example of market research analysis taken over by a robot, let me introduce you to GrowthBot. Bestowed with brilliant AI, it can conduct market research on nearby businesses and competitors as quick as “1-2-3”. No doubt market research does play a crucial role in messaging, content and strategy but such successful examples of AI, companies will surely look for alternatives to human effort.
Automated AI and surveys compile all this information and make their collection much more manageable.
 
 Advertising Salespeople
There is a projected 3% decline in this industry. With the growth of the online worlds, advertising is moving further away from print and TV witch each passing day. There is no longer a need for companies to appoint salespeople to deal with the sales of the spaces for ads. The purchase of spaces for ads on social media can be easily made with the help of APIs and self-serve ad marketplaces. This is a much faster and easier mode of making money. This ease is reflected in 54% likelihood of the people employed in this industry to lose their bread and butter to robots.

 Retail Salespeople
Buyers these days are much more tech-savvy. Not only do they prefer to purchase stuff online, in the event of visiting a mall, but they are also very comfortable with self-checkouts. Moreover, salespersons have lost the power to influence people as they come to the mall already equipped with all the necessary information about the choices available to them and the product they want to buy. Amazon Go stores are an example of that.
If you thought AI restricts to assembly lines, think again. AI has taken over the world of sales and marketing by storm. Though many of the workers employed in the fields like editing and HR will retain their jobs because of the essential nature of their work, many of us might have robots taking over our offices for good.
