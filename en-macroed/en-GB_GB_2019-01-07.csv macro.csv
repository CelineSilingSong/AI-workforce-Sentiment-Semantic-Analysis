Is AI going to displace workers or come as a benefit to them?
Getty





Smart technologies aren’t just changing our homes; they’re edging their way into their numerous industries and are disrupting the workplace. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to improve productivity, efficiency and accuracy across an organization – but is this entirely beneficial? Many fear that the rise of AI will lead to machines and robots replacing human workers and view this progression in technology as threat rather than a tool to better ourselves.

Friend or foe?
With AI continuing to be a prominent buzzword in 2019, businesses need to realize that self-learning and black-box capabilities are not the panacea. Many organisations are already beginning to see the incredible capabilities of AI, using these advantages to enhance human intelligence and gain real value from their data.
As there is increasing evidence demonstrating the benefits of intelligent systems, more decision-makers in the boardroom are gaining a better understanding of what AI can really offer. Research conducted by EY explains “organizations enabling AI at the enterprise level are increasing operational efficiency, making faster, more informed decisions and innovating new products and services.”
PROMOTED
The first companies employing AI systems across the board will gain competitive advantage, reduce cost of operations and remove head counts. Whilst this may be a positive from a business perspective, it is obvious why this a worry for those working in roles at risk of displacement. The introduction of these technologies will likely trigger an issue with unions and job security due to the substantial operational changes.

Although AI will affect every sector in some way, not every job is at equal risk. PwC predicts a relatively low displacement of jobs (around 3%) in the first wave of automation, but this could dramatically increase up to 30% by the mid-2030’s. Occupations within the transport industry could potentially be at much greater risk, whereas jobs requiring social, emotional and literary abilities are at the lowest risk of displacement.
A positive future with artificial intelligence
Many businesses and individuals are optimistic that this AI-driven shift in the workplace will result in more jobs being created than lost. As we develop innovative technologies, AI will have a positive impact on our economy by creating jobs that require the skill set to implement new systems. 80% of respondents in the EY survey said it was the lack of these skills that was the biggest challenge when employing AI programs.

It is likely that artificial intelligence will soon replace jobs involving repetitive or basic problem-solving tasks, and even go beyond current human capability. AI systems will be making decisions instead of humans in industrial settings, customer service roles and within financial institutions. Automated decisioning will be responsible for tasks such as approving loans, deciding whether a customer should be onboarded or identifying corruption and financial crime.
Organisations will benefit from an increase in productivity as a result of greater automation, meaning more revenue will generated. This thus provides additional money to spend on supporting jobs in the services sector.
How to take advantage of AI
Due to the vast array of jobs that could be impacted by AI, it is fundamental to address the potential pitfalls of these technologies.

Business need to overcome the trust and bias issues surrounding AI by achieving an effective and successful implementation that makes it possible for everyone to benefit.
Governments must ensure that gains from AI are shared widely across society to prevent social inequality between those affected and unaffected by these developments. For example, this could be through increased investment into training.
With the additional cost-savings from implementing AI systems, employers should also focus on upskilling their current employees.

To properly leverage the power of AI, we need to address the issue at an educational level, as well as in business. Education systems needs to focus on training students in roles directly associated to working with AI, including programmers and data analysts. This requires more emphasis to be put on STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). Also, subjects centered around building creative, social and emotional skills should be encouraged. Whilst artificial intelligence will be more productive than human workers for repetitive tasks, humans will always outperform machines in jobs requiring relationship-building and imagination.
Artificial intelligence will change our world both inside and outside the workplace. Instead of focusing on the fear surrounding automation, businesses need to embrace these new technologies to ensure they implement the most effective AI systems to enhance and compliment human intelligence.Vishal MarriaI am the CEO of Quantexa, an enterprise intelligence company.

on Sept. 14In 2015, a man named Nigel Richards won the title of French-­language Scrabble World Champion. This was especially noteworthy because Richards does not speak French. What the New Zealander had done was memorize each of the 386,000 words in the entire French Scrabble dictionary, in the space of just nine weeks.Richards’ impressive feat is a useful metaphor for how artificial intelligence works—real AI, not the paranoid fantasies that some self-­appointed “futurists” like to warn us about. Just as Richards committed vast troves of words to memory in order to master the domain of the Scrabble board, state-of-the-art AI—or deep ­learning—takes in massive amounts of data from a single domain and automatically learns from the data to make specific decisions within that domain. Deep learning can automatically optimize human-given goals—called ­“objective ­functions”—with unlimited memory and superhuman accuracy.While limited in scope, deep learning is usable by everyone and powerful within a certain domain. It can help ­Amazon maximize profit from recommendations or Facebook maximize minutes spent by users in its app, just as it can help banks minimize loan-­default rates or an airport camera determine if a terrorist has queued up for boarding.The potential applications for AI are extremely exciting. Autonomous vehicles, for example, will dramatically reduce cost and improve safety and efficiency. But the rise of AI also brings many challenges, and it’s worth taking time to sort between the genuine risks of this coming technological revolution and the misunderstandings and hype that sometimes surround the topic.Tech Titans Leading in Artificial IntelligenceMore Videos0 seconds of 2 minutes, 34 secondsVolume 0%Press shift question mark to access a list of keyboard shortcutsKeyboard ShortcutsEnabledDisabledShortcuts Open/Close/ or ?Play/PauseSPACEIncrease Volume↑Decrease Volume↓Seek Forward→Seek Backward←Captions On/OffcFullscreen/Exit FullscreenfMute/UnmutemDecrease Caption Size-Increase Caption Size+ or =Seek %0-9

Live00:0002:3402:34 First, let’s talk about job displacement. Because AI can outperform humans at routine tasks—­provided the task is in one domain with a lot of data—it is technically capable of displacing hundreds of millions of white and blue collar jobs in the next 15 years or so.But not every job will be replaced by AI. In fact, four types of jobs are not at risk at all. First, there are creative jobs. AI needs to be given a goal to optimize. It cannot invent, like scientists, novelists and artists can. Second, the complex, strategic jobs—­executives, diplomats, ­economists—go well beyond the AI limitation of single-­domain and Big Data. Then there are the as-yet-unknown jobs that will be created by AI.Are you worried that these three types of jobs won’t employ as many people as AI will displace? Not to worry, as the fourth type is much larger: empathetic and compassionate jobs, such as teachers, nannies and doctors. These jobs require compassion, trust and ­empathy—which AI does not have. And even if AI tried to fake it, nobody would want a chatbot telling them they have cancer, or a robot to baby­sit their children.So there will still be jobs in the age of AI. The key then must be retraining the workforce so people can do them. This must be the responsibility not just of the government, which can provide subsidies, but also of corporations and AI’s ultra-wealthy beneficiaries.As well as job displacement, AI has the potential to multiply ­inequality— both between the ultra-wealthy and the displaced workers and also among countries. In contrast with the U.S. and China, poorer and smaller countries will be unable to reap the economic rewards that will come with AI and less well placed to mitigate job displacement.The technology also poses serious challenges in terms of security; the consequences of hacking into AI-­controlled systems could be severe—­imagine if autonomous vehicles were hacked by terrorists and used as weapons.Finally, there are the issues of privacy, exacerbated bias and manipulation. Sadly, we’ve already seen failures on this front; Facebook couldn’t resist the temptation to use AI technology to optimize usage and profit, at the expense of user privacy and fostering bias and division.All of these risks require governments, businesses and technologists to work together to develop a new rule book for AI applications. What happened with Facebook is proof that self-­governing regulatory systems are bound to fail. And rather than compete against one another, countries must share best practices and work together to ensure this technology is used for the good of all.One thing we don’t have to worry about is the fevered warnings of utopians and dystopians about AI making humans obsolete. The former predict we shall be “assimilated” and evolve into human cyborgs; the latter warn of world domination by robot overlords. Neither are showing much in the way of actual intelligence about artificial intelligence.The age of “artificial general intelligence”­—or when AI will be able to perform intellectual tasks better than ­humans—is far in the distance. General AI requires advanced capabilities such as reasoning, conceptual learning, common sense, planning, creativity and even self-­awareness and emotions, all of which remain beyond our scientific reach. There are no known engineering paths to evolve toward these general capabilities. And big breakthroughs will not come easily or quickly.Think back to Nigel Richards, who defeated the Francophone world at Scrabble. He had an amazing ability to memorize data and optimally select from permutations. But if you asked him to evaluate a novel by Gustave Flaubert, he would be completely lost. So asking when AI will entirely surpass humans is a little like asking when Richards will win the Prix Goncourt, France’s most prestigious literature prize. It’s not entirely ­impossible—but it is extremely unlikely.",https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/tS58KSFx/poster.jpg?width=720,"{'@type': 'SeekToAction', 'target': 'https://time.com/5501056/artificial-intelligence-protect-workers/?jw_start={seek_to_second_number}', 'startOffset-input': 'required name=seek_to_second_number'}",2018-07-11T20:40:55.000Z,https://cdn.jwplayer.com/manifests/tS58KSFx.m3u8,https://time.com/5501056/artificial-intelligence-protect-workers/,PT2M34S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The future of HR is both digital and human as HR leaders focus on optimizing the combination of human and automated work. This is driving a new priority for HR: one which requires leaders and teams to develop a fluency in artificial intelligence while they re-imagine HR to be more personal, human and intuitive.

As we enter 2019, it's the combination of AI and human intelligence that will transform work and workers as we know it.
I see the following ten HR trends leaders will need to prepare for as we enter 2019:
1. AI Plus Human Intelligence Enhances the Candidate Experience 
For many companies the first pilots of artificial intelligence are in talent acquisition, as this is the area where companies see significant, measurable, and immediate results in reducing time to hire, increasing productivity for recruiters, and delivering an enhanced candidate experience that is seamless, simple, and intuitive.
PROMOTED
One company that has delivered on this is DBS Bank. The DBS Talent Acquisition team created JIM (Jobs Intelligence Maestro), a virtual recruitment bot powered by artificial intelligence used to conduct candidate screening for those applying to be wealth planning managers, a high volume job in the consumer bank.

Following the introduction of JIM in May 2018, DBS talent acquisition was able to: 1) shorten the screening time from 32 minutes per candidate to 8 minutes per candidate, 2) improve completion rate of job application from 85% to 97% and 3) respond to 96% of all candidate queries through JIM, allowing recruiters to spend more time sharing the culture and values of DBS with candidates. While these metrics are impressive, says James Loo, Head of Talent Acquisition Group, DBS Bank, the key learning is that the use of artificial intelligence provides benefits for the recruiters as well.  Recruiters no longer need to spend hours to screen thousands of applicants, freeing them up to perform higher-value work such as sourcing, recruitment marketing, engaging with candidates, and hiring managers. In fact, DBS recruiters built a new skill: training the Chatbot to assess candidates and answer candidates’ queries. The future job of a recruiter may add that of  a Chatbot Coach!

The demand for uniquely human skills will grow, according to the Future of Jobs Report from the World Economic Forum.  The World Economic Forum projects that 75 million current jobs will be displaced as artificial intelligence takes over more routine aspects of work.
However, 133 million new jobs will be created, and skills in both emotional intelligence and  technical intelligence, like technology design and programming, will be important.
Figure 1 shows the Skills Demand in 2018 and Projected for 2022.

Some companies, like Bank of America, are building a national training program to teach empathy to the banks' front line client facing roles. 
John Jordan who leads The Academy and Advisor Development at Bank of America calls this a ""life stage navigation curriculum,"" assisting Bank of America financial advisors in better understanding the priorities of their customers in various life stages from young parent, to widower, to retiree. Jordan says, ""To date, almost 40,000 people have been through Academy programs, which all include some form of empathy training.""
According to Jordan, the need to develop empathy is growing as front line bank professionals must understand the concerns of clients at their life stage. There is also a business reason to develop empathy. Research from Center for Creative Leadership shows developing  emotional intelligence and empathy predicts better job performance for both front line employees as well as leaders.
3. Artificial Intelligence Won't Take Away Jobs But Help Workers Do Jobs Better 
Gartner estimates that artificial intelligence will create more jobs than it eliminates.  The focus for 2019 will be on deciding how to use AI to help workers do their jobs better. PwC forecasts 20% of executives at U.S. companies with artificial intelligence initiatives report that they will roll out AI across their business this year and expect AI investment to both re-imagine jobs and work processes as well as grow profits and revenue.
For HR leaders, we see this already happening. Oracle and Future Workplace conducted research with 600 HR leaders entitled AI At Work, to learn where AI was being used in the workplace to re-imagine candidate and employee experience.
Figure 2 shows how this sample of 600 HR leaders answered the question: Where is AI Being Used in HR?

Sarah Smart, Vice President of Global Recruiting says,""By using artificial intelligence to source, screen and interview candidates, we have increased our speed to hire by 85%.  We have also experienced other business benefits; such as increasing the diversity of our talent pool and enabling our recruiters to identify a high performing candidate faster. Having started our journey using AI in 2014, we see future use cases for AI include improving new hire onboarding and providing internal talent mobility for Hilton employees.""  To date, Hilton has invested in upskilling the recruiter rather than making the role redundant. Think of artificial intelligence as a tool in the recruiter’s tool belt to help them streamline the hiring process, while never making the final decision about hiring.
4. New Jobs Will Be Created Using Artificial Intelligence 
Creating new jobs as artificial intelligence becomes more widespread inside companies will be a huge priority for C-suite leaders in 2019.
The Center for the Future of Work at Cognizant Technology Solutions tackled this issue with  two reports, 21 Jobs for the Future and 21 More Jobs For the Future of Work.  These jobs have been organized from low tech to high tech over the 10-year horizon from 2019 to 2029.
Since the first report was released, many of the anticipated new jobs have come to life, such as Financial Wellness Managers, (which I profiled in Three New HR Roles in Age of AI featuring Financial Wellness Managers at Suntrust), to Memory Curator and Augmented Reality Journey Builder jobs currently at Facebook. 
Rob Brown, Associate Vice President at Center for the Future of Work at Cognizant Technology Solutions, shares the drivers behind the 21 More Jobs For the Future of Work: ""The vision behind our newest report is to profile futuristic jobs which leverage the power of artificial intelligence to blend technology with the ""human touch"" for jobs in the future workplace.""
Figure 3 presents the latest 21 More Jobs Of the Future.

21 More Jobs





Two of my favorites include:
Voice UX Designer: This role will leverage voice as a platform to deliver an “optimal” dialect and sound that is pleasing to each of the seven billion humans on the planet. The Voice UX Designer will do this by creating a set of AI tools and algorithms to help individuals find their “perfect voice” assistant.
Head of Business Behavior: The head of business behavior will analyze employee behavioral data such as performance data along with data gathered through personal, environmental and spatial sensors to create strategies to improve employee experience, cross company collaboration, productivity and employee well-being.
The question for HR leaders is: What are new job roles in HR that are on the horizon as A.I. becomes integrated into the workplace?
Chief Ethical and Humane Use Officer: This job role is already being filled by Salesforce announcing its first Chief Ethical and Humane Officer this month. This new role will focus on developing strategies to use technology in an ethical and humane way. As practical uses of AI have exploded in recent years, we look for more companies to establish new jobs focusing on ethical uses of AI to ensure AI's trustworthiness, while also helping to diffuse fears about it.
A.I. Trainer: This role allows the existing knowledge you have about a job to be ready for A.I. to use.  Creating knowledge for an A.I. supported workplace requires individuals to tag or ""annotate"" discrete knowledge nuggets so the correct data is served up in a conversational interface. This role is increasingly important as the role of a recruiter is augmented by AI.
5. An Artificial Intelligence Ready Workforce Will Be Critical To An Organization's Future 
As as we head into 2019 — with AI moving from consumers' lives into the workplace – upskilling non-AI workers to learn how to work with AI is becoming increasingly important. Developing an AI ready workforce involves five key initiatives:

Identify the business problem to solve using artificial intelligence and start collecting data on the current state of the problem and the key KPI you want to impact with AI.
Build a cross functional team of key stakeholders to educate them on the business benefits of using AI to solve key business problems.
Implement learning opportunities for key job roles impacted in HR by AI (such as those in Recruiting, New Hire On-Boarding and Corporate Learning).
Identify new jobs and skills needed as AI is leveraged in the workplace.
Change performance management and development skills needed in HR roles to include a fundamental understanding of how to use artificial intelligence across the employee life cycle.

When AI is leveraged in the organization, employees will need training  on how to work with their AI team members. This will grow in importance, as Gartner predicts that by 2022 (just three years from now!) one in five workers engaged in non-routine tasks will rely on AI to do their jobs. 
 As employees depend on the insights of AI to do their jobs, developing an AI ready workforce will be a competitive advantage.
6. Skills-Based Hiring Gains Traction 
In 2018, Future Workplace hosted a skills based hiring Hackathon where we asked, why weren’t more companies adopting skills-based hiring to widen the talent pool? Skills-based hiring is defined as the practice of setting specific skills and competency requirements for a job rather than rely solely on candidates' credentials. Today, more FORTUNE 1000 firms are going on record hiring candidates without a college degree as a requirement.
Figure 4 lists fifteen of these companies below:








Figure 4
Glassdoor





Skills-based hiring may start by changing a job description and removing a degree requirement, but it requires shifting mindsets on where and how a company sources talent. What’s needed is to change the mindsets of hiring managers and business leaders to source in new ways.  These new ways to source non-traditional candidates range from Boot Camps, Coding schools, MOOC's, Technical high schools like P-TECH (a joint high school diploma and associate degree in STEM), Job training conducted at community centers, high schools, or even sponsor a company wide Hackathon. Regardless of your industry, adopting a skills-based hiring approach requires educating business stakeholders, identifying benefits & barriers of widening the talent pool, and developing a strategy for both skills-based hiring as well as educational and learning pathways to upskill a more diverse employee population.
7. Workers Will Trade Money For Meaning at Work 
The experience of meaningful work is a personal one, as Gallup reports we are working on average 47 hours per week with one in five working more than 60 hours each week. Increasingly workers are searching for meaningful work, a workplace that aligns to their values and a supportive and healthy work culture.
A recent report entitled  entitled Meaning and Purpose at Work surveyed 2,285 American professionals, across 26 industries to find out how important having meaning was at work.
In fact, workers said they’d be willing to forego 23% of their entire future lifetime earnings in order to have a job that was always meaningful to them. This means that building greater meaning at work is no longer a ""nice to have,"" but a business imperative. Employees who find meaning at work are happier, more productive and hard working, and are absent less.
On average, American workers who place a higher value on meaningful work are in a more senior position, and if they are working in a company that offers meaningful work they stay longer. Employees who find work highly meaningful are 69% less likely to plan on quitting their jobs within the next six months, and have job tenures that are 7.4 months longer on average than employees who find work lacking in meaning.
As the quest for meaning in the workplace grows, more HR leaders are putting a greater emphasis on communicating their company's culture and sharing their purpose and meaning across the employee population. This involves creating opportunities from training to mentoring and coaching to promote a shared vision and a healthy and supportive work culture.
8. Two Powerful Employee Perks Emerge: Access To Natural Light And Career Development 
The news headlines about which perks create a compelling employee experience seem to be dominated by fads — think treadmill desks, nap pods, and “bring your dog to work day. ” However, a new survey by my firm, Future Workplace called “The Employee Experience” reveals employees crave something far more fundamental and essential to human needs. In a research poll of 1,614 North American employees, we found that access to natural light and views of the outdoors are the number one attribute of the workplace environment, outranking traditional benefits like onsite cafeterias, fitness centers, and premium perks including on-site childcare (only 4-8% of FORTUNE 100 companies offer on-site child care).  A great example of this is The Spheres, an Amazon workspace in downtown Seattle that’s a curated jungle with over 40,000 plants. Amazon’s Spheres relies on the premise that natural light, plant life, and healthy activities reduce employee stress and improve job satisfaction more so than a standard office building. (Note that in contrast to many of its peers, Amazon has chosen to invest in Spheres rather than other office perks such as free lunches and snacks).
In addition to designing the physical environment to promote employee well-being, companies are also creating more opportunities for internal career mobility. With more than 7 million jobs unfilled, companies are recognizing the importance of creating internal mobility and job rotation programs to keep employees motivated and engaged. Both MasterCard and Intuit stress career planning and invest in internal career mobility and navigation. The Wall Street Journal reports each company is a leader in their industry in terms of profitability. 
 
9. Virtual Reality Is Transforming Corporate Training 
A growing number of heads of global learning & development are piloting Virtual Reality (VR) to train employees. And the most interesting use cases revolve around using virtual reality for compliance training. Verizon is using virtual reality to train store managers on protocol in case there is a store robbery. Lou Tedrick, VP-Global Learning & Development, Verizon, says, ""We've found that virtual reality is the best way to effectively replicate learning experiences that were previously challenging or impossible, such as our Retail Store Robbery. The feedback we've received from our participants in these difficult learning scenario trainings justifies the additional investment involved in VR over a more traditional instructional method.""
In addition to Verizon, MasterCard is using virtual reality to help employees improve their soft skills as well as train them on what to do in a crisis situation, such as an active shooter in the workplace or a building fire. Walmart is also using virtual reality to train 1 million associates across 4,700 stores in the U.S. on various aspects of store operations from taking care of produce to handling crowds on Black Friday.
Virtual reality training has clearly expanded from early use by the Arizona Cardinals who started using virtual reality headsets to prepare for games, to the design of virtual reality learning experiences. Derek Belch, founder of STRIVR, and Scott Schneider, CEO of HTXLabs, both see companies no longer asking ""What can I use AI for?"" but rather ""How can I widely deploy AI across the organization?""
10. HR Call To Action: Preparing For The Future of Work Is a Team Sport 
Deloitte Capital Trends  reports  a key challenge for business leaders is the need to work more closely together: acting as a symphony of experts playing in harmony.
But, three-quarters of those surveyed said C-level executives do not agree on common priorities or in concert. Often, the CHRO focuses on HR, CIO on IT issues, CFO on numbers, CMO on marketing  — and now new C-level players are appearing – Chief Digital Officer, and Chief Ethical Officer. As the pace of change accelerates, it is more important than ever for C-level executives to agree  on a shared vision in the age of AI.
 Preparing for the future of work is a team sport.
Sahil Sahni, Co-Founder of AllyO sees the importance of this in working with clients. Clients need to build cross-functional alignment between CHRO, CIO, CDO and CMO in order to agree on the business problem that needs to be solved and this is especially important in the age of artificial intelligence.

The Impact of Artificial Intelligence in Business

While the changes that AI could bring are not yet fully understood, we know it has the capacity to change work as the world knows it.
The impact of artificial intelligence in business contexts isn't always clear-cut or easy to understand. However, today's business leaders should know a few things in order to be conversant on the topic of artificial intelligence (AI). What's the basic premise of AI, and how does it work? How will AI impact jobs and workers? What skills will be needed in an automated workplace?
The Basics of Artificial Intelligence

Inclusive Design Is Something We Can't Live Without


AI is a term that encompasses multiple types of computerized programs. In fact, someone talking about AI can be discussing anything from facial recognition tools powered by neural networks to machine learning that predicts the best word to use in a subject line to improve email open rates. According to Talent Tech Labs, ""To be true AI, the technology must first learn from known inputs, then derive additional layers of abstraction to reach predictions that refines itself as the machine learns.""
 


There are a few key areas of artificial intelligence worth understanding that fall under that broader category. The two types of AI technology most applicable to the business field today include:
 

Machine Learning — a type of AI that provides computers with the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It works by examining large volumes of data and uses patterns in that data to improve a program's understanding and resulting predictions. An example of this is your favorite video streaming service being able to predict what movies you will enjoy based on your previous views and activity. 
Natural Language Processing — technology that reads, understands and responds to conversational language. An example is a chat bot. It's valuable because it can extract data from ambiguous, unstructured data sets like conversations. Elements such as context and tone can also be interpreted by the computer. Common applications of this software today include translation and speech recognition.

 
The innovative algorithms that run these underlying technologies can be applied to numerous use cases, both consumer and business focused. These technologies could change the workplace as we know it.
How Artificial Intelligence in Business Affects Jobs
A LinkedIn article points out the highly dynamic nature of the U.S. jobs market: ""Finally, while 3.5 million jobs sound like a lot to lose, there are almost that many layoffs every two months in the United States, and another six million or so people voluntarily leaving their jobs. The American economy is both huge and dynamic; large numbers of jobs are lost all the time, and even more are created.""
 
There is no shortage of headlines about robots taking jobs. However, while there may be some jobs that are changed or eliminated, others will be created or enhanced. And while some of that creative destruction of jobs may be true, it's also true that history provides examples of how labor and work change when new technologies are introduced. 
 
Consider Google, Bing and other search engines. Prior to these tools being available, there was no way to easily find information on the internet. Today, these are essential technologies and new jobs have been created to support this shift. Search engine optimization has risen as a specific career discipline used to design more search-friendly websites, even though this job didn't even exist 20 years ago. 
We don't know how AI will ultimately impact all jobs, but it's logical to look at more routine jobs that can be mechanized as low-hanging fruit. This could mean anything from data analysis to manufacturing, but algorithms can target any task that is repetitive.
Skills That Matter in an Al-Driven Workplace
According to Pew Research Center, nearly two-thirds of Americans say computers will take over the work of humans, but paradoxically, 80 percent of Americans say it wouldn't affect their own jobs. People think their work is immune to this technological advance, but it simply can't be true that all jobs are going to remain unchanged by these new tools.
 
Hiring, engaging and retaining a skilled workforce is an essentially human process. While there is incredible value to having tools — whether artificially intelligent or not — involved in the workflow, there's also value to personal connection and the human touch. For example, when you have a problem with your power, cell service or home internet connection, would you rather be directed to an automated message or speak to a human?
 
The same is true for candidates and employees — they need human interaction, even if it's augmented by technology. Historically, changes in technologies lead to changes in skills and competencies. The following five skills could become increasingly valuable as more and more work is automated:

Dealing with ambiguity
Understanding the emotions of others
Leveraging credible expertise
Determining reliability of information sources
Influencing others

 
Overall, the important message to gather is this: while the changes that AI could bring are not yet fully understood, we know it has the capacity to change work as the world knows it. By understanding some of the areas of impact and ensuring the right skills are prioritized in your employees, you can maintain a proper balance of relying on machines and algorithms to handle some tasks while keeping the ""human"" element alive in your workforce.

Breaking the mould: Samira Korani on promoting Artificial Intelligence & Tech in Iran


 


Growing up in a country where traditional gender roles are still somewhat prevalent, Samira Korani, decided to break the mold of society’s standards and dive into a field of work no one considered she would. While Iran is seeing increasing numbers of women pursuing STEM fields, many women there continue to face the same challenges as their female counterparts around the world. Samira’s steadfast fixation on her dream, however, never left room for her to doubt her desire to help bring Iran into the future using artificial intelligence and machine learning.
Discovering her passion
Growing up as the only daughter with four brothers, Samira easily differentiated herself from her traditional family. While her parents encouraged her to pursue the arts and possibly marry at a young age, she found herself drawn to math and science. She developed a passion that would ultimately serve as catalyst into her career in tech.
“When I grew up, I started believing that we can use technology to predict our society’s changes and learn about our country’s past.”
This revelation led Samira to text mining. After receiving her Bachelor’s degree in Industrial Management and her Master’s degree Information Technology, Samira developed a better understanding of how text mining would be particularly helpful in Iran where the dominant language is Farsi.
Utilizing text mining with Farsi is particularly difficult due to the lack of text corpus, or large collections of electronic documents. A text corpus would serve as a primary source of data for research dealing with language, however, its limited supply makes it challenging to determine facts about Iran’s history.
Essentially text mining uses artificial intelligence (AI) technology to derive quality information from written text and transform it into quantitative learning material. Using Python Samira is able to generate new information from documents that can be converted into data for analysis.
Unfortunately, in Samira’s experience, the Iranian government still adheres to traditional practices and is slower to adopt new technologies, such as AI for data analysis. However, she does not let that slow her down.
As an instructor at Iran’s leading institution for engineering and physical science disciplines, Sharif University, Samira connects with an open source community discussing the importance of artificial intelligence. She also strives to mentor young women to change the traditional societal expectations and encourages them to pursue their dreams.
“In my field, they try to ignore me and they told me I couldn’t be a coder, but I am a hard worker, and I had a dream to work with technology. The future of science is artificial intelligence because humans and technology integrate with each other. It took a lot of hard work and not being disappointed easily to do what I do, but I will continue reach my goal.”

When a country like the UAE becomes the only nation in the world to have established a dedicated ministry for Artificial Intelligence (AI), it sends out a strong indication of the government's confidence in technological advancements and their ability to become the catalyst that will transform the country.Taking this a step further, the UAE also launched its Strategy for Artificial Intelligence which plays a big role in the country's Centennial 2071 objectives and future vision for the country. It is no surprise that such emphasis has been placed on AI. Spearheading the fourth industrial revolution, it continues to be a game-changer and has the potential to significantly raise economic growth rates across the Middle East. In fact, according to a report by Accenture, AI will add $182 billion in annual gross value add to the UAE's economy by 2035.On a corporate level AI has the power to boost business operations, augment customer solutions, and strengthen growth strategies. As a result, many of the UAE's corporates have been quick to rely on the strategic advantages of AI solutions to boost employment and business profitability from AI integration into their organizational structure.



While this all seems very positive, there are underlying concerns and ongoing uncertainty around the future of employment and the role that AI has to play in this. With AI set to take over thousands of jobs not only in the region but across the world, many are asking the obvious questions of what this means for workers, and if workers are at risk of losing their job in the near future.The reality presents something altogether different and progressive. AI has the ability to free workers from mundane tasks. Intelligent Automation enables greater worker productivity and innovation which frees workers up for new job opportunities. Industry experts believe that the seamless integration of human intelligence with machine intelligence is the key to business success. However, this will require a new realm of workforce skills– one that focuses on enhancing human expertise in the more emotional but necessary realms of empathy, negotiation and creative thinking. These human attributes perfectly complement automated technologies to give businesses an all-round formula for success.


Corporations that wish to adopt AI often face resistance due to the unknown. Many feel that it may affect their role or the future success of the company. What they overlook is that this can usually be overcome by greater awareness and education on the associated benefits. Over two thirds of workers in the Middle East realize this and consider it important to develop their own skills to work with intelligent machines. While there is still some ground to cover, the UAE's workers are open-minded about adjusting their skills to meet the needs of the future workplace. What is needed is for corporates to ensure the implementation of a rock-solid AI strategy to maximize the opportunity it presents.Are the UAE's corporations ready for AI adoption?A recent report by the Dubai Technology Entrepreneurship Campus (Dtec) and startAD prepared in collaboration with ArabNet found that corporations in the UAE are still new to experimenting with AI implementation. However, there are some innovative companies who are going ahead with experimentation and implementation even though they may not have a strategy in place.Organizations that have yet to deploy a formal AI strategy usually fall into two categories. First, companies that do not have a formal strategy yet are implementing AI; and second, companies that are implementing AI solutions while simultaneously working on developing a formal strategy. When considering AI, organizations must assess the risk and the ROI of AI adoption through a cost-benefit analysis as well as creating clear direction and guidelines that take into account their value proposition. Of course they must ensure that a budget is set aside for proper AI adoption.


AI will provide ample opportunities in shaping the workforce of the future and there are many organizations that are set to welcome this change. With the UAE government introducing and supporting AI initiatives rigorously, corporations will be in the position to plan their strategic transitionary journey in line with new and upcoming technological advancements that benefit their business operations.

Aside from ongoing and upcoming launches for Novartis, the company's pharma president Paul Hudson is excited about a digital shakeup hitting the industry. (Novartis)
SAN FRANCISCO—Artificial intelligence is a big buzzword in R&D right now, but at Novartis, it's hard at work in the sales department, too.Amid far more meetings with digital companies at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference this year, Novartis’ pharma CEO Paul Hudson said he expects 2019 to be the “beginning of the tech disruption” for pharma, in everything from marketing to supply chain.In past years at JPM, Hudson mainly checked out early-stage biotech companies for potential partnerships, he told FiercePharma. This year? It’s about half health-tech companies, he said.Obviously, Novartis is jumping right in, as part of CEO Vas Narasimhan's push to transform the entire company using digital tech. In the field, the drugmaker has equipped salespeople with an AI service that suggests doctors to visit and subjects to talk up during their meetings.The program's “virtual assistant” helps salespeople “plan better, move better and make sure when they show up to see a healthcare professional, they are talking about the things that the healthcare professional is absolutely interested in,” Hudson said.“When you turn up at the right time with the right things to say, they’re more interested and put more value in it, and our people like the fact that AI is running in the background helping them plan their day,"" he added.In the long run, the program will help the company become more efficient, Hudson said, also citing telemedicine and improved distribution systems as potential digital shakeups heading for the pharma industry.RELATED: Novartis wants more digital—and needs better compliance—and it's shuffling executives to do itUnder Narasimhan, Novartis has placed a big emphasis on digital. The company in 2017 appointed Bertrand Bodson as its first chief digital officer. In March, the drugmaker teamed with Pear Therapeutics to create software applications to treat patients with schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis. The partners just launched an opioid addiction app this week.

Of course, Novartis isn’t alone in its digital quest. Pfizer, Merck and GlaxoSmithKline also appointed their first chief digital officers over the past couple years, signaling how the trend is taking hold at top drug companies.RELATED: Chief digital officers land at Big Pharma—cue tech transformations, test innovations, corner officesMerck appointed former Nike executive Jim Scholefield as its digital lead, while GSK tapped former Walmart executive Karenann Terrell as its chief digital and technology officer. For GSK’s consumer unit, the company picked up former Google and L’Oreal executive Marc Speichert. Pfizer, for its part, named former Quest Diagnostics executive Lidia Fonseca to serve as chief digital officer under new CEO Albert Bourla.Editor's note: This story was updated to clarify details of the AI service.

It’s a new day not very far in the future. You wake up; your wristwatch has recorded how long you’ve slept, and monitored your heartbeat and breathing. You drive to work; car sensors track your speed and braking. You pick up some breakfast on your way, paying electronically; the transaction and the calorie content of your meal are recorded. 
Then you have a car accident. You phone your insurance company. Your call is answered immediately. The voice on the other end knows your name and amiably chats to you about your pet cat and how your favourite football team did on the weekend. 
You’re talking to a chat-bot. The reason it “knows” so much about you is because the insurance company is using artificial intelligence to scrape information about you from social media. It knows a lot more besides, because you’ve agreed to let it monitor your personal devices in exchange for cheaper insurance premiums. 
This isn’t science fiction. More than three-quarters of insurance executives believe artificial intelligence will revolutionise the industry within a few years. By 2030, according to McKinsey futurists, artificial intelligence will mean your car and life insurance premiums could change based on whether you decide to take one route or another.
It will be sold to you on the promise of more personalised service, faster claims processing and lower premiums – and it will deliver on those promises, for the most part. 
But there are ethical risks too – data privacy and discrimination among them. An  insurance company might use your data to figure out how much you would be willing to pay for cover. It might sell the information to a third party. The AI might decide you pose a greater risk because of your age, sex, income or ethnicity.
The internet of things
Though the insurance industry in general has an unenviable reputation for taking people’s money then refusing to pay, it is a highly competitive sector. The less agile will probably not survive against competitors using AI to stay profitable while lowering their premiums.
To offer lower premiums, an insurer needs to know an individual is, in fact, a lower risk. The enabling technology is the internet of things, the  collective name for the billions of internet-connected sensors embedded in all manner of objects we use every day. They are in phones, watches, cars, fitness trackers, home assistants and many other things. Collectively they form an “ecosystem” of sensors. 
Data collected over time allow the insurer to make an individually tailored risk profile based on a person’s actual behaviour, a practice known as behavioural policy pricing. 
Getting ‘smart’
To lower your house and contents insurance, the insurance company will patch into the AI hub that runs your “smart home” through its ecosystem of sensors. 
If there is a pattern of burglaries in the neighbourhood, the home hub will know, because it is connected to the insurer’s network. Locks and alarms can be primed and police called at the first sign of trouble. To manage the risk of fire, sensors will monitor heat, humidity and detect smoke. If the stove gets left on, the home hub will turn it off before it becomes a problem. 
To calculate lower car insurance premiums, your insurance company may want to monitor the way you drive and maintain your car. 
Health insurance premiums may require giving the insurer access to your medical records and wearing a fitness tracker.

A new industry sector will emerge. Specialist companies that deploy IoT sensors and gather the data will partner with insurers to form a new business ecosystem. The whole industry will shift from purely reactive insurance to proactive, risk-minimising cover.
It all sounds quite positive. But there are also broader risks in the narrow pursuit of minimising insurance risk.

Discrimination
One very clear danger is the problem of profiling – being judged a higher or lower insurance risk because you belong to a particular demographic group.
AI can now differentiate risk into hundreds of factors. Algorithms scan these factors to identify clusters of previously unrecognised risk. They can also deduce clusters on their own. 
But these conclusions may unintentionally discriminate. There are already many examples where AI algorithms have inadvertently amplified stereotypes. 
The case of predictive policing in Durham, England, illustrates the problem. Police there developed an algorithm to better predict the risk posed by people charged with an offence should they be granted bail. What it did was discriminate against poorer people on the basis of where they lived. 
Opportunistic pricing
There is also the prospect of more individualised discrimination. 
Already quite well known is the problem of genetic discrimination – the risk of a health or life insurer increasing premiums or even denying cover for certain conditions based on what your DNA reveals about your genetic disposition to certain conditions. 




      Read more:
      Australians can be denied life insurance based on genetic test results, and there is little protection




AI opens up a whole new area of personalised discrimination, based on what it can glean from your behaviours and preferences.
For one thing, the plethora of data potentially available to AI can tell an insurer a lot about your spending habits. Where do you shop? What do you buy? When do you spend? Do you seek out bargains or pay full price? 
Knowing all this will help an insurance company estimate if it can get away with charging you top price. 
Some in the industry argue that this is just how markets operate, but when it is facilitated by unprecedented access to personal information, it becomes a highly questionable practice.
Loss of privacy
An insurer might also be tempted to use the data for purposes other than assessing risk. Given its value, the data might be sold to third parties for various purposes to offset the cost of collecting it. Advertisers, marketers, lobbyists and political parties are all insatiably hungry for detailed demographic data. 




      Read more:
      What are tech companies doing about ethical use of data? Not much




Contrary to what people might think, this data is not the property of the person it relates to. It is owned by whoever paid for it. Consumers must be legally protected against their data being used for other purposes without their informed consent. 
Managing risk
With any powerful new technology there are benefits and risks. The benefits should be made clear and the risks managed down to an acceptable level. There is of course irony in having to manage the risk of managing risk. 
Insurance companies have a job to do to ensure customers can trust there is far more upside than downside in AI. They will need to adopt transparently fair, if not benevolent, practices that contribute to the greater good. It has to be about more than profit.

Forty percent of the world’s jobs could be done by machines in as soon as 15 years, according to a top expert on artificial intelligence (AI).
Kai Fu Lee, a pioneer in AI who also works in venture capital in China, told “60 Minutes” that a wide range of blue-collar and some white-collar jobs will be overtaken by machines in the next two decades.
“AI will increasingly replace repetitive jobs, not just for blue-collar work, but a lot of white-collar work,” Lee, who has worked for Apple and Google, told CBS. “Chauffeurs, truck drivers, anyone who does driving for a living — their jobs will be disrupted more in the 15 to 25-year time frame.”
The venture capitalist, who wrote a book about AI last year, said in the show that “many jobs that seem a little bit complex – chef, waiter, a lot of things – will become automated.”
Although technologists and futurists have made similar predictions about when AI will start gobbling up jobs before, the truth is harder to pin down. Currently, most AI, which is what powers things like Apple’s Siri and Google Home, is focused on relatively narrow tasks. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) would, in theory, be a machine or software program that could deftly handle highly complex tasks like writing novels or performing surgeries.

Pelley asked Lee what such a stunning technological development could do to society.
“Well, in some sense, there is the human wisdom that always overcomes these technological revolutions,” Lee explained. “The invention of the steam engine, the sewing machine, electricity, have all displaced jobs. We’ve gotten over it. The challenge of AI is this 40 percent, whether it is 15 or 25 years, is coming faster than the previous revolutions.”
In China, 70 percent of the country’s population uses a smartphone for a range of routine practices and transactions, but Lee told Pelley that the US is still China’s main competitor when it comes to developing the full potential of AI.

When Renée Bibby has a good hair day, people stop her on the street and tell her they love her short curly hair. On a bad hair day, though, “I look like a dandelion puff,” said Bibby, 41, a graphic designer in Tucson, Arizona.
Over the years, Bibby, who is of mixed-race descent and describes her hair as “coarse, but not black,” has spent hundreds of dollars trying products to maximize the good days and minimize the bad. Then, last year, she found a winner: a custom-made $25 conditioner from a startup called Prose. (She does not shampoo her hair.)
“The first day I used it, I got out of the shower and the curl was already in my hair,” said Bibby, who used to have to work to bring the curl back. “It’s probably taken 10 minutes off my routine.”

Prose, whose founders include a former L’Oréal vice president, uses a quiz, artificial intelligence algorithms and a 6,000-square-foot production space in the Sunset Park section of Brooklyn to create what it hopes is each customer’s ideal product.

The company has shipped 110,000 bottles and will reach $1 million in monthly sales by its first birthday in January, and it is one of the biggest and most successful entrants in what has fast become one of the hottest spaces in the beauty industry: customizable hair care. On Monday the company announced that it had raised $18 million in new funding.
Another startup, the 4-year-old Function of Beauty, uses its own quiz and algorithms (along with a Willy Wonka-esque 50,000-square-foot factory of custom-built machines). It has sold 1 million bottles, according to Zahir Dossa, a trained computer scientist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the company’s chief executive. (Prices start at $36 for an 8-ounce set of shampoo and conditioner.)
There is more competition coming. Schwarzkopf, a global cosmetics giant, is conducting trials of custom products in Japan (with plans to bring them to the United States). Its system includes a hand-held device with an infrared sensor that can detect the hair’s molecular structure and analyze its moisture levels. An in-salon machine that looks like the world’s fanciest coffee maker whips up products in 50 seconds, along with a label printed with a bar code for reordering.
Unlike brands that offer different products for each hair “goal” (say, preserving color or thickening hair), companies that customize say they can combine ingredients that will fulfill all your hair needs in a single shampoo, conditioner or hair mask.
Prose also adjusts based on environmental factors, which it gleans from your ZIP code. For example, if it thinks you may be spending a lot of time in indoor heating because it’s cold outside, it adds corn derivatives that smooth and condition to fight static.
“We tackle all your problems,” said Arnaud Plas, the chief executive of Prose, sitting in the company’s SoHo conference room, which is decorated with illustrations of coconut, mint and other good-for-hair ingredients. “We’re not going to make you compromise.” (The company says it has tested which ingredients could cancel one another’s benefits.)
It’s probably not surprising that there are skeptics. Maryanne Senna, a dermatologist and the director of the Hair Academic Innovative Research Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, is unconvinced that customizable shampoos and conditioners work much better than standard ones.
“There are some things we very clearly know can be drying, but then there’s a lot of stuff they use that has no evidence to back it up,” Senna said. “Whether it’s the hair holy grail comes down to perception.”
Unless patients have very oily hair or dandruff or a known sensitivity or allergy, she does not recommend specific products. She tells them that everyone is different, and they have to find one that works for them.
Perry Romanowski, a cosmetic chemist and a founder of thebeautybrains.com, a site where scientists examine product ingredients and industry claims, called customization “a marketing gimmick.”

“There is nothing measurably different about their formulas in terms of performance,” Romanowski said.
He has run blind home-use tests of the 10 top-selling shampoos and conditioners. Pantene turned out to make the best performing product.

Moreover, he found that expensive shampoos don’t work better than cheap ones, but expensive conditioners work better than really inexpensive ones, like V05 or Suave, he said. That’s because the pricey conditioners have more types of nourishing ingredients, which all work differently, and together are more effective.
Still, he said, “super-expensive ones aren’t better than Pantene.”
But this is where things get knotty. A major driver of whether a product works — or really, whether a customer thinks it does — is fragrance, which of course has no visible effect (unless you’re allergic to it). In its early days, Function of Beauty had to spend more time tweaking scents than algorithms.
“Man, people care a lot more about fragrance than I ever thought they would,” said Dossa, who, when he started the company, had a shaved head, but now has a man bun so he can test products. “Customers won’t properly assess your product if they’re not happy with the fragrance.”

Prose does not offer customers who want a moisturizing shampoo the option of choosing a citrus fragrance. Plas learned from his time at L’Oréal that customers will insist the product doesn’t work, because they associate that smell with grease removal. “Then we give them the exact same formula with a different scent, and they think it’s great,” he said, shaking his head.
Another thing customers can’t (yet) choose easily: to ban a particular ingredient because of allergies and sensitivities. (Function of Beauty is vegan and gluten free; Prose allows you to choose those options. Both allow you to avoid fragrance, but you have to contact customer service to ban a specific ingredient.)

Lacey Harris, 35, an athletic trainer in Lemoore, California, is allergic to coconut oil, an ingredient contained in her Function of Beauty products. She switched to Prose, which, purely by luck, didn’t add that to her shampoo and conditioner.
Harris said she could really tell how much volume and wave the Prose products added to her hair when she bought Dove, which she once used, to share with her husband on a backpacking trip.
“I couldn’t wait to get back to my custom shampoo,” she said.

Kate Saenko Works to Make Artificial Intelligence Intelligible


Kate Saenko, an associate professor of computer science, was spotlighted in a recent BU Research article discussing her work investigating how neural networks’ decision-making processes can be understood by and explained to humans. As artificial intelligence plays an increasingly important role in the lives of humans, its internal learning and reasoning processes need to become move understandable for humans. Saenko conducts experiments with both humans and computers to study how to best do this.

Manoj Saxena in conversation with Rob Wolcott, host of 3BillionSeconds. October, 2017, in Iceland.
Stevens/Wolcott, 3BS





In 1956, Nobel Laureate Herbert Simon infamously predicted, “Machines will be capable, within 20 years, of doing any work a man can do.” While Simon missed by over 40 years (and counting), Artificial Intelligence (AI) entrepreneur and investor Manoj Saxena believes this time is different. While hype obscures the near term, Saxena explains, “AI is not a 50-year trend. It’s a 500-year trend.”

Few have better perspective. In addition to leading early commercialization of IBM’s Watson from 2011 – 2014, Saxena has founded and scaled multiple AI-based companies and funds, including current venture Cognitive Scale.





In a wide-ranging conversation in Iceland in late 2017, Saxena and I parsed AI fiction from reality (see our interview here). We met thanks to Emmet B. Keeffe III’s Insight IGNITE, a digital acceleration program he founded as a partner at global venture firm Insight Venture Partners. Ignite convenes leaders from across the enterprise technology arena in compelling locations to explore the future.
PROMOTED
Beyond AI False Starts
According to Saxena, “We’ve had a few AI winters. Most of those were focused on modeling the world or modeling the mind.” Given our limited understanding of how human intelligence works, much less how we make sense of the world, such a broad objective as re-creating general intelligence contributed to hyperbole and disappointment.

Somewhere around 2016, he argues AI hit an inflection point. Saxena’s cites two reasons for optimism: the resurgence of ‘learning loops’ as fundamental for AI and the fact that AI has become practical for a rapidly expanding range of business and life decisions.
AI thrives when it’s not just relying on hard-coded instructions, as was typical of most GOFAI (good old fashioned AI), but when it can learn from interactions. The evolution of neural networks-- first demonstrated by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957 but abandoned by most researchers until the 1980s-- machine and deep learning enables AI to advance in response to interactions.

Meanwhile, a torrent of venture funding over the past few years, including from Saxena’s own fund, The Entrepreneurs’ Fund, amplifies the search for practical applications. He advises, “A little AI goes a long way. Figure out how a business process works, then let’s apply AI.”
From Audacious Experiments To Practical Progress
Ironically, his practical advice—find tangible problems to tackle-- becomes more useful when researchers push the horizons of possibility. Audacious goals can catalyze progress.

Wolcott, 2018.




For example, IBM’s Jeopardy project was more than just a publicity stunt. From a research perspective, the challenges to demonstrate a working open-domain artificial intelligence system were enormous. On a recent visit to IBM’s Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown, New York, IBM’s head of Consulting Strategy and Cognitive Assets, Jesus Mantas, explained that winning the game show was about challenging what was possible. “After the research team’s success, IBM asked, ‘How do we apply Watson for business value?’” Saxena led this effort for IBM from 2011 – 2014, building initiatives in fields from healthcare to logistics.
Considering the next decade, Saxena envisions pivotal progress regarding one weak link of computational systems— humans. Our interfaces are notoriously slow. “The weakest link for AI is the last foot. It’s the 100k per second that you can feed your brain.” Solving the brain computer interface challenge transforms the potential for AI-enabled solutions. “The world is going to become our browser. We will become the cursor.”
AI Chuckies With Knives… And A Cambrian Explosion 
I’ve often been impressed by Saxena’s ability to synthesize historical and ethical insights with the practicalities of business and technology. Successful entrepreneurs and technologists act on practical insights, but too often lack a sense—or care— for how their actions might impact humans, society or humanity.

When I asked what most concerns him about the next decade in AI, Saxena opined about AI’s risks. “If we don’t design the systems properly or govern the systems with the right kill switch, you could have thousands of little Chuckies running around with knives in their hands,” in reference to the fictional slasher film character.

Stevens/Wolcott, 3BS





Saxena directly engages these issues. In addition to his personal attention, he recently endowed a faculty chair in responsible AI at his alma mater, Michigan State University’s Broad College of Business. In particular, he’s concerned about application and access. AI could end up “making the rich richer and… the evil more evil.”
Alloyed with wise concern, Saxena’s enthusiasm shines. Mixing two colossal metaphors, he predicts we’re witnessing “a Cambrian Explosion of innovation. Ten years from now, we will look back and say that we had a digital Florence movement. What Florence went through with the Renaissance.”
With Saxena’s metaphors as a guide, perhaps AI will be more than a 500-year phenomenon. With AI’s rapid advance, perhaps a few of us might remain cognizant enough to find out.

""More than electricity.""It's Different This TimeNew technology always renders some forms of labor obsolete. But displaced workers have historically had, in theory, the opportunity to pursue jobs the new industries technology created.But in his most recent book, ""AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order,"" Lee argues that AI displacement will be fundamentally different.In a November interview with Futurism, Lee explained that AI will allow entire new industries to be built from the ground up with automation in mind — not only will AI prove cheaper than human employees, but many of the new jobs it creates will be automated as well.Time to PrepareLee told CBS that this wave of automation and worker displacement will happen much more quickly than others, such as the invention and distribution of the steam engine.Part of that is because AI algorithms can be shared around the world among developers and business leaders with little need for new infrastructure. No railroads or highways or power grids need to be built.What's left to be determined, Lee said, is whether the best moneymaking AI will come from America, which houses most of the top AI developers, or China, where smartphone apps like WeChat give businesses rich data on nearly all aspects of users' lives.READ MORE: Venture capitalist: AI will displace 40 percent of world's jobs in as soon as 15 years [CBS News]More on Kai-Fu Lee: To Bolster Cybersecurity, France Gives Google the GuillotineShare This Article",https://wordpress-assets.futurism.com/2019/01/google-ai-jobs.png,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://futurism.com/the-byte/google-ai-jobs'}",,,,,,,2019,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', '@id': 'https://futurism.com#organization', 'url': 'https://futurism.com', 'description': 'Science and Technology News and Videos', 'foundingDate': '2015-11-25', 'masthead': 'https://futurism.com/masthead', 'name': 'Futurism', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'height': '60', 'width': '191', 'url': 'https://futurism.com/schema/OrgFuturism.png'}}"

Review: ‘The Metamorphosis’ by Frank Kafka remarkably stands the test of time
by Nishka Gouri | Arts and Entertainment, Featured “The Metamorphosis” by Frank Kafka is a thought-provoking, phenomenal story, with surreal occurrences and absurd themes. Published in 1915, sitting as a mere 75 pages; it is truly a worthwhile read. It focuses on Gregor Samsa, a...

Sign UpCancelOKIn the interest of serving you better with Office 2019, Microsoft wants to see your content. Content (Microsoft’s word, not mine) refers to the words, numbers, and other data in Office 2019 files. If Microsoft’s artificial intelligence (AI) software can read your content, the thinking goes, Microsoft can improve your Office experience. Microsoft can deduce from your history with Office what you like and want to do next. To trust or not to trust Microsoft, that is the question. Some Office 2019 features run only if you trust Microsoft with your content:

Tell Me: In all Office applications, completes a task or suggests how to complete a task. Click “Tell Me What You Want to Do” on the menu bar.
Editor: In Word, identifies words that might be misunderstood and presents alternative words — like a high-powered spell checker.
Smart Lookup: In Word, opens a task pane with word definitions and links you can click to conduct research online. On the References tab, click the Smart Lookup button.
Translator: In Word, translates words and documents into English. On the Review tab, click the Translate button.
Dictate: In Word, PowerPoint, and Outlook, takes dictation. Click the Dictate button.
Insights: In Excel, analyzes data on the fly. On the Insert tab, click the Insights button.
PowerPoint Designer: In PowerPoint, suggests designs that are appropriate for you based on your history with slide designs. On the Design tab, click the Design Ideas button.

Microsoft calls these Office features “intelligent services.” If you don’t trust Microsoft with your content and you try to use an intelligent service, you see the dialog box above. Click the Turn On button in this dialog box to trust Microsoft with your content.And what if you don’t trust Microsoft? Some people get squeamish when an artificial-intelligence robot peers over their shoulder. Some people get the willies knowing that their private data is available to a faceless corporate behemoth.Follow these steps to trust or not trust Microsoft with your Office 2019 content:

On the File tab in any Office application, choose Options.
The Options dialog box opens.
Select Trust Center on the left side of the dialog box.
Click the Trust Center Settings button.
Select Privacy Options on the left side of the dialog box.A list of privacy options appears. The first option is the one that matters where your content is concerned.
Select the first option (Get Designs, Information…) if you want Microsoft to be able to read data in your Office files.In other words, choose this option if you trust Microsoft.
Select the second option (Let Office connect…) if want Microsoft to be able to connect your files to Microsoft websites such as Bing and Bing Maps, and third-party websites such as Wikipedia.While you’re in the Trust Center, you can click the Read Our Privacy Statement link to open a web page that describes how Microsoft collects personal data and what the company does with this data. It makes for very dry reading.
Click OK in the Trust Center dialog box.
Click OK in the Options dialog box.
