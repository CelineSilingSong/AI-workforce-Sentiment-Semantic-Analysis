 Get it sent to your inbox.The Chinese government has drawn wide international condemnation for its harsh crackdown on ethnic Muslims in its western region, including holding as many as a million of them in detention camps. Now, documents and interviews show that the authorities are also using a vast, secret system of advanced facial recognition technology to track and control the Uighurs, a largely Muslim minority. It is the first known example of a government intentionally using artificial intelligence for racial profiling, experts said.The facial recognition technology, which is integrated into China’s rapidly expanding networks of surveillance cameras, looks exclusively for Uighurs based on their appearance and keeps records of their comings and goings for search and review. The practice makes China a pioneer in applying next-generation technology to watch its people, potentially ushering in a new era of automated racism.The technology and its use to keep tabs on China’s 11 million Uighurs were described by five people with direct knowledge of the systems, who requested anonymity because they feared retribution. The New York Times also reviewed databases used by the police, government procurement documents and advertising materials distributed by the A.I. companies that make the systems.

This is “The Daily.”Today: Under Xi Jinping, China is pioneering a new form of governance by surveillance. In the first of a two-part series, my colleague Paul Mozur on how China piloted that system on one minority group in the country. It’s Monday, May 6.Hi.paul mozurHi.michael barbaroHeadphones.Paul, we’ve actually never met. You are in town from China. I’m hoping you’re going to tell me why.paul mozurYeah, so I’ve been reporting in and around China for about 12 years. And there’s always been a lot of control. I think people are aware of that. They’re aware there’s censorship. They’re aware that people can be followed, and there is a certain amount of surveillance. But in the past five years, things have really changed and taken a much more dramatic and darker turn, really, when it comes to, especially, surveillance. And that coincides with the rise of Xi Jinping. China’s president who came into power about five years ago has really doubled down on control. And he has been not shy at all about using technology to exert that control. And there’s a lot of things that are invisible in how that works, but one of the very few visible symptoms are the cameras. There were always some cameras in China, but recently, past couple of years, the cameras have just gone in in this dramatic way. Some of them look like these baroque modernist sculptures or something. It’s like four cameras stretching off of a different pole, or you have a camera hanging from a tree. There’s these almost hidden cameras in the subway cars, these little holes. And if you look closely at them, you say, oh, my God, that’s actually a lens. I counted the cameras on my way to work one day, which is a two-subway-stop ride. And I passed, I think, 250 cameras.michael barbaroWow.paul mozurYeah.michael barbaroIn what kind of places? Where are you seeing them?paul mozurAll kinds of places. Every intersection will have dozens of cameras to catch people’s license plates as they drive by. About every 50 yards, you’ll have a camera on a pole that’s a dome camera that can zoom in and grab their faces or follow somebody if you have to. And when you walk down stairs, there’s these high-powered facial recognition cameras aimed at your face, with the idea of trying to figure out who you are as you walk by.michael barbaroAnd who’s on the other side of those cameras?paul mozurYeah, it’s what I always wonder. We don’t always know. And this is the thing about China, is that it is an autocratic system with very little transparency. For the most part, what we assume is a newly empowered police force is using these to try to learn as much as they can about the population and track them.michael barbaroBut to the degree that there’s a rationale for this, what is it?paul mozurSecurity. Safety. We want to make sure that if something bad were to happen in our neighborhood, we could protect ourselves. But in some recent reporting, what we discovered is the true breathtaking ways in which the police are already assembling lists of faces of people that they’re worried about, and even using it to mark people based on ethnicity and race, and track them and keep a record. It’s as if you were just counting only one group of people as they went around a city and keeping tabs so that you can go back and see which person that was. And in America, this would be horrendously unconstitutional. But in China, it had been happening for almost two years without anybody even noticing.michael barbaroAnd why would China want to do that? Why would it track a group of people by race through cameras and this classification system?paul mozurRight. So China has had this long issue with a Muslim minority known as the Uighurs, who live out in western China, this massive province, a fifth the size of China’s landmass, called Xinjiang. It’s mostly desert and really high mountains. It’s the old Silk Road. And these people have lived there for more than 1,000 years in these tiny little oasis cities around the desert. And China has occupied their land for several hundred years now. And as China has occupied it, for the most part, until maybe the past 50 or 60 years, it’s mostly just been a far-flung place. But under the Chinese Communist Party, they’ve really solidified power. And they’ve started to change the demographics. So they’ve created all these passive incentives to move Han Chinese into this region.michael barbaroTo basically make it less Muslim? More Chinese?paul mozurExactly. And so, 50 or 60 years ago, there were almost no Chinese, and it was all Uighurs. Now it’s 50 percent Chinese, 50 percent Uighur. And that’s created all of these conflicts.But everything really changed in 2009. What happens is, there’s violence in this small factory in southern China. And it turns out that there was a rumor that these two Uighur factory workers raped a Chinese woman, and then when the ethnic Chinese confront the Uighur population at the factory, a big fight breaks out, where, ultimately, two Uighurs end up beaten to death.archived recording[SHOUTING]paul mozurAnd there’s a video of this on YouTube, and it goes around.archived recording[SPEAKING MANDARIN]paul mozurAnd in a tinderbox like Xinjiang, where you have all of these other tensions there, it becomes one of the main causes for this massive outburst of rioting and anger in the capital of Urumqi.Thousands of Uighurs take to the streets, some with knives, and they murder about 200 Han Chinese.michael barbaroWow.paul mozurSo it’s a brutal and large-scale race riot.archived recording[SHOUTING]paul mozurAnd following that, the military is mobilized. The internet is cut off in Xinjiang, so you cannot get online. Even phone calls outside the country are no longer allowed. It’s a new level of suffocating technological response. And so in the ensuing decade, what they’ve tried to do is figure out methods to systematize it. And so they’ve turned to the police, and they’ve turned to technology.michael barbaroHave you been back there recently?paul mozurYes. So I went back in October to Kashgar.It’s a transformed place. It’s one of the most bizarre places I think I’ve ever been. We’re, of course, followed by secret police wherever we go. There are checkpoints every couple hundred yards. And they’ve created these things called convenience police centers. So think of a convenience store, but it’s a police station instead. So these small concrete boxes with constantly flashing lights. And they’re every couple hundred yards, and police are in them. And they’ll set up checkpoints there. But the idea is to blanket the city with this very suffocating level of police presence and surveillance. This is an old, mud-brick city, filled with bazaars.And now what you have is that look with these tremendously powerful facial recognition cameras hanging from a mud-brick wall, and there are cameras absolutely everywhere.And so you have this very bizarre contrast of a place that in some ways feels like it could be timeless and 1,000 years old, with these hyper-modern technological solutions attempting to understand and track the populations.michael barbaroSo tell me about that tracking. So clearly, China is very anxious that this Muslim population is going to revolt or just generally disobey the desires of the Chinese government. So how does that translate into this surveillance apparatus? What are they going to do with the image of a Muslim man or woman in this place that’s going to stop that?paul mozurWell, so they’ve already thrown about a million people in camps.michael barbaroLabor camps?paul mozurWell, they call them re-education camps. And we don’t have a lot of understanding of what happens inside. But it seems to be day-long classes and people being made to sit and hear Chinese Communist Party theory and propaganda and things like that. They need excuses to put people in these places. So if you have this massive surveillance system, you can find people that you think might be dangerous or might be risky. But the thing is, it’s so over the top and so extreme, people get thrown in because they’re an academic, because they’re influential, because they use technology, because they wouldn’t shave their beard, because they read the Quran. There’s a million different ways. What they’ve done is just tracked everybody all the time in a way that nobody even can go out their door without feeling the weight of the gaze of the state.michael barbaroRight. Everything you just described would be something that you could capture on camera. You would see someone with a beard. You might see someone reading the Quran. And that could be the trigger.paul mozurRight. And they’ve hung lots of cameras in mosques. So the Id Kah Mosque is this beautiful, mustard yellow mosque that sits in the center of old Kashgar. It’s the heart of Uighur Islam. And I think I counted more than 200 cameras inside the mosque, trying to capture worshippers who would come and go. And there aren’t many worshippers anymore, of course, because who’s going to go walk in front of those cameras and show their faces? And then that very easily can just go into a database, and then they have a data point. They know that Michael was right outside the Id Kah Mosque at this time. And then when he leaves the Id Kah Mosque, he’ll have to give his ID again. And then when he goes down to the marketplace, he has to give his ID again. And that way, you can build a comprehensive map of where you’re going. If you want to go to the bank, if you want to go to a grocery store, you have to do this. If you want to enter the old city, you have to do it. And so, it effectively just makes it impossible to do anything in this society without constantly giving up your private information to the state and to the police.michael barbaroAnd what you’re describing is the definition of dystopia.paul mozurYeah. And it goes even deeper than this. Around 2017, 2016, in Kashgar, we’ve heard that many people were called in for compulsory medical checkups. And they never got the results of the medical checkup. But what the medical checkup was was they had to give a blood sample, and their faces were scanned. And they had to give a voice sample, irises were scanned. And so just a mass collection of a single ethnicity’s biometric information. And we don’t really know entirely what they’ll do with all of that. In our reporting, we’ve seen parts of this. We’ve seen some of the dossiers. And so they can map people’s family relationships.michael barbaroWow. And what might the Chinese government do with that information? About family members, all those connections?paul mozurThey use it to lean on people. And they use it to intimidate people. And they use it to show that they are so powerful that there would be no point, in a way, to resist or push back. And you could see it in the population, the fear.michael barbaroI’m trying to understand where this leads to, because this doesn’t seem like an effort to acculturate people or to encourage them toward a Chinese identity. If anything, the people who are being subjected to this would most likely resent the Chinese government, right?paul mozurRight. I think the thinking goes further than that. The hope is ultimately to, I think, change the population fundamentally — to re-engineer a new way of life for these people that is basically Chinese. And I think the ultimate goal here is to eradicate Uighur culture. And the thing is, if they fail, well, then they have a culture so completely in their control that it’s no longer a threat in any way.michael barbaroPaul, what’s the relationship between what’s happening to the Uighurs and the larger surveillance state in China? If the rest of China is already Chinese, how does this all connect?paul mozurSo a lot of people like to call Xinjiang the laboratory for Chinese surveillance. So if you have any kind of draconian solution to tracking somebody or figuring out what somebody is doing on their phone, you can try it out in Xinjiang, and then see what happens. In Xinjiang, they can get away with a lot more, because you have an ethnic minority that is already so beset that they can’t really push back.michael barbaroA group without any power.paul mozurRight, exactly. In the rest of China, you see something that’s a little bit more passive, but you see a constant creep.On the subway, for instance, you start to see more checkpoints. The police just sit out where people are transferring, and they just stop people at random, and they scan their ID card, just like what happened in Xinjiang. And one of the things our reporting showed is that it’s not just Uighurs they’re looking for in these cities. They’re making lists of people’s faces depending on what kind of group they are. So they are making lists of the mentally ill. They’re making lists of people with a past history of drug use. They’re making lists of people who would petition the government or complain about the government. But they also have lists of every single person registered to live in that city. So the idea isn’t just to track these small groups. It’s to track everyone, with the idea that if somebody were to get out of line, then you know everything about them to begin with.michael barbaroSo this is about every single person in China?paul mozurYes.[music]michael barbaroI’m struck that all of this is happening at the same time that China is becoming a world power whose influence is growing so much overseas, because those things don’t quite seem to be consistent. In fact, they seem to be very contradictory.paul mozurRight. And I think they’ve basically proved that wrong, that you can have censorship and you can have a closed society, in some ways, and a controlled society, but also have a booming tech sector. And this is the first time in probably 30 years that we’ve had an autocratic state alongside the United States at the cutting edge of technology. So if you think about it, democracies have dominated technological creation since the fall of the Berlin Wall, effectively. Now China’s coming along, and they’re making technologies, but these technologies are suited for their purposes. And in a lot of cases, those purposes have some authoritarian component to them, or some point of control to them. Very intentional control. And in fact, as they’ve risen, they’ve used all of this as a selling point. So think to the Beijing Olympics in 2008. This is China’s coming-out party as a new superpower.[music]paul mozurThey’ve outfitted the capital with tons of security to make sure it goes well, to make sure there’s no protests, but also to make sure there’s no attacks or anything. And so they load up the city with 300,000 cameras that the government was controlling.michael barbaroBecause, of course, this is a moment where you actually do want a lot of security.paul mozurYeah, exactly. Yeah. So they really pulled out all the stops.But then what they did when all these international leaders arrived to see the Olympics is they took them into the back rooms where you could see all these cameras operating. They show the screens. They show, this is how our policing system works.michael barbaroSo who is in there?paul mozurSo we don’t know everybody that visited. But what we do know is that countries like Ecuador sent delegations — places that might be struggling with democracy or even already being led by strongmen, who have come to check this out. And there’s screens up with video footage from these thousands and thousands of cameras. And they can see how the Chinese security forces can see everything. They look at it, and they say, well, this is pretty powerful. I wonder if we could get this. And that’s where it starts. And so now what we’re seeing is those technologies are beginning to flow to the world. And so all of a sudden, on the streets of Quito, you see the same cameras that you would see in Shanghai. And that’s not just happening there. That’s happening in Venezuela. That’s happening in Bolivia. That’s happening in Angola. That’s happening in Pakistan. It’s happening around the world.michael barbaroPaul, what do you make of this global spread of surveillance, starting in China? What does it tell you about the changes you’ve seen in China in recent years and where all this is headed?paul mozurIt tells me that, I think, the Chinese government believes it has created a different model and a new model, and they want to propagate it. They want to spread it. And they want to give other countries the ability to do what they’ve done and, in that way, influence the world. So this is — governance by data, governance by mass surveillance, is, in a way, the Chinese model now, and they want to bring it to the world. And what this encourages is authoritarianism, because it uses technology unapologetically to consolidate power by understanding what everybody’s doing and where they are at any given moment. And I think it’s an important moment for democracies like the United States, because they need to recognize this is happening, but also say, well, what does the United States stand for in all this? Do they stand for data collection, as well, without telling anybody? Do you stand for something else? Because the United States at this point is so lost in its own debates —michael barbaroRight. So do we stand in contrast to that?paul mozurRight. Exactly. And that’s the thing — as I write about this from China, it’s unclear where the United States stands in all of it.michael barbaroIn a world where this model that you’re describing is spreading around the world, how exactly does China benefit from that? Because there are fewer and fewer places where a democratic government without surveillance challenges it?paul mozurI think the idea is if you give the people you’re dealing with these systems, you increase their power. And that means the people you’re dealing with are more likely to keep dealing with you and be the ones in power. So there’s a sort of perpetuation. But I think there’s also just a broader sense of the more countries around the world that do this, the more it’s deemed acceptable by the world, and the more that they have reliable partners who are following what they’re doing and reliant on them and allow them to push how governance works. And so in a way, they become the axle, and all of these different places become the spokes in this wheel, the new version of global governance, a new alternative to the messy democracies of the past.michael barbaroGovernance by data.paul mozurGovernance by data and surveillance.michael barbaroPaul, thank you very much.paul mozurThanks.michael barbaroOn Sunday, The Times reported that the Trump administration has decided not to confront China over its repressive treatment of the Uighurs, for fear that it could disrupt the final stages of a major trade deal between the two countries. The administration had considered imposing economic sanctions on Chinese officials involved in the repression, but has since backed away from that plan. In Part 2, we’ll hear from one Uighur man living in the U.S. who is trying to fight for his family in the camps in China.We’ll be right back.[music]michael barbaroHere’s what else you need to know today.On Sunday, fighting between Israel and Gaza escalated into the worst combat since the full-blown war between them in 2014. Four Israeli civilians were killed by Palestinian rocket and missile attacks, prompting Israel to take aim at individual militants in Gaza, killing at least nine of them and as many civilians.archived recording (benjamin netanyahu)[SPEAKING HEBREW]michael barbaroDuring a news conference, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, promised massive attacks against the militants in Gaza.archived recording (benjamin netanyahu)[SPEAKING HEBREW]michael barbaroThe Palestinian rocket attacks mostly struck civilian targets in southern Israel with no military value, including a building that houses a kindergarten and the oncology department of a medical center. The violence is the latest in a long-running series of clashes that have produced temporary ceasefires that are quickly broken. And President Trump on Sunday said that Special Counsel Robert Mueller should not testify before Congress, setting up another confrontation with congressional Democrats, who have requested Mueller’s appearance. In a tweet, the president said that Mueller’s report was conclusive and that Americans do not need to hear from him again. “No redos for the Dems,” he wrote.

See you tomorrow.Listen · 23:18 minChinese authorities already maintain a vast surveillance net, including tracking people’s DNA, in the western region of Xinjiang, which many Uighurs call home. But the scope of the new systems, previously unreported, extends that monitoring into many other corners of the country.

Law enforcement in the central Chinese city of Sanmenxia, along the Yellow River, ran a system that over the course of a month this year screened whether residents were Uighurs 500,000 times. Police documents show demand for such capabilities is spreading. Almost two dozen police departments in 16 different provinces and regions across China sought such technology beginning in 2018, according to procurement documents. Law enforcement from the central province of Shaanxi, for example, aimed to acquire a smart camera system last year that “should support facial recognition to identify Uighur/non-Uighur attributes.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSome police departments and technology companies described the practice as “minority identification,” though three of the people said that phrase was a euphemism for a tool that sought to identify Uighurs exclusively. Uighurs often look distinct from China’s majority Han population, more closely resembling people from Central Asia. Such differences make it easier for software to single them out.For decades, democracies have had a near monopoly on cutting-edge technology. Today, a new generation of start-ups catering to Beijing’s authoritarian needs are beginning to set the tone for emerging technologies like artificial intelligence. Similar tools could automate biases based on skin color and ethnicity elsewhere.“Take the most risky application of this technology, and chances are good someone is going to try it,” said Clare Garvie, an associate at the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law. “If you make a technology that can classify people by an ethnicity, someone will use it to repress that ethnicity.”From a technology standpoint, using algorithms to label people based on race or ethnicity has become relatively easy. Companies like I.B.M. advertise software that can sort people into broad groups. AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBut China has broken new ground by identifying one ethnic group for law enforcement purposes. One Chinese start-up, CloudWalk, outlined a sample experience in marketing its own surveillance systems. The technology, it said, could recognize “sensitive groups of people.” ImageA screen shot from the CloudWalk website details a possible use for its facial recognition technology.

Often, their accuracy depends on environmental factors like lighting and the positioning of cameras.In the United States and Europe, the debate in the artificial intelligence community has focused on the unconscious biases of those designing the technology. Recent tests showed facial recognition systems made by companies like I.B.M. and Amazon were less accurate at identifying the features of darker-skinned people.China’s efforts raise starker issues. While facial recognition technology uses aspects like skin tone and face shapes to sort images in photos or videos, it must be told by humans to categorize people based on social definitions of race or ethnicity. Chinese police, with the help of the start-ups, have done that.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“It’s something that seems shocking coming from the U.S., where there is most likely racism built into our algorithmic decision making, but not in an overt way like this,” said Jennifer Lynch, surveillance litigation director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “There’s not a system designed to identify someone as African-American, for example.”The Chinese A.I. companies behind the software include Yitu, Megvii, SenseTime, and CloudWalk, which are each valued at more than $1 billion. Another company, Hikvision, that sells cameras and software to process the images, offered a minority recognition function, but began phasing it out in 2018, according to one of the people.The companies’ valuations soared in 2018 as China’s Ministry of Public Security, its top police agency, set aside billions of dollars under two government plans, called Skynet and Sharp Eyes, to computerize surveillance, policing and intelligence collection.In a statement, a SenseTime spokeswoman said she checked with “relevant teams,” who were not aware its technology was being used to profile. Megvii said in a statement it was focused on “commercial not political solutions,” adding, “we are concerned about the well-being and safety of individual citizens, not about monitoring groups.” CloudWalk and Yitu did not respond to requests for comment. China’s Ministry of Public Security did not respond to a faxed request for comment. Selling products with names like Fire Eye, Sky Eye and Dragonfly Eye, the start-ups promise to use A.I. to analyze footage from China’s surveillance cameras. The technology is not mature — in 2017 Yitu promoted a one-in-three success rate when the police responded to its alarms at a train station — and many of China’s cameras are not powerful enough for facial recognition software to work effectively. AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTYet they help advance China’s architecture for social control. To make the algorithms work, the police have put together face-image databases for people with criminal records, mental illnesses, records of drug use, and those who petitioned the government over grievances, according to two of the people and procurement documents. A national database of criminals at large includes about 300,000 faces, while a list of people with a history of drug use in the city of Wenzhou totals 8,000 faces, they said.ImageA security camera in a rebuilt section of the Old City in Kashgar, Xinjiang.Credit...Thomas Peter/ReutersUsing a process called machine learning, engineers feed data to artificial intelligence systems to train them to recognize patterns or traits. In the case of the profiling, they would provide thousands of labeled images of both Uighurs and non-Uighurs. That would help generate a function to distinguish the ethnic group. The A.I. companies have taken money from major investors. Fidelity International and Qualcomm Ventures were a part of a consortium that invested $620 million in SenseTime. Sequoia invested in Yitu. Megvii is backed by Sinovation Ventures, the fund of the well-known Chinese tech investor Kai-Fu Lee. A Sinovation spokeswoman said the fund had recently sold a part of its stake in Megvii and relinquished its seat on the board. Fidelity declined to comment. Sequoia and Qualcomm did not respond to emailed requests for comment.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMr. Lee, a booster of Chinese A.I., has argued that China has an advantage in developing A.I. because its leaders are less fussed by “legal intricacies” or “moral consensus.” “We are not passive spectators in the story of A.I. — we are the authors of it,” Mr. Lee wrote last year. “That means the values underpinning our visions of an A.I. future could well become self-fulfilling prophecies.” He declined to comment on his fund’s investment in Megvii or its practices.Ethnic profiling within China’s tech industry isn’t a secret, the people said. It has become so common that one of the people likened it to the short-range wireless technology Bluetooth. Employees at Megvii were warned about the sensitivity of discussing ethnic targeting publicly, another person said.China has devoted major resources toward tracking Uighurs, citing ethnic violence in Xinjiang and Uighur terrorist attacks elsewhere. Beijing has thrown hundreds of thousands of Uighurs and others in Xinjiang into re-education camps. The software extends the state’s ability to label Uighurs to the rest of the country. One national database stores the faces of all Uighurs who leave Xinjiang, according to two of the people.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTGovernment procurement documents from the past two years also show demand has spread. In the city of Yongzhou in southern Hunan Province, law enforcement officials sought software to “characterize and search whether or not someone is a Uighur,” according to one document.In two counties in Guizhou Province, the police listed a need for Uighur classification. One asked for the ability to recognize Uighurs based on identification photos at better than 97 percent accuracy. In the central megacity of Chongqing and the region of Tibet, the police put out tenders for similar software. And a procurement document for Hebei Province described how the police should be notified when multiple Uighurs booked the same flight on the same day. A  study in 2018 by the authorities described a use for other types of databases. Co-written by a Shanghai police official, the paper said facial recognition systems installed near schools could screen for people included in databases of the mentally ill or crime suspects.One database generated by Yitu software and reviewed by The Times showed how the police in the city of Sanmenxia used software running on cameras to attempt to identify residents more than 500,000 times over about a month beginning in mid-February.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIncluded in the code alongside tags like “rec_gender” and “rec_sunglasses” was “rec_uygur,” which returned a 1 if the software believed it had found a Uighur. Within the half million identifications the cameras attempted to record, the software guessed it saw Uighurs 2,834 times. Images stored alongside the entry would allow the police to double check.Yitu and its rivals have ambitions to expand overseas. Such a push could easily put ethnic profiling software in the hands of other governments, said Jonathan Frankle, an A.I. researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.“I don’t think it’s overblown to treat this as an existential threat to democracy,” Mr. Frankle said. “Once a country adopts a model in this heavy authoritarian mode, it’s using data to enforce thought and rules in a much more deep-seated fashion than might have been achievable 70 years ago in the Soviet Union. To that extent, this is an urgent crisis we are slowly sleepwalking our way into.”ImageAn undercover police officer in Kashgar.Credit...Paul MozurPaul Mozur is a Shanghai-based technology reporter.

Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The ObserverThe ObserverIan McEwan This article is more than 5 years oldInterviewIan McEwan: ‘Who’s going to write the algorithm for the little white lie?’This article is more than 5 years oldTim AdamsThe writer, now 70, takes a typically probing look at the dilemma posed by artificial intelligence in his new bookSun 14 Apr 2019 05.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 15 Apr 2019 06.12 EDTShareThere is a scene toward the end of Ian McEwan’s new novel, Machines Like Me, when the narrator, Charlie, is pushing his lifelike prototype robot, Adam, in a wheelchair through a demonstration in Trafalgar Square. The demonstrators are protesting about everything under the sun – “poverty, unemployment, housing, healthcare, education, crime, race, gender, climate, opportunity”. The suggestion being presented by McEwan and his narrator, however, is that here, unnoticed in their midst, is the one thing they should be most concerned about: a man-made intelligence greater than their own.There is a Cassandra tendency in McEwan’s fiction. His domestic dramas routinely play out against a backdrop of threatened doom. Since the portent-laden meditation on war and terrorism, Saturday, in 2005, he has also turned his gimlet attention to climate change in Solar. The opening lines of that novel – “He was running out of time. Everyone was, it was the general condition…” – have sometimes sounded like his fiction’s statement of intent. The New Yorker called his work “the art of unease”.It was perhaps, I suggested to him one afternoon a couple of weeks ago, therefore only a matter of time before he got around to the looming ethical anxieties of artificial intelligence.McEwan smiled at this idea and explained that he had been enthralled by the possibility of man-made consciousness for just about as long as he could remember. He was sitting in a low armchair in the corner of the upstairs room of his compact mews house near London’s inns of court (his primary home is a 16th-century Cotswolds manor house). He is 70 years old, still limber and thin and prolific, and among the few English novelists who can make headlines with stray comments on the issues of the day. There was a time when he appeared to approach that “man of letters” role with a studied gravity; these days he seems to wear the mantle more lightly.McEwan has twitchy antennae as a writer, scanning the news for patterns. In reflecting on the themes of his new novel he mentions the recent Boeing 737 crash in Ethiopia, in which the plane’s software apparently overrode the pilot’s best efforts to keep it airborne. This is a story, he forecasts, that will become an insistent narrative in all areas of our lives. “People are not quite aware yet that when they get in a plane they are flying in a giant brain,” he says. “That brain might believe the plane is stalling – though every last passenger and the pilot can look out of the window and see the plane is not stalling. We are in the process of handing over responsibility for safety, but also for ethical decisions, to machines.”McEwan has an abiding faith that novels are the best place to examine such ethical dilemmas, though he has little time for conventional science fiction. “There could be an opening of a mental space for novelists to explore this future, not in terms of travelling at 10 times the speed of light in anti-gravity boots, but in actually looking at the human dilemmas of being close up to something that you know to be artificial but which thinks like you. If a machine seems like a human or you can’t tell the difference, then you’d jolly well better start thinking about whether it has responsibilities and rights and all the rest.”View image in fullscreenMcEwan in 1976, when First Love, Last Rites was causing a literary stir. Photograph: Tony McGrath/The ObserverThe time frame we have for conducting that thinking, McEwan says, can probably be measured in the years that it will take for us to design the batteries that allow such robots as Adam to become autonomous. “My novel is a total fantasy. I look on YouTube at the best robots. There’s a creepy looking bald guy and various poker-faced females, but what you can’t see is the cable snaking into the mains. None of it will happen until we crack the battery problem.”Before we achieve that, he says, we need to confront the challenges of encoding what it means to be fully human. The drama of his novel, a somewhat predictable love triangle in which one of the trio has an on-off switch, hinges on the question of whether we can teach machines to lie. “Who’s going to write the algorithm for the little white lie that spares the blushes of a friend?” his novel asks at one point. “Or the lie that sends the rapist to prison who’d otherwise go free?”The tale itself is the familiar McEwan mix of minutely observed psychologies and page-turning plot. The latter is “like a pair of ready-made trousers you slip into,” he says. Though his interest here is in the limits of technology, he is not shy of the oldest stories. “I thought,” he says, with sudden bluntness, “if Charlie has fallen in love with the girl upstairs and a robot comes along who they have chosen to be averagely well endowed, then we are going to be so disappointed if he doesn’t fuck her…”In this sense, you might say, he is coming at the AI question from the opposite angle to Mary Shelley in Frankenstein. “There the monster is a metaphor for science out of control, but it is ourselves out of control that I am interested in.”That latter interest is the thread that runs through all of McEwan’s fiction from those early, disturbing stories of incest and paedophilia and psychosis in First Love, Last Rites through the tragic deceptions of Atonement, which has now sold six million copies. The warring parties in McEwan’s imagination are rationality and its discontents. You feel just a little of that conflict about him in person. He is a generous and entirely measured talker, who gives a sense of having long overcome an inbuilt reserve. His work ethic – one that has produced 15 novels, half a dozen screenplays – is in tension with a commitment to a certain playfulness. Diary entries of his youth seem telling. He joined the hippy trail to Iran and Afghanistan in the early 1970s and even in 1976 he was recording how “we eat psilocybe mushrooms, canoe, swim naked in the electric-cold water, take saunas, play volleyball, drink wine and talk about Jimmy Carter and Ezra Pound.” Elsewhere, however, he recalled of such hedonism, that: “On the road I often dreamed of being back under undistracting grey skies, writing fiction. After six months I was desperate to get to work.”View image in fullscreenJames McAvoy and Keira Knightley in the film version of Atonement. The book has sold six million copies.The action of the current novel is set not in some virtual future, but in a reimagined fragment of that personal past. Charlie, a vague alter ego of the novelist and his robot companion, Adam, occupy a house in south London in the early 1980s, just as McEwan did, prior to his first marriage. The technological anomaly of Adam is explained in the novel by the fact that Alan Turing, the mastermind behind the breaking of the enigma code, had not taken his own life in 1954, but lived into his 70s to fulfil his dream to create the first human-like brain.There were other contemporary parallels with that period that drew McEwan to it. He admits that he would not know quite where to start in writing a novel about our current polarised moment (“there are too many constituencies to consider”) but this book gave him a licence to examine a decade whose political dramas seem much like our own. Thus the book makes reference to the battle for the soul of the Labour party between the Trotskyite comrades of Tony Benn and the centrist followers of Denis Healey. It also imagines the fallout of a Falklands war that had been a humiliating defeat rather than a flag-waving victory.“The great thing about having an altered reality is that you can’t get anything wrong,” McEwan says. “Though I have become a merchant of fake news, I’m afraid, for probably an entire American audience and almost anyone else under 40.”The more McEwan reimagined that era, the more he felt that its history was being replayed as farce. “When the Falklands happened I was very much against the whole enterprise, and everyone I knew – with the exception of Christopher Hitchens – felt the same,” he recalls. “Yet every poll I read said 80 or 90% were in favour of the invasion. I realised what a bubble I lived in then as now. I have so few friends or acquaintances that are in favour of Brexit.”McEwan embarked on his novel a couple of months after the European referendum. I wonder how much of the general atmosphere of malaise he felt had filtered into it?He says that if it has, it is mostly subconscious. “Sometimes, I wake in the morning wondering what is bearing in on me, and then I remember,” he says. “Brexit does seem to me a national tragedy… the great lie of the Brexiters, their magic dust, was to persuade 37% of the electorate that the EU, not the UK, was in charge of immigration, and they succeeded.”On the day we meet the news is full of familiar accusations of betrayal from the Tory right. The novelist in him wants to get inside and understand the mindset of the European Research Group, he suggests, but he hasn’t quite the heart. “I am never sure what these people love about England,” he says. “I only hear what they hate. You don’t hear them eulogising folk music or Gardeners’ Question Time or anything, do you? What do they love?”View image in fullscreenMcEwan with fellow Booker prize shortlist finalists in 2007. Photograph: Alastair Grant/APAs he explains this, I’m reminded of a couple of profiles of McEwan I have read that have described him as Britain’s “national novelist”. I’d never really thought of him in that way but it seems true to the extent that he has a sure feel for the deep roots of our neuroses. The unconsummated wedding night in On Chesil Beach for example, captured all that Larkinesque weirdness about sex that was never quite expelled from the middle classes by the promiscuous 1960s.McEwan was in some ways born to that role of national psychologist. His father, Major David McEwan, was a hard-drinking spit-and-polish NCO, and he grew up in Aldershot and on various army bases in the dregs of empire. His earliest recollections, he has said, are of “weekday idylls with my mother interrupted at weekends by the loud appearance of my father, when our tiny prefabricated bungalow would fill with his cigarette smoke”. Their marriage, in which frustration became violence, began in unspoken tragedy.McEwan’s mother had met David McEwan in 1941. Her first husband, Ernest Wort, was serving in the forces abroad and in 1942 she and David conceived a child who was put up for adoption in a small ad in the Reading Mercury that was a short story in itself: “Wanted, Home for Baby Boy, age 1 month; complete surrender.” Wort was killed in action in 1944, and McEwan’s parents subsequently married. His mother’s two children from her first marriage were unwanted by McEwan’s father. One was sent to live with his paternal grandmother, the other was enrolled at a boarding school for soldiers’ orphans. When McEwan was born, he was treated as an only child. He only discovered and met the brother who had been given up for adoption, Dave Sharp, a bricklayer, in 2002.Does such a family history furnish a keener than average desire to make sense of the world? Certainly you could read McEwan’s work in that way. Does he see his parents’ relationship as the trigger of his fiction?I think about my parents’ marriage a lot,” he says. “Discovering I had a brother I didn’t know about made me really re-examine and understand differently, especially my mother, the sadness that I think I knew hung over her, which now I begin to understand.”View image in fullscreenWith David Sharp, the brother he only discovered he had in 2002. Photograph: RexIs he aware, looking back, of confronting that history subconsciously in different ways – the books, from The Child in Time onwards, are full of relationships on the rocks and missing children?“No, I don’t think I have ever gone that near it really,” he says. “It is quite a painful thought. Just the way that a war rips up private lives, throws everything into a turmoil that is mostly unrecorded among people who don’t write things down.”The war persisted in his childhood long after it ended; great events shadowed his home life in the way that history seeps through the cracks of his novels.“In 1956, we were in Libya,” he says, by way of example. “My mother had gone home for some family reason and because of the Suez crisis all army families were considered vulnerable to attack by Arab nationalists, so we were herded into camps. Actually it was one of the most blissful 10 days of my life. School stopped. I would occasionally see my father, who was then a captain, with a revolver strapped to his side in the distance, and us kids just ran free among the machine-gun nests and the barbed wire. Very heaven it was.”I wonder what his old man made of his writing?“He was torn between pleasure that I seemed to have my face in the papers occasionally, and utter horror at the contents of the first book or two.”In this McEwan shared a background with those friends, all born in the four years after the war, who later became the headline acts of literary London alongside him. Julian Barnes’s parents also never read his books (“too much below-stairs language”), while Kingsley Amis infamously never got beyond the first few pages of any of Martin’s novels. Christopher Hitchens called his father, a naval hero in the war, simply “the commander”.In some ways the friendship that group developed in the 1970s and 80s seems to have provided the camaraderie they had missed in childhood. I wonder if he believes that they would have achieved all that they have as writers and public figures without each other’s support?View image in fullscreenWith his old friend Martin Amis. Photograph: Bruce Adams/Daily Mail“Oh yeah, I think so,” he says. “We sat around then as we do now, and if we talked about literature it was only to celebrate things we liked. Mostly we just had a lot of fun.” The other day he says, he was coming back from Clapham in an Uber. “It took exactly the same route I used to drive my crappy little car to go and see Martin in the 1970s when he was living off Queensway. My car had an open top and I remembered exactly how I used to love in summer to zoom down the tram tunnel at the far end of Waterloo bridge, with the wind in my hair – when I had a lot of hair.”In a rare short story in the New Yorker a couple of years ago, My Purple-Scented Novel, McEwan told a fable of authorial jealousy; a failing writer steals the manuscript of a successful and brilliant friend and passes it off as his own, destroying the rival’s reputation in the process. Halfway through, he noted, archly, how the idea came from a story he had read about Martin Amis drinking one evening “with another novelist, the one (memory fails me) with the Scottish name and the English attitude. I heard that the two friends entertained themselves by dreaming up all the ways one writer might ruin the life of another.”Though there was no doubt plenty of competitive energy in their real-life friendships, there was always enough success to go around to make envy just a parlour game. McEwan’s was perhaps the least flamboyant talent of that circle, but it has proved the most commercial and perhaps enduring; since the triumphs of Atonement, his novels have been turned seamlessly into films. Two opened in the last year – On Chesil Beach and The Children Act. He is currently working on adapting Sweet Tooth, his story of 1970s espionage, for Working Title.Does he still go to his desk with the same excitement as when he was starting out?“I’m a great believer in turning up still,” he says. “No forgiving yourself because you are tired. I try to get there before 10, not too early.” His office is “a nice big converted barn” if he is at the house he and his second wife, Annalena McAfee, share in Gloucestershire, or here at the kitchen table if he is in London. There are still those magical writing days, he says, when “you forget you exist and you surface an hour later and you have 400 words you were not expecting to write”. He has never learned how to summon those moments to order. “But turning up is certainly the first condition. Work until lunchtime, listen to World at One, have a sandwich. Walk the dog. We have a very active sheepdog.”Long before Fitbits and 10,000-step regimes, McEwan was an evangelist for walking as the most useful creative habit, one that has taken him from the Chilterns and the Lake District to the Himalayas and the Dolomites. His eyes light up when he talks me through the 10-mile hike he has planned for the following day on the North Downs with his regular companion Ray Dolan, director of neuroimaging at the Wellcome Trust. They both see it as a way to discover healthy neural pathways.“It is more or less the case that when I have done a big walk and it is really satisfying, something is cleared out of my mind,” he says. “Particularly if the walk has had just a little edge of danger. If Ray and I were doing day walks on mountain ridges, particularly when we were younger, almost deliberately we would stay up a little too long and have to come down mountain streams in the pitch dark, with head torches, because we had lost the path.”View image in fullscreenWith his wife, Annalena McAfee, at a literary festival in Italy. Photograph: RexEntering his eighth decade he hasn’t lost his taste for that whiff of adventure, either in his walking or his writing.“The fact is I was heartbroken when I turned 18,” he says, when I ask him how he feels about his age. “My mother said to me once when I was in my 20s: “You know I would give anything to be 45 again.” I obviously burst out laughing. Now I understand. I played a good game of squash when I was 45. I had my life all sorted out.”From the outside, squash game aside, that remains the case. “What goes?” he asks himself. “The pleasures of conversation don’t fade. The degree to which I get depressed by the news doesn’t fade. Sometimes there are pleasurable events that I don’t look forward to as intensely as I used to, but when I get there, it’s a different story. I have always taken the idea of holidays very seriously and my two grown-up sons have that too, which I love. We often holiday together, something I never did with my parents.”We talk a little more about how each generation reacts to the experience of the previous. McEwan’s charmed life suggests that it is not enough to agree with Larkin that “man hands on misery to man”.“For my parents’ generation the men especially had looked into the abyss. Afterwards they just wanted to be mowing the lawn or polishing the car,” he says. “They had no problem with ordinariness that for us growing up with peace and prosperity was hard to fathom.” One positive result, McEwan says, “was that parliament was only full of people who had served in the war, so it was usefully risk-averse.”It is, he says, a shame we don’t have a little more of that character among our politicians now. He returns to our original theme, of the risks presented by the advances of technology and the apparently reckless inadequacy of our current politics to deal with them, or much else. “We are at the beginning of artificial intelligence and assuming civilisation holds together it is going to have a massive effect on employment. Already various forms of nationalism are blaming immigrants for changes that are the result of automation…”He doesn’t see change coming, but then he knows, too, that prophets are rarely on the money: “There is that rule about imagined futures: things are never quite as bad as pessimists say and never quite as good as optimists hope.” Machines Like Me is published by Vintage (£18.99).

 Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Netflix’s prediction of your next favorite show—we’re already living with artificial intelligence, and its adoption by the business world will only increase in coming years. We’re already hearing about AI’s potentially disastrous impact on the labor market, but how will these technological tools, designed to augment or replace human cognition, affect women? 
The first-ever study to map the labor consequences of AI for women, published by the Institute for Women’s Policy Research (IWPR), is a reminder of the intractable stubbornness of gender inequality, despite, or increasingly, because of, the direction of our digital future.

Today, argues Ariane Hegewisch—IWPR’s program director for employment and earnings—“The impact of technology critically depends on how it is implemented and who is at the table when it is implemented.”
Overall, IWPR estimates that there are 10 women for every seven men who work in jobs “threatened” by technological advancement (jobs that have at least a 90 percent likelihood of going extinct). Moreover, these jobs are concentrated in relatively high-paying positions, compared to the male-dominated jobs that will decline. So as women seek upward mobility in the face of long-standing employment barriers, Hegewisch explains, “the threat that tech poses to those jobs may also mean that you eliminate some of the ladders that are now available for people to really climb into a better economic prospect.” Whether you’re an accountant competing with bookkeeping algorithms or a senior bank teller soon to be replaced by an ATM, automation could wreak havoc on women’s participation in the workforce if robust protections are not put in place.

In addition, the jobs that will survive AI disruption are disproportionately low quality, such as senior- and personal-care jobs, domestic work, and adjunct teaching jobs.
The promise of tech to improve jobs—making them healthier, more enjoyable, less physically taxing and more flexible for workers—is largely driven by politics and extant hierarchies in the workforce. Workers who lack power in general will be less resilient and adaptable when technology begins to marginalize them. Decisions on when and how to introduce new technology, Hegewisch argues, hinge on whether the disruption is used “to complement people’s jobs or to replace people.” One solution could be to retrofit traditional collective bargaining for future change: For example, union contracts for Marriott Hotel workers include rules safeguarding members from the impact of automation, requiring advanced consultation and preparation of compensatory measures when potentially disruptive technology is introduced to the workplace.

The jobs most directly, and positively, impacted by tech are, of course, in technology-based industries. But with a massive gender gap in those workforces, even as Silicon Valley expands and advances, women will likely continue to be marginalized in lower-paying or lower-ranking positions.

Paradoxically, women working in the industries making up the technological cutting edge face some of the worst employment trends. Over the past 20 years, women’s representation has declined in the three largest tech sectors: computer scientists and systems analysts, software developers, and computer support specialists. Despite Silicon Valley’s progressive cultural patina, women of color are even more underrepresented in the current tech workforce: Even amid growing cultural emphasis on female-friendly STEM education programs and diversity in tech, women are still stuck on an unlevel playing field: “for women and men working at the same level of digitalization, women face an earnings gap in returns on digital skills of 41 percent.”
Another sector that will proliferate with automation is platform-based work, like ridesharing or digital “tasking” gigs. Though currently these make up just a small fraction of the job market, they are shaping patterns of commerce and culture for the digital age. And yet they are also pushing many workers into erratic schedules and unstable jobs with virtually no labor protections. Landing a fast gig online may mean less transparency, less ability to negotiate working conditions, and no effective way to organize with peers and colleagues, leading to economic insecurity and exploitation.
And others are excluded from these platforms altogether: IWPR warns that the shifting of decent work to online platforms “puts older and immigrant workers, many of whom speak English as a second language or have less familiarity with social media, at a disadvantage.”
The key to navigating these future trends is to get ahead of and harness the automation wave: First, comprehensive training programs could allow the workforce to be more adaptable to technological changes.
Second, the tech sector itself needs to work toward greater gender and racial diversity within its own ranks, including lifting more women into their leadership ranks, to help build greater equity into hiring and promotion policies.
Third, work as a whole for women, including precarious gig work, needs to be made fairer and more sustainable—for example by instituting policies that provide “portable” benefits—attached to the worker, not the job—to provide long-term financial security in a fast-churning workforce. Moreover, labor advocates point out that these protections will benefit all precariously employed workers, whether they are on a digital platform or just working ordinary part-time, freelance, or on-call jobs.
The more global challenge is to ensure that the fruits of technological advancement are reinvested in improving women’s lives. Today’s technological resilience gap between men and women stems from existing inequality: Women have always had less time and resources to adapt to change due to greater economic insecurity and caregiving burdens at home.
But technology could also turn the crisis upside down: With scheduling flexibility to accommodate online training for upgrading skills or credentials, digital learning could enable more women with caregiving constraints to pursue fresh job opportunities. A more flexible digitized workplace could allow workers more time at home, and potentially more equal distribution of work between parents, which helps upgrade the family structure for a more gender-balanced economy. But these developments require worker empowerment, now and in the future.

Then delegations of mayors and senior leaders came back in 2012, and in 2013, and in 2014.Siebel is a businessman based in Silicon Valley. He founded business application software company Siebel Systems in 1993, sold it for $5.9 billion in 2006, and in 2011 started another company: C3IOT, which is known as C3.ai.An artificial intelligence company specializing in predictive analytics, C3.ai has helped Baltimore Gas Electric save $20 million annually by checking the health of the utility’s meters and reducing the amount of unbilled energy usage. The company’s web site also boasts testimonials from Fortune 500 giants, such as 3M and Shell. Since its founding, C3 has invested more than $500 million in a software stack that performs artificial intelligence tasks.Because of all that, the Chinese teams wanted C3.ai to help with the country’s Smart Grid project, a $250 billion program to transform how China uses and distributes electricity. Condoleezza Rice, the former secretary of state currently on C3.ai’s board of directors, told Siebel to “run, don’t walk,” he recalled.“I actually had very candid conversations with them when they were here,” he said. “I simply said, ‘I don’t understand how this could possibly work. I’m in the business of developing intellectual property, and you’re in the business of massive, state-sanctioned intellectual property theft. I mean, how are we ever going to find a business model that works for both of us?’”This could have been the end of the story. C3.ai’s founders hadn’t expected to work in the national security sector in their first years. In 2015, however, shortly after former Secretary of Defense Ash Carter established the Department of Defense’s Silicon Valley outpost known (at the time) as the Defense Innovation Unit-Experimental, Pentagon representatives contacted Siebel. Like their Chinese counterparts, they too wanted help with artificial intelligence. Ninety days later, they had him on contract.Secretary of Defense Ash Carter speaks with Defense Innovation Unit Experimental employees as he arrives at Moffett Field, Calif., to deliver remarks at  DIUx May 11, 2016. (Photo by Senior Master Sgt. Adrian Cadiz)(Released) How people view this story is often colored by their view of how the Defense Department works, a kind of Rorschach test on Pentagon acquisition.Maybe it’s evidence, perhaps unfair, that the Chinese government is at least four years ahead of the United States in how it thinks about artificial intelligence. Maybe the Pentagon is taking steps to improve how it uses artificial intelligence and is ready to fully take advantage of the expertise on the subject that now resides in Silicon Valley. Maybe this is work the nation’s largest defense contractors could already perform and haven’t been asked.Siebel has his own interpretation.To comprehend how Siebel, 66, an expert salesman and an adventurer who was once attacked by an elephant, first attracted the attention of the Pentagon requires understanding the Defense Innovation Unit.Carter founded DIUx (now, initial experiments proven successful, just DIU) in 2015 with the thinking that the technology and the innovation the Pentagon needs for future battles won’t exclusively come from the defense industrial base around Washington, D.C. Instead, the Defense Department needed to attract new businesses, specifically those tech and IT companies in California, to bid on its work.Today, DIU’s headquarters are housed in a two-story brick Army building that sits in the shadows of NASA’s Ames Research Center and its giant wind tunnels. On the inside, the meeting rooms carry Star Wars references.Since its founding, occasionally lawmakers in Washington have questioned the success of DIU as a host of other organizations focused on future technologies have popped up. DIU received $30 million in 2016 and $10 million in 2017. The White House’s budget request for fiscal 2020 asks for the organization to receive about $30 million for each of the next five budget cycles.But sources in the Silicon Valley tech community said shortly after DIU’s arrival that the Pentagon staff was a walking example of what’s described as “tech tourism.”That pejorative refers to the regular occurrence of officials, usually from the East Coast, wandering the offices of upstart IT companies with open office plans and casual dress codes to talk about what it could mean for their agencies or businesses, but without investing or signing on to become a customer.More recently, the organization has won over skeptics with a series of low-cost, high-profile contracts. In the cyber realm, the team has set up contracts with security firms, including one with Recorded Future, to learn more about cyber intrusions.Previously, federal agencies only had access to a small percentage of threat intelligence, but by purchasing information DIU was able to better understand open-source data associated with threat actors and shrink research times. The contract was only a few million of the Pentagon’s $700 billion budget but was also used to incentivize other organizations to buy the information as well.In the software arena, leaders at DIU helped open Kessel Run, an Air Force laboratory that has reimagined software development.And one of its biggest successes, the example often cited by leaders in case studies and congressional hearings, has been with predictive maintenance and artificial intelligence.U.S. Air Force Senior Airman Gilbert, 380th Expeditionary Aircraft Maintenance Squadron E-3 AWACS Sentry crew chief, inspects a tire of a KC-10 during a pre-flight inspection at Al Dhafra Air Base, United Arab Emirates, Dec. 20, 2018. The crew chief’s extensive list of responsibilities including for pre-, post- and thru-flight checks, and well as various inspections, allows them to fully understand their vital role, making them jacks-of-all-trades when it comes to repairing the aircraft. (U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Mya M. Crosby) Predictive maintenance is far from the science fiction future of robot overlords or Terminator vs. Iron Man debates popular in national security circles. The idea calls for essentially identifying system failure before it happens in order to repair before things breaks.Analysts at Global Market Insights guess the predictive maintenance and machine inspection segment in AI in the manufacturing market (not the defense market) is projected to grow by 44 percent annually between today and 2025.Now consider that the average aircraft in the Air Force is about 28 years old and on any given day about 30 percent of the aircraft cannot deploy. The service wants to shrink those numbers.C3.ai’s first project with the Air Force looked at the E-3 Sentry, an aircraft that provides the service surveillance, command and control. The Air Force has roughly 40 of those aircraft, which were first designed in 1958. But C3.ai had no telemetry data to help predict when something would go wrong.“All we have is basically unstructured data in textual form,” Siebel said. “These consist of maintenance logs, which tend to be pretty messy and undecipherable. They also had flight logs, pilot logs and records from the maintenance system that might include oil inspections.”C3.ai ran all that information through a natural language processing program, took the text and extracted bits of information and stored it on Amazon Web Services’ GovCloud. The challenge was that not every piece of information is valuable.“Temperature doesn’t mean much, but high temperature might be meaningful. Pressure doesn’t mean much, but low pressure does. So, we were able to find those signals that correlated with system failure,” he said. “We built the algorithms, designed the user interface, built the application, loaded all the data and trained the users. And brought the application live in six months.”Siebel is proud of the timeline.“No chance [the Air Force gets] its [request for proposals] out in six months. Zero chance … This is a testament to DIU; I mean it wasn’t a big battle, it was a couple million bucks, right? [For] a fraction of the cost it takes to draft and evaluate RFPs, we delivered a production system,” he said.“The last time the United States Air Force had a system in production out in six months would be World War II, right?”Also, it worked. Within six months, C3.ai had demonstrated a reduction of as much as 28 percent of unscheduled maintenance events for the E-3, according to a DIU fact sheet.Then the Pentagon awarded a similar contract for the C-5 Galaxy. Again, it worked. Siebel’s team completed the project in six months. Then awards for the F-15, F-16, F-18 and F-35 joint strike fighter.The work attracted attention in the Pentagon, including from Gen. Paul Selva, vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and the Pentagon’s No. 2 uniformed officer, as well as Heather Wilson, the secretary of the Air Force.In March, Michael Brown, the managing partner at DIU, told Congress that his organization is working with the Pentagon’s Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to scale this type of predictive maintenance approach across multiple aircraft, as well as ground vehicles beginning with the Army’s Bradley Fighting Vehicle.“This is one of DIU’s highest priorities for FY19 given its enormous potential for impact on readiness and reducing costs,” he said.Now Siebel and C3.ai are doubling down.While a few high-profile companies faced protests over working with the Defense Department, Seibel and C3.ai quietly suggested one of the Pentagon’s most ambitious artificial intelligence programs to date.In late 2018, C3.ai made an unsolicited proposal to bring the entire Air Force fleet on to the system. Siebel said Wilson’s staff estimates it could lead to a 40 percent increase in aircraft availability. (C4ISRNET could not confirm that figure.) DIU’s estimates say the department could save $15 billion annually if the program was scaled to DoD’s aircraft fleet.“Forty percent!” Siebel said during an interview in his office in Redwood City, California. “Oh my God, if you’re secretary of defense, and you have 40 percent more stuff than the day before, and what’s a new F-35 cost? $100 million?”(It costs about $89 million.)But here’s another way of thinking about it: $15 billion is at least four times the Pentagon’s spending on AI programs alone for fiscal 2020. It’s about 1.5 times what the Pentagon spends on netcentric warfare and the same as the entire Pentagon portfolio in space.National security experts suggest that the program could have wider implications.Kara Frederick, an associate fellow for the technology and national security program at the Center for a New American Security, said the real value in C3.ai’s work with the Air Force may be cultural.“This collaboration, this idea of consistent data standards, the idea that you take the algorithm and upload it to the cloud and then it can be used to cross different components of DoD. It’s that muscle memory that you’re creating with this initiative that could be a bigger deal,” she said.“This can help create that environment conducive to the behaviors that you’re seeking to encourage for more efficient data processing, efficient use of these functions. … Instead of coming into varied bespoke systems, if you think about plug-and-play architecture, this is starting the ball rolling with some of those behaviors that are going to be used for a long time to come.”In addition, if C3.ai secures a contract for the Air Force’s entire fleet, it would likely mark one of the Pentagon’s largest AI contracts to date. If such a contract reached tens of millions of dollars it could help entice other tech companies, including those in Silicon Valley, to reconsider doing business with the Pentagon, Frederick said.“A couple million dollars? That’s nothing. … I think a big number will raise some eyebrows in a good way and cause companies to say now the economic risk maybe worth it,” she said. “Frankly, the smaller, single-digit million dollars contracts are not going to make it worth it to some of these companies just for the privilege of working with the Department of Defense.”Pat Kumashiro, a retired Air Force colonel who led the maintenance division for the service’s logistics, engineering and force protection directorate and is currently director of the Air Force market at not-for-profit consulting firm LMI, said companies must demonstrate deep functional expertise in the area. For example, are there maintenance chiefs on staff who understand the inspection logs?“Clearly the pressures will be to go faster and improve scale. It’s hard to slow down this fast-moving train,” he said. “What all of us want as taxpayers want is that they are not going to take unacceptable risks.”The day I spoke with Siebel in February was the day after the Trump White House announced the nation’s AI strategy and on the day the Department of Defense released its own long-awaited strategy on the topic. “Implementing predictive maintenance and supply” is one of four examples the Pentagon uses to discuss AI.“We will use AI to predict the failure of critical parts, automate diagnostics, and plan maintenance based on data and equipment condition. Similar technology will be used to guide provisioning of spare parts and optimize inventory levels. These advances will ensure appropriate inventory levels, assist in troubleshooting, and enable more rapidly deployable and adaptable forces at reduced cost,” it reads.The Pentagon strategy also formally notes the work with C3.ai.Yet, Siebel sees predictive maintenance as a bridge to broader artificial intelligence applications. Most media attention in artificial intelligence has focused on science fiction’s idea of killer robots. And perhaps rightfully so. During the tenure of former Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, the Pentagon chief put a premium on “increasing lethality” for every budget item. Siebel suggests AI systems can lock onto a target 1,000 times faster than a human.“You get into cyberwarfare? That’s entirely an AI problem,” he said. “We get into space command, these are AI problems. Now, will robotics play a factor? Absolutely. What do you want to send across a minefield? Do you want to send an infantryman? I mean, I don’t think so. Who do you want to send into some cave in Afghanistan? Why would you want to send a human being when you could send a machine? I would say that these UAVs, these are robots, basically, right? Some are remotely controlled, but why put people, human beings, in jeopardy when you can just have a machine blow up? And so, you lose a little bit of metal and maybe it costs you, who cares how much it costs. It’s just metal.”Finding targets is a touchy topic.When they talk about AI, national security leaders have spent much of their time talking about Project Maven, an Air Force program that worked with Google to use artificial intelligence and machine learning to identify objects in drone imagery. The project inadvertently became the posterchild for the Pentagon’s efforts on AI in Silicon Valley.While the program received mainstream attention, in large part because Google contractors backed out of the project, folks in the national security community have stressed it was a pathfinder.(Siebel says Maven was “a silly little trivial prototype. There was nothing to it. It was a silly project.”)As for his own systems, he says he will always build a system where humans are in the loop to make decisions, not robots or computers.“I’ve never encountered anybody in the Pentagon or in any places where we play, whether it’s [the Defense Security System, the Defense Information Systems Agency] that wants to have any discussion about an application where there isn’t a human in the loop. All we do is use AI to inform a human being. With the same data that they would have otherwise. It’s a MiG and we have it in our crosshairs.”And in the next breath, he says, he recognizes not everyone will do it that way.So now back to that Rorschach test. Is the Air Force’s predictive maintenance work playing catchup or is it an act of innovation in which service leaders are planting seeds for future bloom? Are Pentagon leaders forgetting the industrial base of defense companies in the Washington area?Siebel’s interpretation is more ominous: It’s a war to win artificial intelligence.“The way this war is being played out is that you have this highly controlled five-year-plan totalitarian state in China that is controlling it top-down and making massive, massive investments. And these guys are smart as hell. They are highly motivated, and they throw a hundred teams of people at a time at this,” he said.“And then you have this kind of very American idea … Rather than fix this through [requests for proposal] that we run through Lockheed Martin, and let these guys line up at the trough for these multibillion-dollar multiyear projects, can we get a thousand points of light of innovation going on everywhere and make little experiments and find the ones that work and latch onto them? Which is kind of a very, Western, American idea versus this totalitarian idea. It’ll be interesting to see who wins.”Air Force officials declined to speak on C3.ai’s unsolicited proposal, but Siebel said the service is taking it seriously. This winter, he sat down with Wilson and Will Roper, the service’s top acquisition official, at the Pentagon. He’s also met with Ryan McCarthy, the Army’s undersecretary. It is unclear how or even if the Air Force is pursuing the idea further.Still, Siebel looks at the aircraft’s handwritten data logs and sees not just unstructured data, but a smarter way.“I know who I’m betting on.”About  Mike GrussMike Gruss served as the editor-in-chief of Sightline Media Group's stable of news outlets, which includes Army Times, Air Force Times, C4ISRNET, Defense News, Federal Times, Marine Corps, Military Times and Navy Times.Share:More In IT and NetworksSouth Korea to deploy laser weapons to intercept North Korean dronesThe Defense Acquisition Program Administration said it will deploy at least one anti-air laser weapons system — called “Block-I” — this year.US to send Tomahawks, hypersonics, other long-range fires to GermanyThe move is in-line with the Army's plan to provide such capability to its Multidomain Task Force there.Beavers takes reins from Sherman as acting DOD information officerAs the most senior IT advisor to the secretary of defense, Beavers is taking over from former CIO John Sherman.Quieting Discord: A new frontier in military leaks and extremismFrom secret Pentagon leaks to radicalization in the military community, Discord is continuing to grapple with keeping bad actors off the popular platform.Astronauts say Boeing space capsule can safely return them to EarthNASA test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams launched aboard Starliner capsule early last month.",,"{'type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.c4isrnet.com/it-networks/2019/04/15/could-artificial-intelligence-could-save-the-pentagon-15-billion-a-year/'}",,,,,,,,/resources/img/c4isrnet-logo-white.png,https://www.c4isrnet.com/#publisher,,,,,"['https://www.facebook.com/https://www.facebook.com/C4ISRNet', 'https://twitter.com/c4isrnet']",,,,,https://www.c4isrnet.com/it-networks/2019/04/15/could-artificial-intelligence-could-save-the-pentagon-15-billion-a-year/

While artificial intelligence is key to the future of background investigations, it will always be up to humans to make clearance decisions, an official assured.

                  Workforce
                












































The security clearance process is broken—a fact widely accepted by stakeholders in the public and private sector, legislative and executive branches of government, Democrats and Republicans. As federal leaders work on the largest process overhaul in half a century, artificial intelligence will play a key role.In February, officials unveiled plans for Trusted Workforce 2.0, a framework that would shift suitability and security determinations from a one-time investigation followed by reassessments every five to 10 years, to an ongoing process that uses technology and private sector partners and data.The first step in moving away from the old process is getting rid of all the paper, according to Terry Carpenter, the program executive officer for the National Background Investigation Service, the office overseeing the technical overhaul of the investigations process.“The days of you filling out some form—online or in paper—submitting this form; having people go through that form; analyze your responses; decide which investigator to send out there to meet with your parents, your friends, your neighbors, who may all be in different states; to write up reports and assemble a package that grows as we do the investigation and come back to somebody to adjudicate the recommendation to say, ‘should this person get a clearance or not based on policy?’ We can’t do that anymore—that’s paper,” Carpenter said Thursday during the Government Analytics Breakfast Forum hosted by Johns Hopkins University and REI Systems.Before instituting the Trusted Workforce 2.0 framework, adjudicators would have to physically travel to interview people on every topic covered by the clearance investigation. Under the new guidance, investigators have the option to use other means to speed the process.In October, Carpenter’s team rolled out a tool to digitize the front-end of the security clearance process: filling out paper forms like the SF-86.The NBIS team developed a digital form that operates similarly to modern tax preparation software. Users are guided through a set of questions and document requests that ensure the data is entered in a structured format.Another tool currently in development uses artificial intelligence to pull investigatees’ data from multiple sources, including public information, private data sources like credit reports and government data, either through interagency partners or data collected by investigators. The AI tool will gather and sort that data and present it to adjudicators in a structured, interactive format.“We have a complete list of how the algorithm got to the recommendation. We can click on any piece of data in that decision-making chain and see it. And that gets packaged up as part of the supporting evidence for why decisions were made,” Carpenter said.With digitized data sources and AI helping pull and sort the information, the investigative process can move toward a “continuous evaluation” model, in which clearance holders are regularly reassessed based on new information, rather than on an arbitrary, decade-long cycle.“We already have 1.1 million names in as part of the initiative and it just goes through the data sources on some reoccurring schedule set by the business rules and if an anomaly comes up, then we look at the anomaly and decide what to do with it,” Carpenter said. “Maybe I got a speeding ticket last night and it popped up on the data source,” he offered as a hypothetical.Carpenter said the team hopes soon to be able to pilot the system end-to-end with the lowest level suitability determinations. If that pilot succeeds, the team can add more data streams and capabilities in order to handle more sensitive assessments.

All this will be possible because the team looked at the problem as a whole, rather than just finding cool tools to apply to parts of the problem, Carpenter said.“We moved the NBIS architecture to an enterprise data broker concept and we moved the data sources to one place,” he explained. “This gave us the ability to focus on control of that data. I don’t have to own it all—it doesn’t have to sit on my servers. … But we need to know that we have the connection, we have the ability to pull it when we need it, we know what the data is—what it represents—and we know the policies and agreements—the laws—that surround the use of that data.”“We couldn’t rush to the quick answer,” he added. “We had to do some of these critical, I call them ‘hygiene steps.’”No matter what, it will be up to humans to make the final decisions about suitability and trust, Carpenter said.“No decision will be made by a machine. We will augment decision- making,” he said. “Instead of them spending weeks and months trying to find needles in a haystack, we’re using artificial intelligence and machine learning to present those needles, in a neat form with all the relevant information to how we found it for the human to make that final determination.”

TT’s future with AI





		Newsday								
	



Thursday 11 April 2019

Despite the apprehension, artificial intelligence is expected to increase efficiency and productivity while creating even more jobs than it is replacing.

While artificial intelligence (AI) may seem a long way into the future for TT, local businesses have been capitalising on the technology to remain competitive and the average consumer, though largely unaware, has multiple interactions with AI daily.
As part of the company’s strategic plan, communications solutions provider, bmobile is already technologically prepared as AI becomes more widespread.
According to Hassel Bacchus, TSTT’s chief technology officer (CTO), the company’s Network Evolution Programme has, at its core, designs that include AI operationally and those that are at a state of readiness for AI capability. “So, in many instances, it is more about utilisation and application rather than upgrade,” Bacchus noted.
Understandably, a major concern and the apprehension toward the adoption of AI is the fear of losing one’s job to a computer program or robot. A recent survey by the Pew Research Center found that while 33 per cent of Americans are enthusiastic about AI’s integration into the workplace, a whopping 72 per cent worry about a future where AI can do many of the jobs that humans currently perform.



Bacchus explained, “In the customer interface space, many of the systems are being replaced and, again, AI is at the heart of the design as it makes interaction quality and content more consistent and predictable.”
Hassel Bacchus, chief technology officer, TSTT.
It’s only natural to ask, what jobs are likely to be affected by AI? It all depends of the type of work an AI program can learn and while it is still relatively far into the future, this information can help people and economies prepare for the changes ahead.
In a 2018 study, Erik Brynjolfsson, Daniel Rock and Tom Mitchell noted, “Tasks within jobs typically show considerable variability and ‘suitability for machine learning’ while few – if any- jobs can be fully automated using machine learning.” As it turns out, automating particular elements of a job – namely routine tasks – often increases productivity and quality of output by allowing employees to focus on high level jobs that require greater attention.
The research stated that mechanical drafters, credit authorisers and brokerage clerks are among the jobs likely to be replaced by AI technology. While one may say that these jobs can be handled relatively straightforward by algorithms, the study also identified concierges and funeral directors in the line-up. However, the social element required for the latter makes the inclusion seem a bit odd. After all, concierges are responsible for more than just bookings; they are a key part of the hospitality experience, and while empathy is expected, grief counselling is an unwritten part of the service provided by funeral directors.
Another study determined that telemarketers, couriers, book keeping clerks and Computer support specialists may be among those negatively impacted by AI. On the opposite end of the spectrum, as people crave experiences, AI may make event planners even more valuable which is good news for the country that hosts the greatest show on earth.
Globally, 83 per cent of businesses say that AI is a strategic priority for their businesses, and despite the scepticism, research from Gartner revealed that AI is actually creating more jobs than it is destroying. By 2025, there will be an estimated net increase of over 2 million jobs, at all levels, as a result of artificial intelligence and machine learning.
As Bacchus puts it, ""Successful deployment of AI in any space requires complementary business processes, so it is not just about technology.” The key lies in capitalising on AI to increase productivity, increase efficiency and deliver greater value and service to customers.
