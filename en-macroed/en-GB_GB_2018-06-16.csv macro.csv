However, AI is advancing in new ways to help us. From predicting earthquakes to improving cancer diagnoses, here are AI’s latest futuristic advances—plus the one that can help your business right now.So what is Artificial Intelligence (AI), anyway?You already know the Hollywood examples, from HAL 9000 in 2001: A Space Odyssey to the Borg in Star Trek, and Skynet in the Terminator. But real-life AI isn’t quite that advanced yet (and, fortunately, not as bad-tempered either). AI falls into two basic camps: Strong AI and Weak AI. Strong AI is programming that can mimic the way the human mind works—and it doesn’t exist yet. Weak AI are systems that can behave like humans, but they don’t operate like a human brain. However, there are weak AI systems that are approaching an “in-between” level—ones that are inspired by human reasoning even if they don’t quite work the same way—and that’s where the most exciting research is happening right now.Games and gamblingWhether it’s picking the best horse or breaking records, AI is learning to beat us at our own games:Want to try picking a winning horse at the track? Start off by seeing what everyone else has to say. A “swarm” is a real-time online tool that gathers people to make a decision together. Last May the company Unanimous A.I. created a swarm for the Kentucky Derby. It predicted the exact superfecta, something none of the official Kentucky Derby experts did. The odds? A mind-boggling 540-1.[1]Remember back in 2006 when Deep Blue beat world champion Garry Kasparov at chess? Well, chess is complicated; but the ancient Chinese game Go is way more complicated. And last year AlphaGo, a division of Google’s Deep Mind, faced off with Go world champion Lee Sedol and won. The game relies heavily on intuition, so AlphaGo used learning algorithms to practice by playing against itself.ScienceCan AI help us make scientific breakthroughs on this planet—and others:NASA has developed an AI meant for space exploration that could also save firefighters’ lives. Developed in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, AUDREY (a nickname for Assistant for Understanding Data through Reasoning, Extraction, and sYnthesis), can help firefighters find their way through smoke-filled buildings by tracking their movements. The tech stems from NASA’s work towards exploring hard-to-map space terrain, such as looking for life in the icy ocean of Jupiter’s moon Europa.The ability to accurately predict earthquakes could save countless lives. It’s the goal of a new study that’s using AI to crunch massive amounts of raw data gathered from seismic events and replicate them in a lab setting. By using unaltered data, seismologists hope that the AI can pick up predictive markers that humans haven’t noticed yet. If the research is successful, they might be able to predict quakes within a decade.[2]HealthcareCould it help medical professionals save lives? Researchers are banking on AI:At the Houston Methodist Research Institute in Texas, an AI was able to review millions of mammograms at a rate 30 times faster than a person. Incredibly, it had a 99% accuracy in interpreting diagnostic information found in patient charts.[3]  And Stanford researchers are using “deep learning” AI to help spot cancerous moles and detect skin cancer in time to treat it successfully. They eventually hope to make it into an app that people can use at home.Everyone has heard of the potential accidents driverless cars can cause, but one owner used his to get himself to the hospital—and he credits his Tesla with saving his life. A man in Springfield, Missouri started feeling constrictions in his chest—so he turned on his Tesla Autopilot and directed it to take him to the nearest hospital. Turns out he had a pulmonary embolism and got medical care in time to make a full recovery.[4]BusinessEighty-five percent of customer interactions will be handled without a human by 2020.[5]  That’s why chatbots are the most important AI your company can invest in right now:Chatbots come in various forms. Many companies use them purely as a customer service tool to answer simple, common queries that don’t require nuanced interaction; if a bot gets stumped the customer is connected to a live service rep. Other industries, such as finance and travel, have developed more advanced bots that act as full-service assistants, whether it’s offering advice on how to pay off bills or booking a complete trip itinerary.If you’re developing a bot, remember to give it a little personality. (Take Bank of America’s bot, nicknamed “Erica”—a friendly name that riffs off their company’s own name.) It’s good to hire a copywriter to come up with the bot’s turns of phrase so that they sound human. Think of the process as if you were a screenwriter creating a realistic character. If your bot uses any visuals, make sure they’re consistent with your character, too. (No stock images of people wearing headsets!)So don’t fear our robot overlords… yet. Whether it’s catching a disease in its early stages or negotiating a good price on a condo, artificial intelligence could soon be making our lives much, much better.

Why We Need to Fine-Tune Our Definition of Artificial Intelligence



By Thomas Hornigold
June 20, 2018 







Sophia’s uncanny-valley face, made of Hanson Robotics’ patented Frubber, is rapidly becoming an iconic image in the field of artificial intelligence. She has been interviewed on shows like 60 Minutes, made a Saudi citizen, and even appeared before the United Nations. Every media appearance sparks comments about how artificial intelligence is going to completely transform the world. This is pretty good PR for a chatbot in a robot suit.
But it’s also riding the hype around artificial intelligence, and more importantly, people’s uncertainty around what constitutes artificial intelligence, what can feasibly be done with it, and how close various milestones may be.
There are various definitions of artificial intelligence.
For example, there’s the cultural idea (from films like Ex Machina, for example) of a machine that has human-level artificial general intelligence. But human-level intelligence or performance is also seen as an important benchmark for those that develop software that aims to mimic narrow aspects of human intelligence, for example, medical diagnostics.
The latter software might be referred to as narrow AI, or weak AI. Weak it may be, but it can still disrupt society and the world of work substantially.
Then there’s the philosophical idea, championed by Ray Kurzweil, Nick Bostrom, and others, of a recursively-improving superintelligent AI that eventually compares to human intelligence in the same way as we outrank bacteria. Such a scenario would clearly change the world in ways that are difficult to imagine and harder to quantify; weighty tomes are devoted to studying how to navigate the perils, pitfalls, and possibilities of this future. The ones by Bostrom and Max Tegmark epitomize this type of thinking.
This, more often than not, is the scenario that Stephen Hawking and various Silicon Valley luminaries have warned about when they view AI as an existential risk.
Those working on superintelligence as a hypothetical future may lament for humanity when people take Sophia seriously. Yet without hype surrounding the achievements of narrow AI in industry, and the immense advances in computational power and algorithmic complexity driven by these achievements, they may not get funding to research AI safety.
Some of those who work on algorithms at the front line find the whole superintelligence debate premature, casting fear and uncertainty over work that has the potential to benefit humanity. Others even call it a dangerous distraction from the very real problems that narrow AI and automation will pose, although few actually work in the field. But even as they attempt to draw this distinction, surely some of their VC funding and share price relies on the idea that if superintelligent AI is possible, and as world-changing as everyone believes it will be, Google might get there first. These dreams may drive people to join them.
Yet the ambiguity is stark. Someone working on, say, MIT Intelligence Quest or Google Brain might be attempting to reach AGI by studying human psychology and learning or animal neuroscience, perhaps attempting to simulate the simple brain of a nematode worm. Another researcher, who we might consider to be “narrow” in focus, trains a neural network to diagnose cancer with higher accuracy than any human.
Where should something like Sophia, a chatbot that flatters to deceive as a general intelligence, sit? Its creator says: “As a hard-core transhumanist I see these as somewhat peripheral transitional questions, which will seem interesting only during a relatively short period of time before AGIs become massively superhuman in intelligence and capability. I am more interested in the use of Sophia as a platform for general intelligence R&D.” This illustrates a further source of confusion: people working in the field disagree about the end goal of their work, how close an AGI might be, and even what artificial intelligence is.
Stanford’s Jerry Kaplan is one of those who lays some of the blame at the feet of AI researchers themselves. “Public discourse about AI has become untethered from reality in part because the field doesn’t have a coherent theory. Without such a theory, people can’t gauge progress in the field, and characterizing advances becomes anyone’s guess.” He would prefer a less mysticism-loaded term like “anthropic computing.” Defining intelligence is difficult enough, but efforts like Stanford’s AI index go some way towards establishing a framework for tracking progress in different fields.
The ambiguity and confusion surrounding AI is part of a broader trend. A combination of marketing hype and the truly impressive pace of technology can cause us to overestimate our own technological capabilities or achievements. In artificial intelligence, which requires highly valued expertise and expensive hardware, the future remains unevenly distributed. For all the hype over renewables in the last 30 years, fossil fuels have declined from providing 88 percent of our energy to 85 percent.
We can underestimate the vulnerabilities. How many people have seen videos of Sophia or Atlas or heard hype about AlphaGo? Okay, now how many know that some neural networks can be fooled by adversarial examples that could be printed out as stickers? Overestimating what technology can do can leave you dangerously dependent on it, or blind to the risks you’re running.
At the same time, there is a very real risk that technological capacities and impacts are underestimated, or missed entirely. Take the recent controversy over social media engineering in the US election: no one can agree over the impact that automated “bots” have had. Refer to these algorithms as “artificial intelligence,” and people will think you’re a conspiracy theorist. Yet they can still have a societal impact.
Those who work on superintelligence argue that development could accelerate rapidly, that we could be in the knee of an exponential curve. Given that the problem they seek to solve (“What should an artificial superintelligence optimize?”) is dangerously close to “What should the mind of God look like?”, they might need all the time they can get.
We urgently need to move away from an artificial dichotomy between techno-hype and techno-fear; oscillating from one to the other is no way to ensure safe advances in technology. We need to communicate with those at the forefront of AI research in an honest, nuanced way and listen to their opinions and arguments, preferably without using a picture of the Terminator in the article.
Those who work with AI and robotics should ensure they don’t mislead the public. We need to ensure that policymakers have the best information possible. Luckily, groups like OpenAI are helping with this.
Algorithms are already reshaping our society; regardless of where you think artificial intelligence is going, a confused response to its promises and perils is no good thing.

The AI Effect on Corporate Economists
⬑ Better business decisions and reimagined roles

Illustration by Thomas HedgerWhen Andrew Chamberlain was hired as the chief economist at the jobs website Glassdoor four years ago, the expectation was that he’d produce reports on the labor market using data from sources such as the U.S. Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as he’d done previously as an academic at the University of California, San Diego.

But in a short period of time, his role at the company—and both the labor market insights he gleans from data and how he does so—has been completely transformed, thanks to the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) tools and techniques.

“Now my job is a combination of data scientist and research economist,” Chamberlain said. “I suddenly had to learn to program, to write Python and SQL code to get data from our databases, and teach myself to think differently about really big, really messy data sets.”

During the past few years, AI has enabled economists to build models using data sets that are more disparate, diverse, and exponentially larger than ever before, vastly increasing their predictive power. As recently as four years ago, Chamberlain said, he published a paper built on 400 survey results—but today, he never uses less than 100,000 and sometimes incorporates as many as a million.

As a result, chief economists at many technology companies and financial services firms have seen their roles reimagined, with new data science skills transforming them into chief analytics officers. The shift has been rewarding not only for economists but also for the companies they work for, leading to increased revenues and better products and services.

“We can make use of tools and capabilities that never existed in the past,” said Martin Fleming, IBM’s chief economist and chief analytics officer—the latter title was added a few years ago. A decade ago, he said, an economist trying to predict retail trends at a specific location would have analyzed data from weather forecasts, the global economic outlook, and socioeconomic statistics from the local census. The resulting predictions would be a “very unsatisfying” 30 to 40 percent accurate.
“We’re using information that was sitting in our database for years; it just took a bit of a push from economists to argue that we should open it up and connect it with the conversation about the labor market.”Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at Glassdoor

But now economists can analyze huge quantities of unstructured data scraped from the web—taking into account minute details like recent tweets and the fact that a hit movie is playing across the street from a retail location—to yield predictions with up to 90 percent accuracy.

Figuring out how to clean and model that data isn’t easy. “This information doesn’t exist in one site—you have to bring it together and create tools to understand it,” Fleming said. “And the complexity is further increased by the large volumes of data that are involved.”

Using constantly improving natural-language processing tools, analysts can convert unstructured data to structured data that can be fed into models created by economists like Fleming. Wesley Phoa, a fixed-income portfolio manager at Capital Group, an asset management firm, said that his company has used machine learning to analyze meeting minutes from the Federal Reserve.

In the past, Phoa and his team would simply read the minutes—they still do—but now they also assign three quantitative scores to each topic covered in a meeting (amount of attention paid to the topic, level of sentiment, and level of uncertainty)—such as banking, inflation, nonfinancial services, and so on—and use that data to compare Federal Reserve meeting minutes going back months and years, providing context and insights.

“You always get a qualitative impression from reading, but it’s helpful to have this quantitative measure as well,” Phoa said. “You get a better understanding of whether they will be inclined to react to something and what’s going to drive the Fed’s decision-making more: incoming information about inflation or wages? Then we can correlate that with information we’re getting from the companies we cover.”

This leap would not have been possible without cloud computing, which provides economists with access to huge quantities of data. “It’s not only the natural-language processing tools but the computing infrastructure in the cloud environment that has made this shift possible,” Fleming said.

The potential for productive innovation is great. At Glassdoor, Chamberlain launched monthly regional pay estimates for 10 metro regions. Called Local Pay Reports, they are generated from a machine-learning model paired with data—such as salary information—that users provide to Glassdoor anonymously. This year he plans to tie that data to job availability so that someone using the site would, for example, be able to get a comprehensive picture of the open jobs and their accompanying salary range across different industries in Seattle.
“Today, because economists are becoming more like data scientists, they are on staff at nearly every technology company.”Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at Glassdoor

“We’re using information that was sitting in our database for years; it just took a bit of a push from economists to argue that we should open it up and connect it with the conversation about the labor market,” Chamberlain said. “Now we see what it can tell us about the job market—things that you don’t get from the Bureau of Labor Statistics or the Census.”

Of course, such tools require a talented data scientist who can make sure they’re producing the right conclusions.

“One of the challenges with machine learning is that training can be very fiddly,” Phoa said. “You can come up with lots of spurious relationships.” A general lesson he’s learned is that “it’s hard to find algorithms that are, by themselves, good at predicting things. But if you expand it to, ‘What are good ways of getting insights from the data?,’ there’s a lot more you can do with machine learning.”

The changes are beneficial not only for clients and businesses but also for economists, who are encouraged to constantly reinvest in and improve their skills. As Chamberlain pointed out, AI has vastly expanded economists’ career opportunities.

“Previously, the only places that would hire economists would be banks or consulting companies,” he said. “Today, because economists are becoming more like data scientists, they are on staff at nearly every technology company.”

If anything, Phoa said, AI has made traditional economics training even more important. AI doesn’t overshadow the skills economists learned in school; instead, it augments them.

“There are now much more sophisticated ways to identify and tease out relationships in the data, but you still need the subject-matter foundation,” Phoa said. “It’s important to have folks with a strong economic background making the judgments, asking, ‘When does it make sense?’ ‘What pathways should I follow?’”

As Fleming noted, the transformation has been rapid—and fascinating. “I now find myself spending a great deal of time thinking about the future of work and all its implications,” he said. “It’s more challenging—and more rewarding.”

A. Sue Weisler
 Dhireesha Kudithipudi works with former doctoral student Cory Merkel ’15 (microsystems engineering) in her lab.  


Dhireesha Kudithipudi and Christopher Kanan are professors with different kinds of students. Their classrooms are labs, and the students are high-tech computers they are “teaching to think.”
Kudithipudi, a professor of computer engineering, and Kanan, an assistant professor of imaging science, are part of a growing group of  RIT researchers working in a field broadly known as artificial intelligence, or AI. It’s essentially about building increasingly complex algorithms—the rules that govern their operating systems—so that the machines can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, including making decisions.
Both professors and their colleagues in RIT’s Center for Human-Aware Intelligence believe their research, with multimillions in funding from the National Science Foundation, National Security Administration, Air Force Research Labs and other prominent organizations, could lead to breakthroughs in everything from health care to energy management to cybersecurity.
“There is an exuberance in this field,” said Kudithipudi. “And the work and research we are doing today is to improve human lives tomorrow.”
A new center for AI research
AI at RIT got its start a year ago when more than 200 faculty, students and staff participated in the Move 78 Retreat—a combination conference and strategy meeting. The retreat brought together for the first time individuals teaching and researching AI in classrooms and labs across campus. Move 78 leaders asked the group to focus on three areas:
How RIT will further distinguish itself in new AI discoveries;
A plan to prepare students for the future where some of the skills learned today may be done by a machine tomorrow; and
What RIT will do to augment technology on campus to better fulfill its mission.
The Move78 initiative flourished. Faculty from engineering, computing, business, science and liberal arts developed the Center for Human-Aware Artificial Intelligence to consolidate resources and foster a culture of AI research among faculty and students. There are now more than 40 separate AI-focused courses and numerous faculty-researchers in different tracts: Deep Learning for Vision, Machine Intelligence, Brain-inspired Computing and Big Data Analytics. Work being done at the center builds on national priorities for AI where the economic impact is projected to increase global GDP by nearly $16 trillion by 2030, according to a 2017 report by PricewaterhouseCoopers.
“It will come as no surprise to those familiar with RIT that we already have quite a robust portfolio regarding AI research and development. Our AI activities have been growing quite rapidly, and that is a trend I am sure will continue for the foreseeable future,” said Ryne Raffaelle, RIT’s vice president of research who helped to establish the new center. “AI is somewhat a natural for us as it brings together a number of our well-established strengths in computing and cyber technology, with things like visual perception, speech recognition, language translation, and decision-making and automation.”   
The center has four focus areas: Brain-Inspired Computing (Kudithipudi’s specialty), Machine Learning and Perception (Kanan’s area of expertise), Automation and Human-Centered AI. Projects will address society’s challenges in the areas of manufacturing, cybersecurity, sustainable systems and energy development, and improved medical care and technology.
 “There is a huge opportunity for researchers in this domain – but the tricky part is that researchers working in this area need to be truly interdisciplinary,” said Kudithipudi, director of the center. Kanan, who teaches in RIT’s Chester F. Carlson Center for Imaging Science, will serve as associate director.
That interdisciplinary work is happening:
Ray Ptucha and Andreas Savakis, assistant professor and professor, respectively, from the computer engineering department in the Kate Gleason College of Engineering, are training computer network systems to recognize images and information toward improving autonomous vehicle technology, and are advancing high tech sensors and imaging technology used in drones, medical devices, security and “smart” facilities, respectively.
Cecilia Ovesdotter Alm, associate professor and computational linguist in RIT’s College of Liberal Arts, is leading the Language Science @RIT initiative. One key area is its spoken language processing which can be used for applications such as speech recognition and speech synthesis. She and Reynold Bailey, associate professor of computer science in the B. Thomas Golisano College of Computing and Information Sciences, are working together on an NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates program grant in computational sensing.
A variety of applications of artificial intelligence topics are investigated by professors across the Golisano College, including Reynold Bailey, Matt Huenerfauth, Richard Zanibbi, and Linwei Wang. In collaboration with researchers from RIT’s National Technical Institute for the Deaf, Huenerfauth’s lab is also investigating how automatic speech recognition technology could be used to produce captions automatically for one-on-one or small-group meetings between deaf and hearing participants.
Ferat Sahin and Eli Saber, both professors of electrical engineering, are developing real-time street and traffic sign detection using deep learning, and vehicle detection using LiDAR and RGB imagery, the latter refers to colors used for computer displays. Sahin and his Ph.D. students are working on better human-robot collaboration approaches for industrial robots through intelligent sensing, machine learning techniques and visual feedback.
“There is so much happening that even as a professor it has been insanely hard to keep up. I see this becoming much more interdisciplinary. It’s not just a computing thing anymore. New algorithms can recognize faces better than people can, and these same technologies can be applied to video gaming and robotics. This technology is really moving fast. It has led to a flood of people in the field, including students, and a huge demand in industry,” said Kanan, who is working with Kudithipudi on training neural networks to continually learn and adapt over time once new data and images are integrated.
Building a skilled AI workforce
The research at RIT is also focused on building a workforce skilled in AI.
Kudithipudi’s Neuromorphic AI Laboratory has nearly 20 undergraduate, graduate and doctoral students involved in research she is conducting through grants from DARPA, the National Science Foundation and Air Force Research Labs. Over the past decade, her teams have designed energy efficient, intelligent platforms specific to image perception, pattern recognition and predictive analysis.
“Our lab has a unique strength in this area because we not only design algorithms that are inspired by the brain, but we also build the hardware prototypes that emulate these processes inspired by the brain,” she said. “Brain-inspired computing, also referred to as neuromorphic computing, has been a very important sub-field within AI. Most of the AI algorithms today are designed with performance or accuracy as a target, but neuromorphic computing is part of a unique dimension, and we are trying to deploy these AI algorithms in the most energy efficient ways.”
Recently, Kudithpudi, whose students have gone on to receive doctoral degrees and find careers in companies such as Intel, NASA and Google, was honored with the Digital Rochester Technology Woman of the Year Award. The award was in recognition of her important research in AI and neuromorphic computing, but also for her approach to mentoring students, helping them explore and learn so that they become individuals who can make a difference.
One of those students was James Mnatzaganian, who worked in her lab in the Kate Gleason College of Engineering developing a mathematical framework for hierarchical temporal memory’s spatial pooler—essentially brain-inspired architectures for computing systems. His master’s thesis in this area received top honors at RIT and by the Northeastern Association of Graduate Schools.
“Dr. K encourages her students to think for themselves. She does not assign research topics, but instead requires that students seek out topics, within the relevant domain, to research,” said Mnatzaganian. “I joined the team with the intent of having a strict hardware focus. I left focusing not on hardware, but on algorithms with software implementations. This was a turning point for my career. I realized that I instead wanted to focus on software. She helped direct me to the field that I have since chosen to make my own.”
Today, Mnatzaganian is a senior software engineer with Carbon Black Inc., a big data cyber security firm, where he uses the data science skills he learned to improve the company’s security efficacy.
The center also wants to extend its reach beyond the university.
RIT is training technology managers, scientists and researchers about machine and deep learning during programs led by faculty-researchers from the center. Participants will participate in hands-on exercises to build AI models.
Work with national and international organizations will also expand through the center, and the possibility of new degree programs in each of the research areas is a possibility—and a necessity. With countries investing millions in developing different AI technology, it is important to keep up and surpass competitors. But to Kudithipudi, Kanan and the researchers in the center, new discoveries would be shaped not only by potential economic impact, but by taking into account ethical implications. They are asking the important questions of—what is AI being used for and what can it be used for?
“If you look at where AI stands today, we have a lot of algorithms that are very powerful in a narrow set of tasks,” said Kudithipudi. “People say, ‘If you give me a big enough computer, lots of data and a deep enough network, then you can have super intelligence at your hands.’ The reality is far from it, but there is so much potential. The benefits and future successes of AI will come from several aspects as multiple disciplines—and people—come together to develop new application domains. The success in this field has to be measured by how it can improve human lives, rather than any one, single metric.”

 The rise of the machines: Three reasons humans are irreplaceable



 







Machines are getting smarter: trading trillions of dollars in stocks around the world, driving cars, performing surgical operations (570,000 last year), managing and running entire hotels, making cocktails on cruise ships in the Caribbean… truly, we are living in the age of the machine.

Robotics
Soft robots: The superheroes of tomorrow


Microscopic like a bacterium or soft like a jellyfish, the robots of the future will no longer be stiff emotionless metal monsters. This new generation of machines, biodegradable and capable of interacting with the human body, will help us conquer planets, repair the environment, or cure illnesses.






The above is the tip of the automated iceberg; in the coming years artificial intelligence and robotics are expected to create a wave of displacement right across the job market, from truck drivers and supermarket cashiers to journalists and even CEOs. It’s estimated that 45% of the current workload humans are currently paid to do could be automated by technologies that exist right now. By 2020, 5 million jobs will be lost to artificial intelligence and robotics alone, according to the World Economic Forum. Two-thirds of those losses will land in the office and administrative sectors staffed by the global middle class.
So, are we on the brink of a mass global unemployment? A sift through the historical evidence says no: census data studies show that, over the last 140 years, technology actually created more jobs than it destroyed. During the industrial revolution, mechanization may have displaced laborers – but it also produced new opportunity in an abundance of sectors, from care and creative to technology and business services.
That was because the technology created greater productivity, freeing humans to take up new tasks. In the same way, it is expected artificial intelligence will lead to further waves of innovation, unlocking new job roles and creating resources that allow firms to hire more people into existing positions. An obvious example; we’ll always need people, like BBVA Foundation award winner Geoffrey Hinton, to develop each new machine we use.






Artificial Intelligence
Geoff Hinton: “I’m more concerned about autonomous weapons than about intelligent machines”


Geoffrey Hinton, who just received the BBVA Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Information and Communications Technologies, teaches machines to think like people. His work at University of Toronto and then Google, has been instrumental in the development of a number of applications, including automatic translation system, personal assistants like Siri, driverless systems or medical diagnosis.






Within the financial sector, it is expected AI will help with everything from product definition and customer segmentation to risk management and fraud detection, allowing organisations to make the most of big data, better anticipate change, and evolve as required. Already we’re beginning to see how these algorithms can go beyond human capability to help financial entities extract meaningful patterns from data about markets, partners, employees and customers. The idea is to supplement rather than supplant human capital – these machines are designed to work in tandem with finance professionals, improving their decision-making and helping them get more done.
While hard skills like engineering, coding and social media are all important, the workers who will never fail to remain relevant in the age of the machine are those who can master a set of abilities that are rather more intangible.

















 



Curiosity






Artificial Intelligence
Are robots a threat to jobs?


This question, which has been asked about machines since the age of industrialization and the appearance of assembly lines, was in the headlines again at the latest Davos World Economic Forum. With robot sales growing steadily over the last three years, 2015 was a record year, exceeding 2014 sales by 15%, according to the International Federation of Robotics (IFR)






Technology is evolving at breakneck speed. In less than a decade we’ve gone from playing Snake on chunky polyphonic cell phones to streaming 4k movies on iPhones millions of times more powerful than the entirety of NASA’s supercomputers at the time of the first moon landing in 1969.
This pace of change presents a challenge to workers who want to upskill for the new economy. Skills in fashion today might be worthless tomorrow. The key, then, is to always be ready to adapt your talents to each new skill. This requires a high Curiosity Quotient (CQ) – an insatiable appetite for discovery. One cannot simply ‘hop’ from a typical 20th century job into data science or machine learning, but one can learn the principles of both and understand how their talents could be applied in those fields.
For high CQ individuals, learning is the primary constant. Immune to the waves of innovation disrupting their industry, these adaptable and agile survivors love getting their heads around new ideas, ask questions often, and surround themselves with diverse and interesting people. They are not the only ones responsible for their development, however. If you want to survive in the coming employment revolution, getting the right training and education under your belt is critical. The employers of the robot age, therefore, will be hubs for talent development – rather than centers of specialized efficiency – and BBVA is already taking the lead on this front.
We want our people to work at the leading edge. That means driving a powerful learning and development strategy comprised of on-the-job learning, continuous education programmes, and radically decentralized learning and mentoring practices. In doing so, we are helping our workforce re-skill with the times – empowering them to stay one step ahead of the robots in this dynamic 21st-century job market.

In a time of drastic change it is the learners who inherit the future.” Eric Hoffer

Creativity
If the creative economy were a country, it would be the fourth largest economic power in the world, with a GDP of $4.3bn (2.5 times the planet’s military expenditure) and a population of 144 million people.






Big Data
The Orange Economy: creativity is a great business


If the economy surrounding creativity were a product, it would have the fifth greatest volume of business in the world. We will explore the potential of the goods and services related to creativity – the so-called Orange Economy.






The ‘Orange Economy,’ as it is also known, is growing rapidly: the UN report that exports of creative goods and services rose 134% between 2002 and 2011. Creativity, it turns out, is something that an algorithm still can’t do. Robots and smart software are best suited to repeatable tasks in stable, calculable environments. The Orange Economy couldn’t be more different. It is the quantum mechanics of industry, a realm where strange things happen and the only constant is unpredictability. Crucially, innovation and creativity are no longer confined to the Orange Economy. Employers in an increasing number of sectors, from banking and finance to healthcare and sports, are parachuting creative individuals into their workforces. Whether as an inspirational jolt in R&D teams or a visionary force in product design, creative-thinking is in high demand: it provides the ingenious problem-solving, knowledge-leaps and technological breakthroughs that businesses need to survive in today’s highly disruptive marketplace.
Don’t worry if that doesn’t sound like you. Everyone has the aptitude to be creative. It is actually a very simple process; the combining of ideas and principles from different fields to create something new. Take Airbnb. At its core, the business is essentially a collision of the hotel and the smartphone. The founders’ key innovation was not product, or magic; it was to be the first to apply the principle of the sharing economy to the hospitality industry. Think about your own workplace; how could you use technology to do what you already do, better? Already, you have begun thinking creatively. Today, and increasingly in the coming years, employers will be thankful you developed the aptitude to do so.
Emotional intelligence
Surrounded by so much technology, spending our days moving from screen to screen, it is easy to overlook the power of the human touch.
But the more predominant machines become, the more people will crave personal, real-world experiences and connections. In 2013, Lisa Messenger launched Collective Hub as a print magazine, going against everything that was happening in the publishing space at the time.

She did it because she believes ""everything in business comes down to humanizing things,” – Collective Hub has since grown into a global success story operating across 37 countries. ""My journey” she says, “is actually a good example of how to behave when everything is becoming robotic: bring it back to that human element. That's the way you'll really get to break through and get the point of difference and, eventually, success.""
The reality is humans will always be better than robots at being human. Robot hotels might sound cool, but the novelty wears off quick. So, developing your emotional quotient (EQ) is just as important as bolstering the quotients of the two C’s – creativity and curiosity. EQ is the power to discriminate between different feelings, to label them appropriately, and to use the emotional information you gather to guide your thinking and behavior. Ultimately, building the capability to recognize and adapt to other people’s emotions – as well as your own – will put you far ahead of any robot that could be built in the next 200 years.
At BBVA we place human relationships at the center of everything we do; during our interactions with customers, employees and society alike.

Singapore bank DBS is using artificial intelligence (AI) to screen applicants for wealth management jobs, with the aim of saving 40 man-hours a month.







The bank is currently hiring managers for its growing wealth planning business and is using a platform to automate pre-screening.
The platform, known as Jim (Jobs Intelligence Maestro), has been in pilot since April. It supports staff in reviewing CVs, collecting responses to pre-screening questions and conducting psychometric tests.
The platform gives recruiters more time to find candidates and interview them, as well as freeing up time to allow them to do more valuable work. Candidate can get real-time interaction with the recruitment platform 24 hours a day.
“Previously manual processes, such as posting screening questions, conducting psychometric assessments and tests, have now been fully automated.,” said James Loo, head of talent acquisition group at DBS. “This frees up our recruiters’ time so they can take on higher-value work.”  The system also overcomes the problem of scheduling interactions with busy candidates. “Our candidates are often busy during the day, and many of our recruiters end up working long hours to cater to their schedules,” said Loo.
The Jim platform, which was created by Singapore startup Impress.AI alongside DBS’s talent acquisition team, will learn to make better assessments of candidates as it goes on.

IPsoft used its annual user summit to allow customers to update themselves on the career of its cognitive digital agent, Amelia.



One job applicant praised the bank’s use of technology to automate parts of its recruitment process. “DBS’s recruitment process demonstrates that it is serious about investing in technology to attract new talent, and will have the tools and resources necessary to help me serve my clients better,” said job applicant Brandon Goon. “This is very impressive, and it has made me more excited to join the bank.”  DBS will now roll out the system for recruiting wealth planning managers in its main markets of Hong Kong, China, Taiwan, Indonesia and India. It will also be used for other high-volume roles, such as the bank’s management associate and graduate associate programmes, where more than 7,000 candidates can apply for 20 just roles.

June 20, 2018

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, New America and the Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence Initiative (AI Initiative), a project of MIT’s Media Lab and Harvard University’s Berkman Klein Center, formed a new partnership to strengthen international understanding of Chinese artificial intelligence policies and developments.The AI Initiative will contribute $250,000 to support the work of New America’s DigiChina project, a collaborative effort to translate, analyze, and contextualize Chinese digital policy developments.New America President and CEO Anne-Marie Slaughter said:“Understanding dramatic developments in artificial intelligence and other technologies is essential to New America's mission to renew America for the 21st century. Not all of that new technology will be created in the United States, so understanding China’s technology policy and development efforts will be critical. Yet the language barrier and unique characteristics of China’s system make it difficult for the international community to take important developments into account. Along with Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center and the MIT Media Lab, New America's DigiChina team will have an opportunity to build on its early success in broadening discussions and understanding of Chinese AI and digital policy.”DigiChina, which published its first work in July 2017, emerged organically from a group of scholars and analysts on technology in China and has so far published translations and analysis by 12 scholars from 10 different organizations. AI Initiative Executive Director Tim Hwang said:“Translation is powerful. DigiChina has been doing crucial work to open China’s AI and machine learning policy discourse to an international readership. We believe an accurate understanding of trends in China is critical for productive conversations on the international development of AI, and we are excited to be taking this forward in partnership with New America.”In 2017, DigiChina published the first complete English-language translation of China’s New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan, which lays out ambitions for AI development and policy stretching to 2030. See below for links to other work so far on AI-related issues.DigiChina Coordinating Editor Graham Webster said:“With China home to so much of the world’s development and deployment of AI technologies, global efforts to address ethics and policies surrounding AI have to reckon with what’s going on in China’s policy world. The choices Chinese regulators and companies make on AI-related policies, from personal privacy to national security, will have effects in tech and policy communities worldwide.”Links to DigiChina’s AI-focused work so far:China’s Plan to ‘Lead’ in AI: Purpose, Prospects, and Problems (including a full translation of China’s “New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan”)Translation: Chinese government outlines AI ambitions through 2020From Riding a Wave to Full Steam Ahead: As China’s Government Mobilizes for AI Leadership, Some Challenges Will Be Tougher Than OthersChinese Interests Take a Big Seat at the AI Governance Table: Government and Industry Team to Shape Emerging AI Standards-Setting ProcessTranslation: Excerpts from China’s ‘White Paper on Artificial Intelligence Standardization’About the AI Initiative:  The Ethics and Governance of AI Initiative is a hybrid research effort and philanthropic fund that seeks to ensure that technologies of automation and machine learning are researched, developed, and deployed in a way which vindicate social values of fairness, human autonomy, and justice. The Initiative is a joint project of the MIT Media Lab and the Harvard Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society. It incubates a range of research, prototyping, and advocacy activities within these two anchor institutions and across the broader ecosystem of civil society. More at https://aiethicsinitiative.org/.About DigiChina: The DigiChina project, housed in New America’s Cybersecurity Initiative, is a collaborative effort to understand China’s digital policy developments, primarily through translating and analyzing Chinese-language sources. How the Chinese state and society deploy and use digital technologies is increasingly consequential for governance, markets, and security around the world. From laws and regulations to published commentaries from policymakers and corporate strategies, China’s public sphere provides a great deal of insight into what’s happening and why. DigiChina contributors, working collaboratively with industry and policy experts around the globe, work innovatively to bring that insight to an international audience and better inform important debates and decisions. More at https://www.newamerica.org/cybersecurity-initiative/digichina/About New America: We are dedicated to renewing America by continuing the quest to realize our nation's highest ideals, honestly confronting the challenges caused by rapid technological and social change, and seizing the opportunities those changes create.

Artificial Intelligence is a hot topics among leaders in most companies these days. There seems to be a fierce race towards getting ahead of the game without many people asking why? Some of the most common arguments for using artificial intelligence is that it reduces or eliminates human errors. But have we thought about the side effects? Why are we humans so eager to make ourselves redundant? Is it really the only thing we live for - being effective? In Gugin we have seen an increasing number of requests from clients around the world, who are concerned about how their organisations are responding to the introduction of artificial intelligence in various areas. These concerns make a lot of sense to us as corporate culture consultants because there are a number of unresolved issues.



A lot of people fear that artificial intelligence will make them redundant. We know that a lot of entry-level jobs in law firms and auditing companies have already disappeared. How will it affect the company culture, when the hero is no longer a person but a computer? It might sound irrelevant, but we need heroes in all cultures - also in corporate cultures. How do we tackle situations where highly esteemed senior employees are overruled by a computer. How does artificial intelligence influence people's level of motivation? We know from some preliminary research we have conducted in Gugin Research Unit that it has a negative effect. ""Why should I work hard to become better when I - in the end will lose to a computer""? Artificial intelligence elevates the stress level in the organisation. That leads to de-motivated employees, more sick leave and lower productivity. The Artificial Intelligence area is developing very fast. We know very little about the impact it has on us humans, the groups and cultures we belong to. And there are all the ethical questions I won't touch in this article despite they take the most time when I am doing speeches on this topicDoes it really matter that we destroy the old company culture?Yes it does! A culture - any culture - has some very unique functions. It gives us a reason for being. Having something together with other people is crucial for our well-being. We trust people from the same culture more than people from other cultures. We define ourselves by the cultures we belong to. If you ask a person at an even what he or she is doing it is very likely he or she will tell you what he or she does professionally. That is because the job mean a lot to him or her. We respect the hierarchy in the cultures we are members of, because they are perceived fair in that particular cultural setting.Artificial will most likely change thatPeople who are very excited about artificial intelligence often use the word ""disruption"". But what might happen is actually destruction from which there is no way back.Reason for being, which comes from the French ""raison d'être"" is defined as ""the sole or ultimate purpose of something or someone"". If we lose that and we give up we will give all the power to the robots, augmented reality and artificial intelligence. And at that time it has become really intelligent. So intelligent that it may conclude that we, the human are no more than a liability and must be eradicated.If we don't want that to happen we have the become far more critical than we are today and don't leave the decisions with the people who only see the technological possibilities.In Gugin we already see the first signs among some of our clients that it has already gone too far too fast.

Microsoft employees posted an open letter on Tuesday protesting the software maker’s work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.Credit...Stuart Isett for The New York TimesBy Sheera FrenkelJune 19, 2018SAN FRANCISCO — In an open letter posted to Microsoft’s internal message board on Tuesday, more than 100 employees protested the software maker’s work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and asked the company to stop working with the agency, which has been separating migrant parents and their children at the border with Mexico.“We believe that Microsoft must take an ethical stand, and put children and families above profits,” said the letter, which was addressed to the chief executive, Satya Nadella. The letter pointed to a $19.4 million contract that Microsoft has with ICE for processing data and artificial intelligence capabilities.Calling the separation of families “inhumane,” the employees added: “As the people who build the technologies that Microsoft profits from, we refuse to be complicit. We are part of a growing movement, comprised of many across the industry who recognize the grave responsibility that those creating powerful technology have to ensure what they build is used for good, and not for harm.”The letter is part of a wave of tech workers mobilizing this week against the Trump administration’s new “zero tolerance” policy that refers for criminal prosecution all immigrants apprehended crossing the border without authorization. The policy has resulted in about 2,000 children being separated from their migrant parents, raising a bipartisan outcry.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAt Silicon Valley companies including Google, Apple and Facebook, employees have in recent days circulated internal emails asking for donations to nonprofit groups that support immigrants. Many have shared information about protests in San Francisco and Washington. And some of the workers have spoken to their managers about the issue or called on internal message boards for their chief executives to respond.The activity has had an effect. Late on Tuesday, after Microsoft’s employee letter went up, the company released a memo from Mr. Nadella in which he called the immigration policy “cruel and abusive” and said Microsoft was not working with the federal government on any projects to separate families. Microsoft’s president, Brad Smith, also published a blog post titled, “The Country Needs to Get Immigration Right.”Their comments came after other tech chief executives spoke up on Tuesday. Apple’s chief, Timothy D. Cook, in an interview with The Irish Times, called the immigration policy “heartbreaking.” Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX, tweeted that he was a “top donor” to the American Civil Liberties Union and said that “if there is some way for me to help these kids I will do so.” Sundar Pichai of Google, Dara Khosrowshahi of Uber and Chuck Robbins of Cisco also tweeted their opposition to the policy.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTImagePresident Trump with Microsoft’s chief executive, Satya Nadella, center, and Amazon’s chief, Jeff Bezos, last year.Credit...Nicholas Kamm/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesOn Facebook, two former employees of the social network started a fund-raiser on Saturday to collect $1,500 for migrants who needed legal assistance because of the new policy. By Tuesday afternoon, the effort had garnered more than $5 million from donors who included numerous tech workers, according to a spokeswoman for the fund-raising drive.Among the donors were Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and its chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, a Facebook spokesman said. In a Facebook post on Tuesday, Mr. Zuckerberg called for more donations and said the policy of splitting up immigrant children from their families needed to be stopped. Ms. Sandberg, in her own Facebook post, called the cries of the children taken from their parents “unbearable” and added that the practice “needs to end now.”The activity by tech workers is reminiscent of  protests in January 2017 when many Silicon Valley employees were up in arms over an executive order from President Trump that suspended immigration from seven mostly Muslim countries. At the time, Google employees held rallies to object; Amazon and Expedia were among the companies that filed in court to stop the order. (Many tech companies comprise workers who are first-generation immigrants or who grew up in immigrant families.)AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSince then, tech workers have watched their companies increasingly come under scrutiny for their moral and ethical behavior. Many tech employees have begun organizing against actions by their own companies — in April, for example, thousands of Google employees signed a letter protesting the company’s involvement in a Pentagon program that uses artificial intelligence in weaponry.VideotranscriptBackbars0:00/3:03-0:00transcriptWhere Trump’s ‘Zero Tolerance’ Immigration Policy BeganPresidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama both increased enforcement on the U.S.-Mexico border. Here is how their approaches differed from the Trump administration.This image has become a powerful representation of the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration: a 2-year old girl sobbing, as U.S. border patrol agents searched her mother. “If you cross the border unlawfully, then we will prosecute you. If you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you. And that child may be separated from you as required by law.” The Trump White House’s tactic of systematically separating migrant families is a dramatic shift. There have been cases of families being separated under the previous two administrations. But it’s always been the exception, not the rule. That said, Trump’s crackdowns are happening against the backdrop of more than a decade of stepped-up enforcement at the Southern border. In 2005, President George W. Bush launched “Operation Streamline” along the Texas border. He was responding to a spike in apprehensions there. The program called for criminally prosecuting all migrants. “We’re going to get control of our borders. We’re making this country safer for all our citizens.” The idea of zero tolerance took root under Bush, and it’s what Trump has used to model his policy after. The Bush-era program meant that migrants who were caught in certain border states were put through the criminal system, not civil immigration courts. It made exceptions for adults traveling with children, but others were ushered through mass trials aimed at deporting them quickly. It’s a practice that’s still around today. “One of the things we committed to do was end ‘catch and release’ by the end of fiscal year 2006.” Under this policy, migrants were held until their deportation hearing. And that meant an increase in beds at private detention centers. In 2014, President Barack Obama declared a crisis at the Southwest border after a surge of unaccompanied minors, mostly from Central America. “We now have an actual humanitarian crisis on the border that only underscores the need to drop the politics and fix our immigration system once and for all.” During that child migrant crisis, the Obama administration also focused on deporting people quickly and put some through criminal proceedings. But it chose to hold families together in administrative, not criminal detention. The Obama administration also set up makeshift overflow facilities. And we saw similar images back then, of adults and children behind chain-link fences draped in thermal blankets. Now, Trump is reportedly taking it a step further and considering makeshift tent cities to detain minors caught at the border. The Trump administration says it’s now merely enforcing the letter of the law. But images of children in detention have made it hard to sell it in political terms, and humanitarian ones, too.

Where Trump’s ‘Zero Tolerance’ Immigration Policy Began3:04Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama both increased enforcement on the U.S.-Mexico border. Here is how their approaches differed from the Trump administration.CreditCredit...Mike Blake/ReutersOn Monday, the A.C.L.U. also demanded that Amazon stop selling a facial recognition software tool, called Rekognition, to police and other government entities because it feared it could be used to unfairly target immigrants. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., publicly promoted its work with ICE in January in a blog post, citing it as an example of the success of its technology.At the same time, Microsoft has been positioning itself as tech’s moral leader. Mr. Nadella and Mr. Smith have publicly said they want to protect user privacy and establish ethical guidelines for new technology like artificial intelligence.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“We need to ask ourselves not only what computers can do but what computers should do,” Mr. Nadella said at Microsoft’s developer conference last month.ImageTech employees have circulated calls for protests of the immigration policy. The policy has spurred rallies, including in Los Angeles.Credit...Mario Tama/Getty ImagesSome Microsoft executives earlier objected to the Trump administration’s new immigration policy. On Sunday, Mr. Smith penned a LinkedIn post, saying the news of migrant children being taken from their families was “especially poignant.”Yet criticism of Microsoft’s work with ICE began to grow. One Microsoft engineer, Larry Osterman, tweeted on Monday to ask how working with ICE matched with the company’s “ethical stances.”Mat Marquis, an independent developer who works with Microsoft, also said in a tweet on Monday that he no longer planned to work with the company because of its ICE contract. When he receives his last payment from Microsoft, he said, he plans to donate the money to a group providing support to families that had been separated at the border.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTLate Monday, Microsoft issued a statement saying that it was not working with federal agencies to separate children from their families at the border and that it was not aware of its services or products being used for that purpose. It also said it was “dismayed” by the immigration policy and urged that it be changed.But for many Microsoft employees, that was not satisfactory. A group of about a dozen employees began working together to draft the protest letter, in which they said the company’s statement “does not go far enough.”The employees continued, “We are providing the technical undergirding in support of an agency that is actively enforcing this inhumane policy.”The letter added that Microsoft should not only cancel its contract with ICE but be open to a review of its contracts with government agencies domestically and internationally, and that it should create a policy stating it would not work with those “who violate international human rights law.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMicrosoft declined to comment on the employee letter, which was posted internally on Tuesday afternoon. Within hours, it had received more than 100 signatures.It was only later that the messages from Mr. Nadella and Mr. Smith decrying the immigration policy were released. “We will always stand for immigration policies that preserve every person’s dignity and human rights,” Mr. Nadella said.Follow Sheera Frenkel on Twitter: @sheeraf.Daisuke Wakabayashi contributed reporting.

Getting robots to do things isn’t easy: Usually, scientists have to either explicitly program them or get them to understand how humans communicate via language.
But what if we could control robots more intuitively, using just hand gestures and brainwaves?
A new system spearheaded by researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) aims to do exactly that, allowing users to instantly correct robot mistakes with nothing more than brain signals and the flick of a finger.
Building off the team’s past work focused on simple binary-choice activities, the new work expands the scope to multiple-choice tasks, opening up new possibilities for how human workers could manage teams of robots.
By monitoring brain activity, the system can detect in real-time if a person notices an error as a robot does a task. Using an interface that measures muscle activity, the person can then make hand gestures to scroll through and select the correct option for the robot to execute.

The team demonstrated the system on a task in which a robot moves a power drill to one of three possible targets on the body of a mock plane. Importantly, they showed that the system works on people it’s never seen before, meaning that organizations could deploy it in real-world settings without needing to train it on users.
“This work combining EEG and EMG feedback enables natural human-robot interactions for a broader set of applications than we've been able to do before using only EEG feedback,” says CSAIL Director Daniela Rus, who supervised the work. “By including muscle feedback, we can use gestures to command the robot spatially, with much more nuance and specificity.”
PhD candidate Joseph DelPreto was lead author on a paper about the project alongside Rus, former CSAIL postdoc Andres F. Salazar-Gomez, former CSAIL research scientist Stephanie Gil, research scholar Ramin M. Hasani, and Boston University Professor Frank H. Guenther. The paper will be presented at the Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) conference taking place in Pittsburgh next week.In most previous work, systems could generally only recognize brain signals when people trained themselves to “think” in very specific but arbitrary ways and when the system was trained on such signals. For instance, a human operator might have to look at different light displays that correspond to different robot tasks during a training session.
Not surprisingly, such approaches are difficult for people to handle reliably, especially if they work in fields like construction or navigation that already require intense concentration.
Meanwhile, Rus’ team harnessed the power of brain signals called “error-related potentials” (ErrPs), which researchers have found to naturally occur when people notice mistakes. If there’s an ErrP, the system stops so the user can correct it; if not, it carries on.
“What’s great about this approach is that there’s no need to train users to think in a prescribed way,” says DelPreto. “The machine adapts to you, and not the other way around.”
For the project the team used “Baxter,” a humanoid robot from Rethink Robotics. With human supervision, the robot went from choosing the correct target 70 percent of the time to more than 97 percent of the time.
To create the system the team harnessed the power of electroencephalography (EEG) for brain activity and electromyography (EMG) for muscle activity, putting a series of electrodes on the users’ scalp and forearm.
Both metrics have some individual shortcomings: EEG signals are not always reliably detectable, while EMG signals can sometimes be difficult to map to motions that are any more specific than “move left or right.” Merging the two, however, allows for more robust bio-sensing and makes it possible for the system to work on new users without training.
“By looking at both muscle and brain signals, we can start to pick up on a person's natural gestures along with their snap decisions about whether something is going wrong,” says DelPreto. “This helps make communicating with a robot more like communicating with another person.”
The team says that they could imagine the system one day being useful for the elderly, or workers with language disorders or limited mobility.
“We’d like to move away from a world where people have to adapt to the constraints of machines,” says Rus. “Approaches like this show that it’s very much possible to develop robotic systems that are a more natural and intuitive extension of us.”

The idea is to create an interface that acts like an extension of a person’s will, without any training or learning any mental commands. CSAIL director and project supervisor Daniella Rus says in a statement that the goal is to “move away from a world where people have to adapt to the constraints of machines . . . to develop robotic systems that are a more natural and intuitive extension of us.”

This isn’t the first time scientists have tried to control robots with brainwaves, but older systems failed when it came to accuracy. For example, past research required the person to learn and practice each new command–for example, you’d have to mentally associate a graphic pattern with a robotic command like “go to the left” or “go to the right.” It was the equivalent of asking a person to learn a new language. And even when you did, you would have to think really hard on that graphic pattern to get the robot to execute the command based on the EEG patterns generated by your brain, recorded via electrodes placed on your scalp. All that mental effort still had a low effectivity rate, with only 70% accuracy. “Such approaches are difficult for people to handle reliably, especially if they work in fields like construction or navigation that already require intense concentration,” the authors point out.The new work avoids those pitfalls by combining the EEG with something called electromyography, or EMG. It’s a technique that monitors the electrical activity of your skeletal muscles–in this case, on your arm. This hybrid method lets the person communicate with the robot both by thinking and gesturing, making it much more efficient to control. According to co-lead author Joseph DelPreto, who developed the work alongside Rus, former CSAIL postdoctoral associate Andres F. Salazar-Gomez, former CSAIL research scientist Stephanie Gil, research scholar Ramin M. Hasani, and Boston University professor Frank H. Guenther, it’s “more like communicating with another person.”[Photo: MIT CSAIL]The team demonstrated using a humanoid robot called Baxter manufactured by Boston-based Rethink Robotics. The person–the robot’s director–was connected to a computer controlling Baxter with scalp electrodes to monitor EEG activity and electrodes on their forearm to monitor EMG activity.Baxter was equipped with a power drill and given a task–to reach three drilling targets on a mock-up of a plane fuselage. Baxter, without any training, would select a target and go for it. If the person noticed that it had selected the wrong drilling location, they would simply think about it in order to stop Baxter, and then gesture, gently, to the correct hole. In the process, Baxter learns what kind of brain and muscle electrical activity correspond to that target. In other words, as DelPreto explains, it’s the robot that learns from the way the user thinks rather than the user having to learn the robot’s language.The system also monitors something called error-related potentials–a type of brain signal that occurs naturally when we detect a mistake. If such a signal occurs, Baxter stops so its human pilot can correct the mistake with a quick gesture.The difference between the success rates of the old EEG-based system and the new hybrid method was more than significant. The accuracy went from 70% to 97%, almost perfect and without training. That’s a huge success differential, and a giant step toward a future in which the user interface disappears in favor of simply thinking. The MIT team imagines that one day this type of technology could be “useful for the elderly, or workers with language disorders or limited mobility.” Also, giant manga robots.Recognize your technological breakthrough by applying to this year’s Next Big Things in Tech Awards!
