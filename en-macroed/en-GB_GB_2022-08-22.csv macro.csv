Interview: Dr Hatim Abdulhussein on artificial intelligence in healthcare


                    August 24, 2022 7:00 am                






We were joined by Dr Hatim Abdulhussein for our latest interview. Hatim is National Clinical Lead for AI and Digital Media Workforce at the Directorate of Innovation, Digital and Transformation at Health Education England (HEE), in addition to his role as a GP.
Hatim shared some of the AI projects he is working on, his views on the adoption of AI in healthcare, the role of regulation and governance, and more.
To begin, Hatim introduced his role, his area of work and his interests.
By background I’m a GP, I work in a practice in North West London.
Over the last year and a half, I’ve been leading Health Education England’s Digital AI and Robotics in Education programme. The real aim of that programme was to learn from the findings of the Topol Review in 2019, around the emerging types of technologies that would impact the workforce within the next 20 years, and to deliver some of the recommendations around education and training for these technologies. Ultimately, if we have safe, ethical adoption of technology, then we can improve patient care.
My role is to understand what technologies are emerging and think about what the workforce impact might be from those technologies. When we talk about workforce impact, it’s about understanding how the way we work will change, and how we might need to change the skills that we have as a result of working with technology.
At the same time, it’s important to reflect on the technologies that we are already using in practice. As a GP, I now use a variety of technologies in my practice, from clinical triage tools to e-consultations to telemedicine tools. So what does that mean for me – how do I need to develop my skills in order to work with these technologies as effectively as possible? There’s still a gap in education and training processes and curricula in this area, so it’s about understanding how we can plug that gap. The first step is to understand what people need to know, what their learning needs are. That’s a key part of our work. Off the back of that, you can start to deliver education and training.
I got interested in this space because I’m very passionate about improving patient care. Technology is one aspect of how we can do that. But I have clearly seen throughout my career as a doctor that although projects can be handled with the best of intentions, workforce impact or workforce preparation aren’t always considered. A lot of the time, technology gets implemented but isn’t successful because that engagement work hasn’t been done.
There are different aspects to the responsibility here. It’s the responsibility of those who are making those decisions to implement technologies, to ensure that they have a good plan for workforce education and training. It’s also the responsibility of the healthcare professionals to ensure that they are digitally literate and able to engage appropriately with changing technologies. And it’s the responsibility of our educators to make sure that the necessary learning exists in the system for people to access.
That’s what drives me within this role, to bring all of those aspects together and best support our system to do that.
The role of AI
A lot of our focus has been on the workforce impact of AI technologies, and the policy towards how we develop the education strategy around AI.
In January, HEE published something called the AI roadmap, which is a stocktake of current AI technologies in the NHS in terms of self-reported data from various datasets like the State of the Nation survey and the Innovation Pipeline. That allows us to understand what technologies are out there and what taxonomy they sit in; for example, are they diagnostic or are they focused on service efficiency? Are they driven towards remote monitoring or population health? The roadmap helps us dig deeper to understand how they will affect the different types of workforce groups. We’ve done a couple of case studies to explore this, one in lung imaging and one on mental health wards, to really develop our understanding of how the technologies in question changed the way that people worked.
The roadmap has been well received, it provides a lot of clarity on the current spread of AI technologies within the NHS. It highlights where we need to go further and it also shows where we need to think more specifically about workforce preparation.
We followed the roadmap with a report called ‘Understanding healthcare workers’ confidence in AI’. That’s a really important piece of work because it allows us to start to etch out the challenges or the barriers that we need to overcome to get to a point where our healthcare workers are confident with AI. It talks about what will drive confidence in AI at a national level, at a local level and for individuals. That’s been a really interesting piece to do with different stakeholders, to bring their expertise together and enhance the conversation in this space. We hope to follow this up with a piece around educational needs as a result.
Education for clinicians 
We need to consider that there are different aspects to our clinical workforce that will have very different needs. Not everyone needs to be a data scientist or an expert in AI or digital health, but there are baseline educational needs that everyone does need to have to be able to work in a digitally thriving, transforming environment.
At the same time, we know that there is a significant shortage in the digital, data and technology workforce. Many of our clinicians who have interest in these areas would be pivotal to driving forward digital transformation in the NHS if they moved into some of these roles alongside their clinical work. So we have to think about how we can help that aspect of the workforce develop their skills in order to work towards more specialist roles around digital and technology. We need to think about what we can put in place to prepare that specialist workforce, and also how we can drive up that future career pipeline.
The aim is to have clear educational programmes that meet the needs for those disparate groups. That includes educational materials that are available for all, to increase your baseline knowledge, and educational materials and opportunities to help drive the careers of those who want to have more specialist roles in these areas.
We’ve seen some that already in terms of the NHS Digital Academy and the Digital Health Leadership Programme that sits within it, and the Topol Fellowship Programme, which I was involved with co-founding a few years ago. These programmes provide some steps in educating clinicians to become part of that specialist workforce.
The baseline skills education has a bit more of a gap, I think. Some of that will involve working with our educational bodies and stakeholders in those areas, to embed this learning into curricula. Perhaps the learning can be included in college or in higher education, to ensure that these skills are embedded as early as possible in people’s careers, so that when they are working in practice they are ready to work effectively with technology and they understand the core concepts around digital literacy and inclusion.
The adoption of AI in healthcare
There’s a fantastic report that was published by my colleagues at The Health Foundation called ‘Switched on’, which looks at public and NHS staff attitudes towards AI. The first thing this report found is that the more familiar a person is with the concepts of AI, the more likely they are to be positive about it. It also looks at different workforce groups and generally speaking, it found that most workforce groups attitudes tended to be negative when this research was done. But again, the more familiar workforce groups – for example, doctors and dentists – tended to be slightly more positive towards AI and data-driven technologies. So that clearly shows that there is a key piece of work that needs to be done around increasing understanding to drive familiarity and ultimately drive confidence and positivity around its adoption.
I think the biggest struggle is for people to see examples of AI in practice. Unless you see it being used, it’s still a term that feels a bit ‘pie in the sky’ for many people. That is really important in terms of being sure that we communicate where it is being adopted and how, and its impact. That will help people to understand that it is very much a real concept and it is being used in practice.
In terms of where it can be used, I think it can definitely help to plug some of the challenges that we have with our healthcare workforce and processes. As a GP, there are many things in my practice that could really benefit from support from AI and data-driven technologies. There are a lot of things that could be made more efficient and productive. AI could be a way to tackle those problems, from managing patient registrations to predicting disease to triaging consultations to the right person at the right time. It could help to free up time for our healthcare workforce to spend on direct patient care.
So if we can start to show some really clear use cases and highlight the benefits in terms of supporting the workforce, particularly in areas such as clinical effectiveness or service efficiency, then I think we should start to see more positive attitudes towards AI.
Regulation and governance 
I think our regulation and governance is absolutely fit for purpose. We have quite clear regulatory bodies here in the UK that have clear responsibilities; the infrastructure is there and there’s a strong understanding amongst these regulators that regulation and governance of AI and data-driven technologies is going to be key to healthcare services in the future.
I’m pleased to say that we’ve had really positive and collaborative experiences with the likes of NICE and MHRA. The work that’s been done to set up the multi-agency advisory service is excellent, because it really becomes a port of call for people to understand the current landscape of how you go about regulating an AI or data-driven technology, and what standards it needs to meet before it can be used in practice. This is useful both for those who are developing these technologies, and those who are implementing them.
I think there’s an understanding that this is important, that it needs to be present and clear, and it is supportive for the people who are trying to drive the uptake of AI in the NHS.
Of course, it’s at an early stage, so we need to be mindful of that. The technology is at an early stage too, and we’ve got some early use cases, so I’d say let’s move forwards with that, and make sure we move everything at the right pace.
Developing confidence in AI
In our report on healthcare confidence in AI, we talk about developing confidence on three levels.
The first level, on a national scale, is having that understanding that an AI technology has the right evidence base, has been looked at from a regulatory and standards perspective, and is robust enough to be used and be effective in practice.
The second layer of confidence is at a local level. At this level, you need to know that it is has that evidence base, but crucially, can that evidence be generalised to your population? We need to be especially careful of that with AI because it’s based on data and that data must be representational of the population that you serve, so local validation is extremely important. It’s also important to make sure that you have the system, culture and processes in place to be able to effectively locally implement something – being confident of those processes within your organisation is going to be key to driving clinician confidence.
The third level of confidence is individual – understanding the impact of the technology’s use on a person or patient. It’s about understanding the impact that the technology can have on your decision-making, the types of biases that you need to be aware of, and ensuring that the information the technology provides is adequately representational. You need to be confident that you can use it to make a decision safely. It’s also about understanding where the liability lies, when you’re using a technology like AI to support your own decision-making, so that you have that protection from a liability perspective.
Finally, there’s user experience. Is it easy to use, does it work well within your existing pathways? If these factors are achieved, then you are going to feel more confident with the technology.

In 2021 alone, $93.5 billion in private investment was poured into the field, more than double the figure of 2020. Women, however, are being left behind at every step of the artificial intelligence (AI) life cycle – the technology powering the digital transformation. This gender gap in AI is self-perpetuating. And it risks us being left with an economic and technological system with a massive underrepresentation of women. Have you read?3 women in AI who are helping bridge the gender equity gapWill AI make the gender gap in the workplace harder to close?We have to fight for a fairer tech industry for womenThe gender gap in AIWomen are not as “online” as men. The pandemic accelerated mobile internet adoption; however, women are 16% less likely than men to use mobile internet across low-and middle-income countries, according to the GSMA data.Then the disparity in the number of women versus men in industry 4.0 exacerbates the lack of entry points for women into tech.Have you read?What is 'Industry 4.0' and what will it mean for developing countries?This huge inequity is a problem that has seen no improvement over the past decade, with the share of female artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science PhDs stuck at 20%.These are pressing problems alone but also lead to ripple effects across the rest of the AI life cycle, particularly in innovation and development. As recent research by the World Economic Forum demonstrates, the percentage of male graduates in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) is 400% higher than women graduates (8.2% versus 1.7%). The tech workforce continues to be dominated by men, with only a quarter of all tech jobs held by women and the majority of technical and leadership roles held by men. Specifically, women make up only 22% of AI professionals globally. Only 13.83% of AI paper authors are women, only 18% of authors at the leading AI conferences are women and just 2% of venture capital was directed towards start-ups founded by women in 2019. These numbers are an affront to key principles of diversity and inclusion. But the lack of female participation in this sector is also a detriment for the industry as a whole, which becomes more effective the more gender-diverse it is.COVID-19 threatens to exacerbate this trend further. Women in tech are twice as likely as men to have lost their jobs and 42% of women in tech say they took on most of the household work during the pandemic; therefore, the inequality women experience at work is compounded by the inequality they face at home.The lack of gender diversity in the workforce, the gender disparities in STEM education and the failure to contend with the uneven distribution of power and leadership in the AI sector are very concerning, as are gender biases in data sets and coded in AI algorithm products. These systems replicate patterns of gender bias in ways that can exacerbate the current gender divide by spreading and reinforcing harmful gender stereotypes.“The lack of gender diversity in the workforce, the gender disparities in STEM education and the failure to contend with the uneven distribution of power and leadership in the AI sector are very concerning, as are gender biases in data sets and coded in AI algorithm products.”— Gabriela I. Ramos Patiño, Assistant Director-General for the Social and Human Sciences, UNESCOAddressing systemic inequalityThe key challenge here is addressing the inequity at every stage of the life cycle. We must legislate equality and promote diversity to combat these issues effectively and efficiently. Concrete policy actions must be put in place to foster women and girls’ full participation in the digital sector while at the same time addressing the entrenched stereotypes and social norms that stubbornly lead to discrimination and even violence against women. Beyond national legislation, we need a global standard — a normative instrument to guide the development and use of AI to ensure that they work for the good of all individuals and particularly women and girls.UNESCO has taken on this challenge.At the request of its members, UNESCO developed the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, the first such global standard-setting instrument for AI, which all 193 Member States adopted in November 2021. The recommendation lays the groundwork for a digital transformation that promotes human rights, human dignity, gender equality and environmental sustainability. It achieves this through an interrelated set of values, principles and policy actions to guide AI’s ethical development and use. Critically, the recommendation pushes governments to promote gender equality, the value of “ensuring diversity and inclusiveness” and the principle of “fairness and non-discrimination,” building the ethical ground for a gender-equality imperative in the digital era. Concrete actions to tackle this problem, as included in the recommendation, include: Dedicating funds from the public budgets linked to financing gender-related schemes.Ensuring that national digital policies include a gender action plan.Addressing the issue of wage and equal opportunities gaps at the workplace, which have been a major obstacle to women’s economic empowerment for decades.Encouraging female entrepreneurship, participation and engagement in all stages of the AI life cycle.Investing in targeted programmes to increase the opportunities for girls’ and women’s participation in STEM and ICT disciplines.Eradicating gender stereotyping and ensuring that discriminatory biases are not translated into the AI systems.UNESCO is also developing two innovative tools – Readiness Assessment Methodology and Ethical Impact Assessment – to ensure AI is used to advance the rights of all individuals, including women and girls. Today we stand at a crossroads: the choice between progress and replicating the physical world’s inequalities and discrimination in the digital world. Even though digital technology will become more widely available in the market, the digital gender gap has always existed and will continue to exist unless we change the gendered social norms. We cannot wait another 132 years to close the global gender gap as indicated in the Global Gender Gap Report 2022 and It is now the time for governments and international organizations to catch up to the rapidly expanding industry, especially now with the tools provided by UNESCO to bridge the gender gap in AI.We have an ethical imperative to close this gap and to ensure AI, the future of digital technology, helps to shape a more inclusive, equal and just world.Don't miss any update on Emerging TechnologiesSign up for free and access the latest publications and insights across various topics.Sign up for freeLicense and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.Related topics:Emerging TechnologiesEquity, Diversity and InclusionShare:Global AgendaThe Agenda WeeklyA weekly update of the most important issues driving the global agendaSubscribe todayYou can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the use of computer systems and software to mimic intelligence, allowing for faster and more accurate processes. 
This field of computer science has come a long way over the past few years, with a growing number of industries now benefiting from it.
Radio broadcasting could be next, with developments in AI potentially affecting the way radio works.
Radio has faced a lot of competition over the decades, with many listeners moving to other platforms, including the recent trend of podcasts. Radio has had to innovate and keep up with trends in order to remain popular and in use. Artificial intelligence could be a way for the radio industry to continue to thrive and reach listeners all over the world.
 The use of traditional radio has diminished since the introduction of online radios, platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, Prime Music, and podcasts, particularly among young people.
Despite this, radio is still a form of mass communication that has managed to grow its audience without losing its identity while preserving its conventional route.
How Does AI Work?
AI uses processing algorithms to work through large sets of data. The AI system is capable of studying this data and identifying patterns, learning from it and evaluating its own performance as it works. The longer it has to process data, the more it can learn and, ultimately, the more accurate it can become. You can learn more about this subject and how it can be applied by taking artificial intelligence online courses.
Unlike a human worker, AI doesn’t require breaks, and it’s capable of performing a large number of tasks in a very short space of time. This means it can quickly learn and process data, making analytical tasks much easier.
The goal of AI is to build computer systems that are capable of simulating human intelligence. This way, a computer system will be able to solve more complex problems and understand a wide range of concepts to better understand the data it processes. A wide range of different technologies are used to achieve this aim, and the field is advancing each year.
Using AI in Radio Broadcasting
AI has many different applications across a range of industries and may be used in radio broadcasting too. One potential application is in choosing the kind of music and content that listeners want to hear. While a human DJ can’t be replaced, an algorithm could take over as a producer, selecting the tracks that work best.
In fact, this technology is already in use. iHeartMedia makes use of algorithms to determine what music is played and what content combinations are scheduled. Despite this, the human producer still has the final say in what is broadcast. There are various AI and machine learning solutions that aid with the creation of musical compositions, but the quality of these works is arbitrary, and the audience's preferences must still be taken into consideration when choosing what to play.
Artificial intelligence could also be used to improve signal strength, making it easier for people to listen to their favourite radio shows no matter where they are. AI is used to create an algorithm that can modify the broadcasting strength in real-time in response to various aspects of the signal entering the transmitter.
The future of radio may look very different from today, with new innovations potentially changing how radio broadcasts work. The ultimate aim is to create a better experience for listeners, allowing them to enjoy their favourite broadcasts and bringing radio to a wider audience. AI could be the answer to a lot of problems, and its use in the radio broadcasting industry shouldn’t be overlooked.

AI scientists are studying the “emergent” abilities of large language models

This article is part of our coverage of the latest in AI research.
Large language models (LLMs) have become the center of attention and hype because of their seemingly magical abilities to produce long stretches of coherent text, do things they weren’t trained on, and engage (to some extent) in topics of conversation that were thought to be off-limits for computers.
But there is still a lot to be learned about the way LLMs work and don’t work. A new study by researchers at Google, Stanford University, DeepMind, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill explores novel tasks that LLMs can accomplish as they grow larger and are trained on more data.
The study sheds light on the relation between the scale of large language models and their “emergent” abilities.

What is emergence?
This new study is focused on emergence in the sense that has long been discussed in domains such as physics, biology, and computer science. In an essay titled, “More is Different” (PDF), Nobel laureate physicist Philip Anderson discussed the idea that quantitative changes can lead to qualitatively different and unexpected phenomena.
Inspired by Anderson’s work, Jacob Steinhardt, Professor at UC Berkeley, defined emergence as “when quantitative changes in a system result in qualitative changes in behavior.”
“Since we wanted to provide a more precise definition, we defined emergent abilities as abilities that are ‘not present in smaller models but are present in larger models,’” Rishi Bommasani, PhD student at Stanford University and co-author of the paper, told TechTalks.
To identify emergent abilities in large language models, the researchers looked for phase transitions, where below a certain threshold of scale, model performance is near-random, and beyond that threshold, performance is well above random.
“This distinguishes emergent abilities from abilities that smoothly improve with scale: it is much more difficult to predict when emergent abilities will arise,” Bommasani said.
Scale can be measured in different ways, including computation (FLOPs), model size (number of parameters), or data size. In their study, the researchers focus on computation and model size, but stress that “there is not a single proxy that adequately captures all aspects of scale.”
Emergent abilities in large language models


Large language models are an especially interesting case study because they have shown very clear signs of emergence. LLMs are very large transformer neural networks, often spanning across hundreds of billions of parameters, trained on hundreds of gigabytes of text data. They can be used for a wide range of tasks, including text generation, question answering, summarization, and more.





One of the interesting features of LLMs is their capacity for few-shot and zero-shot learning, the ability to perform tasks that were not included in their training examples. Few-shot learning in LLMs drew much attention with the introduction of OpenAI’s GPT-3 in 2020, and its extent and limits have been much studied since then.


In their study, the researchers tested several popular LLM families, including LaMDA, GPT-3, Gopher, Chinchilla, and PaLM. They chose several tasks from BIG-Bench, a crowd-sourced benchmark of over 200 tasks “that are believed to be beyond the capabilities of current language models.” They also used challenges from TruthfulQA, Massive Multi-task Language Understanding (MMLU), and Word in Context (WiC), all benchmarks that are designed to test the limits of LLMs in tackling complicated language tasks.
The researchers also took extra efforts to test the LLMs on multi-step reasoning, instruction following, and multi-step computation.
“GPT-3 is iconic in having introduced the truly distinctive first wave of emergent abilities in LMs with the now well-known few-shot prompting/in-context learning,” Bommasani said. “Here, a task can be specified in natural language with a description and maybe five or so examples of the input-output structure of the task, and the largest models (i.e., the 175B model) could do fairly well on some tasks. In other words, you needed much less task-specific data and could specify the task without having to do fine-tuning/gradient-based methods.”
The findings of the study show that scale is highly correlated with the emergence of new abilities. Each of the LLM families, which come in different sizes, show random or below-random performance on the tasks below a certain size. After that, they see a sudden jump in accuracy and continue to improve as the model grows larger.

Large language models show emergent abilities at scale, where performance on a task remains at random levels until the model’s size reaches a certain threshold. After that, performance jumps and starts to improve as the model grows larger.
“An interesting example is the Word in Context (WiC) benchmark of Pilehvar and Camacho-Collados (2019). On that benchmark, GPT-3 and Chinchilla basically get random one-shot performance but PaLM, which uses about 5x as many FLOPs, finally demonstrates performance well-above chance,” Bommasani said.
The reasons for emergent behavior in LLMs
The presence of emergent abilities in large language models shows that we can’t predict the capabilities of LLMs by extrapolating the performance of smaller scale models.
“Emergent few-shot prompted tasks are also unpredictable in the sense that these tasks are not explicitly included in pre-training, and we likely do not know the full scope of few-shot prompted tasks that language models can perform. The overall implication is that further scaling will likely endow even larger language models with new emergent abilities,” the researchers write.





However, one outstanding question is whether the models are really learning the knowledge required for these emerging skills. Some studies show that when a neural network provides correct results, it is often mapping inputs to output without learning causal relations, common sense, and other knowledge underlying the learned skill.


“In general, how LMs acquire capabilities/skills is not well understood at a conceptual level,” Bommasani said. “In broad strokes, I would say there is (i) evidence that models become more robust in some ways with scale, (ii) that even our best models are not robust/stable in critical ways that I would not expect to be resolved by scale, and (iii) the relationship overall between robustness/stability/causality and scale is not well-understood.”
In their paper, the researchers also discuss some of the limits of scale, including hardware and data bottlenecks. Moreover, they observe that some abilities might not even emerge with scale, including tasks that are far out of the distribution of the model’s training dataset. They also warn that once an ability emerges, there’s no guarantee that it will continue to improve with scale.
“I do not expect all desired behavior to be emergent, but I do expect there is more we will see as we scale (especially in regimes beyond the dense autoregressive Transformers that are text-only English-only),” Bommasani said. “At a higher level, I expect we will continue to see significant surprises in the foundation models paradigm for a while; the progress from Minerva on the MATH benchmark surprising professional forecasters is one concrete recent example.”
Exploring alternatives to scale

As the machine learning community moves toward creating larger language models, there’s growing concern that research and development on LLMs will be centralized within a few organizations that have the financial and computational resources to train and run the models. There have been several efforts to democratize LLMs by releasing open-source models or reducing the costs and technical overhead of training and running them.
In their paper, the researchers discuss some of the alternatives to scale, including fine-tuning smaller models on task-specific datasets. “Once an ability is discovered, further research may make the ability available for smaller scale models,” the authors write, referring to recent research on new fine-tuning methods to improve the accuracy of small-scale LLMs.





“As we continue to train ever-larger language models, lowering the scale threshold for emergent abilities will become more important for allowing research on such abilities to [become] available to the community broadly,” the researchers write.


“The benefits of scale, whether via emergence or not, may incentivize the concentration of resources that one could project will motivate/exacerbate the centralization of power,” Bommasani said. “Historically, it is clear that AI research has benefited immensely from collaboration across academia and industry with strong traditions of open science. In light of the resource-intensive nature of scaling, I believe these must persist with several complementary paths forward: (i) norms to govern access to existing models for researchers, (ii) open collaborations (e.g. BigScience, EleutherAI, Masakhane, ML Collective) to build new models supported by structural changes that support decentralization, (iii) structural resources to provide the necessary compute and data (e.g., the National Research Cloud in the US as a National AI Research Resource).”
What is certain is that large language models will remain a mainstay of machine learning research in the foreseeable future. And as they move into real-world applications, we need to continue studying their capabilities and limits.
“Emergent abilities of LLMs have had a significant impact on NLP, concretely shifting the research in the field to better understand and develop such abilities. They also have sociologically influenced the overall nature of NLP and AI, indicating scale is an important factor in current systems,” Bommasani said. “We should build shared understanding of these abilities as well explore the unrealized potential and ultimate limits of scale.”

It’s time to start taking its potential and risks seriously.Share full article600Read in appThis image was generated by OpenAI’s app DALL-E 2 from the words “infinite joy.”By Kevin RooseAug. 24, 2022For the past few days, I’ve been playing around with DALL-E 2, an app developed by the San Francisco company OpenAI that turns text descriptions into hyper-realistic images.OpenAI invited me to test DALL-E 2 (the name is a play on Pixar’s WALL-E and the artist Salvador Dalí) during its beta period, and I quickly got obsessed. I spent hours thinking up weird, funny and abstract prompts to feed the A.I. — “a 3-D rendering of a suburban home shaped like a croissant,” “an 1850s daguerreotype portrait of Kermit the Frog,” “a charcoal sketch of two penguins drinking wine in a Parisian bistro.” Within seconds, DALL-E 2 would spit out a handful of images depicting my request — often with jaw-dropping realism.Here, for example, is one of the images DALL-E 2 produced when I typed in “black-and-white vintage photograph of a 1920s mobster taking a selfie.” And how it rendered my request for a high-quality photograph of “a sailboat knitted out of blue yarn.”Image“Black-and-white vintage photograph of a 1920s mobster taking a selfie.”Credit...Generated by OpenAI's DALL-E 2Image“A sailboat knitted out of blue yarn.”Credit...Generated by OpenAI's DALL-E 2DALL-E 2 can also go more abstract. The illustration at the top of this article, for example, is what it generated when I asked for a rendering of “infinite joy.” (I liked this one so much I’m going to have it printed and framed for my wall.)AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTWhat’s impressive about DALL-E 2 isn’t just the art it generates. It’s how it generates art. These aren’t composites made out of existing internet images — they’re wholly new creations made through a complex A.I. process known as “diffusion,” which starts with a random series of pixels and refines it repeatedly until it matches a given text description. And it’s improving quickly — DALL-E 2’s images are four times as detailed as the images generated by the original DALL-E, which was introduced only last year.DALL-E 2 got a lot of attention when it was announced this year, and rightfully so. It’s an impressive piece of technology with big implications for anyone who makes a living working with images — illustrators, graphic designers, photographers and so on. It also raises important questions about what all of this A.I.-generated art will be used for, and whether we need to worry about a surge in synthetic propaganda, hyper-realistic deepfakes or even nonconsensual pornography.But art is not the only area where artificial intelligence has been making major strides.Over the past 10 years — a period some A.I. researchers have begun referring to as a “golden decade” — there’s been a wave of progress in many areas of A.I. research, fueled by the rise of techniques like deep learning and the advent of specialized hardware for running huge, computationally intensive A.I. models.Some of that progress has been slow and steady — bigger models with more data and processing power behind them yielding slightly better results.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBut other times, it feels more like the flick of a switch — impossible acts of magic suddenly becoming possible.Just five years ago, for example, the biggest story in the A.I. world was AlphaGo, a deep learning model built by Google’s DeepMind that could beat the best humans in the world at the board game Go. Training an A.I. to win Go tournaments was a fun party trick, but it wasn’t exactly the kind of progress most people care about.But last year, DeepMind’s AlphaFold — an A.I. system descended from the Go-playing one — did something truly profound. Using a deep neural network trained to predict the three-dimensional structures of proteins from their one-dimensional amino acid sequences, it essentially solved what’s known as the “protein-folding problem,” which had vexed molecular biologists for decades.ImageDeepMind announced that its A.I. system AlphaFold had made predictions for nearly all of the 200 million proteins known to exist.Credit...DeepMindThis summer, DeepMind announced that AlphaFold had made predictions for nearly all of the 200 million proteins known to exist — producing a treasure trove of data that will help medical researchers develop new drugs and vaccines for years to come. Last year, the journal Science recognized AlphaFold’s importance, naming it the biggest scientific breakthrough of the year.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTOr look at what’s happening with A.I.-generated text.Only a few years ago, A.I. chatbots struggled even with rudimentary conversations — to say nothing of more difficult language-based tasks.But now, large language models like OpenAI’s GPT-3 are being used to write screenplays, compose marketing emails and develop video games. (I even used GPT-3 to write a book review for this paper last year — and, had I not clued in my editors beforehand, I doubt they would have suspected anything.)A.I. is writing code, too — more than a million people have signed up to use GitHub’s Copilot, a tool released last year that helps programmers work faster by automatically finishing their code snippets.Then there’s Google’s LaMDA, an A.I. model that made headlines a couple of months ago when Blake Lemoine, a senior Google engineer, was fired after claiming that it had become sentient.Google disputed Mr. Lemoine’s claims, and lots of A.I. researchers have quibbled with his conclusions. But take out the sentience part, and a weaker version of his argument — that LaMDA and other state-of-the-art language models are becoming eerily good at having humanlike text conversations — would not have raised nearly as many eyebrows.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIn fact, many experts will tell you that A.I. is getting better at lots of things these days — even in areas, such as language and reasoning, where it once seemed that humans had the upper hand.“It feels like we’re going from spring to summer,” said Jack Clark, a co-chair of Stanford University’s annual A.I. Index Report. “In spring, you have these vague suggestions of progress, and little green shoots everywhere. Now, everything’s in bloom.”

Kevin Roose and Casey Newton are the hosts of Hard Fork, a podcast that makes sense of the rapidly changing world of technology. Subscribe and listen.In the past, A.I. progress was mostly obvious only to insiders who kept up with the latest research papers and conference presentations. But recently, Mr. Clark said, even laypeople can sense the difference.“You used to look at A.I.-generated language and say, ‘Wow, it kind of wrote a sentence,’” Mr. Clark said. “And now you’re looking at stuff that’s A.I.-generated and saying, ‘This is really funny, I’m enjoying reading this,’ or ‘I had no idea this was even generated by A.I.’”ImageGoogle’s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. Big tech firms need to do a better job of explaining what they’re working on, without the P.R.Credit...Laura Morton for The New York TimesAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThere is still plenty of bad, broken A.I. out there, from racist chatbots to faulty automated driving systems that result in crashes and injury. And even when A.I. improves quickly, it often takes a while to filter down into products and services that people actually use. An A.I. breakthrough at Google or OpenAI today doesn’t mean that your Roomba will be able to write novels tomorrow.But the best A.I. systems are now so capable — and improving at such fast rates — that the conversation in Silicon Valley is starting to shift. Fewer experts are confidently predicting that we have years or even decades to prepare for a wave of world-changing A.I.; many now believe that major changes are right around the corner, for better or worse.Ajeya Cotra, a senior analyst with Open Philanthropy who studies A.I. risk, estimated two years ago that there was a 15 percent chance of “transformational A.I.” — which she and others have defined as A.I. that is good enough to usher in large-scale economic and societal changes, such as eliminating most white-collar knowledge jobs — emerging by 2036.But in a recent post, Ms. Cotra raised that to a 35 percent chance, citing the rapid improvement of systems like GPT-3.“A.I. systems can go from adorable and useless toys to very powerful products in a surprisingly short period of time,” Ms. Cotra told me. “People should take more seriously that A.I. could change things soon, and that could be really scary.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThere are, to be fair, plenty of skeptics who say claims of A.I. progress are overblown. They’ll tell you that A.I. is still nowhere close to becoming sentient, or replacing humans in a wide variety of jobs. They’ll say that models like GPT-3 and LaMDA are just glorified parrots, blindly regurgitating their training data, and that we’re still decades away from creating true A.G.I. — artificial general intelligence — that is capable of “thinking” for itself.There are also tech optimists who believe that A.I. progress is accelerating, and who want it to accelerate faster. Speeding A.I.’s rate of improvement, they believe, will give us new tools to cure diseases, colonize space and avert ecological disaster.I’m not asking you to take a side in this debate. All I’m saying is: You should be paying closer attention to the real, tangible developments that are fueling it.After all, A.I. that works doesn’t stay in a lab. It gets built into the social media apps we use every day, in the form of Facebook feed-ranking algorithms, YouTube recommendations and TikTok “For You” pages. It makes its way into weapons used by the military and software used by children in their classrooms. Banks use A.I. to determine who’s eligible for loans, and police departments use it to investigate crimes.Even if the skeptics are right, and A.I. doesn’t achieve human-level sentience for many years, it’s easy to see how systems like GPT-3, LaMDA and DALL-E 2 could become a powerful force in society. In a few years, the vast majority of the photos, videos and text we encounter on the internet could be A.I.-generated. Our online interactions could become stranger and more fraught, as we struggle to figure out which of our conversational partners are human and which are convincing bots. And tech-savvy propagandists could use the technology to churn out targeted misinformation on a vast scale, distorting the political process in ways we won’t see coming.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIt’s a cliché, in the A.I. world, to say things like “we need to have a societal conversation about A.I. risk.” There are already plenty of Davos panels, TED talks, think tanks and A.I. ethics committees out there, sketching out contingency plans for a dystopian future.What’s missing is a shared, value-neutral way of talking about what today’s A.I. systems are actually capable of doing, and what specific risks and opportunities those capabilities present.I think three things could help here.First, regulators and politicians need to get up to speed.Because of how new many of these A.I. systems are, few public officials have any firsthand experience with tools like GPT-3 or DALL-E 2, nor do they grasp how quickly progress is happening at the A.I. frontier.We’ve seen a few efforts to close the gap — Stanford’s Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence recently held a three-day “A.I. boot camp” for congressional staff members, for example — but we need more politicians and regulators to take an interest in the technology. (And I don’t mean that they need to start stoking fears of an A.I. apocalypse, Andrew Yang-style. Even reading a book like Brian Christian’s “The Alignment Problem” or understanding a few basic details about how a model like GPT-3 works would represent enormous progress.)Otherwise, we could end up with a repeat of what happened with social media companies after the 2016 election — a collision of Silicon Valley power and Washington ignorance, which resulted in nothing but gridlock and testy hearings.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSecond, big tech companies investing billions in A.I. development — the Googles, Metas and OpenAIs of the world — need to do a better job of explaining what they’re working on, without sugarcoating or soft-pedaling the risks. Right now, many of the biggest A.I. models are developed behind closed doors, using private data sets and tested only by internal teams. When information about them is made public, it’s often either watered down by corporate P.R. or buried in inscrutable scientific papers.Downplaying A.I. risks to avoid backlash may be a smart short-term strategy, but tech companies won’t survive long term if they’re seen as having a hidden A.I. agenda that’s at odds with the public interest. And if these companies won’t open up voluntarily, A.I. engineers should go around their bosses and talk directly to policymakers and journalists themselves.Third, the news media needs to do a better job of explaining A.I. progress to nonexperts. Too often, journalists — and I admit I’ve been a guilty party here — rely on outdated sci-fi shorthand to translate what’s happening in A.I. to a general audience. We sometimes compare large language models to Skynet and HAL 9000, and flatten promising machine learning breakthroughs to panicky “The robots are coming!” headlines that we think will resonate with readers. Occasionally, we betray our ignorance by illustrating articles about software-based A.I. models with photos of hardware-based factory robots — an error that is as inexplicable as slapping a photo of a BMW on a story about bicycles.In a broad sense, most people think about A.I. narrowly as it relates to us — Will it take my job? Is it better or worse than me at Skill X or Task Y? — rather than trying to understand all of the ways A.I. is evolving, and what that might mean for our future.I’ll do my part, by writing about A.I. in all its complexity and weirdness without resorting to hyperbole or Hollywood tropes. But we all need to start adjusting our mental models to make space for the new, incredible machines in our midst.Kevin Roose is a technology columnist and the author of “Futureproof: 9 Rules for Humans in the Age of Automation.” More about Kevin RooseA version of this article appears in print on Aug. 25, 2022, Section B, Page 1 of the New York edition with the headline: A.I.

Parkinson’s disease is notoriously difficult to diagnose as it relies primarily on the appearance of motor symptoms such as tremors, stiffness, and slowness, but these symptoms often appear several years after the disease onset. Now, Dina Katabi, the Thuan (1990) and Nicole Pham Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) at MIT and principal investigator at MIT Jameel Clinic, and her team have developed an artificial intelligence model that can detect Parkinson’s just from reading a person’s breathing patterns.
The tool in question is a neural network, a series of connected algorithms that mimic the way a human brain works, capable of assessing whether someone has Parkinson’s from their nocturnal breathing — i.e., breathing patterns that occur while sleeping. The neural network, which was trained by MIT PhD student Yuzhe Yang and postdoc Yuan Yuan, is also able to discern the severity of someone’s Parkinson’s disease and track the progression of their disease over time. 
Yang is first author on a new paper describing the work, published today in Nature Medicine. Katabi, who is also an affiliate of the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and director of the Center for Wireless Networks and Mobile Computing, is the senior author. They are joined by Yuan and 12 colleagues from Rutgers University, the University of Rochester Medical Center, the Mayo Clinic, Massachusetts General Hospital, and the Boston University College of Health and Rehabilition.
Over the years, researchers have investigated the potential of detecting Parkinson’s using cerebrospinal fluid and neuroimaging, but such methods are invasive, costly, and require access to specialized medical centers, making them unsuitable for frequent testing that could otherwise provide early diagnosis or continuous tracking of disease progression.
The MIT researchers demonstrated that the artificial intelligence assessment of Parkinson's can be done every night at home while the person is asleep and without touching their body. To do so, the team developed a device with the appearance of a home Wi-Fi router, but instead of providing internet access, the device emits radio signals, analyzes their reflections off the surrounding environment, and extracts the subject’s breathing patterns without any bodily contact. The breathing signal is then fed to the neural network to assess Parkinson’s in a passive manner, and there is zero effort needed from the patient and caregiver.
“A relationship between Parkinson’s and breathing was noted as early as 1817, in the work of Dr. James Parkinson. This motivated us to consider the potential of detecting the disease from one’s breathing without looking at movements,” Katabi says. “Some medical studies have shown that respiratory symptoms manifest years before motor symptoms, meaning that breathing attributes could be promising for risk assessment prior to Parkinson’s diagnosis.”
The fastest-growing neurological disease in the world, Parkinson’s is the second-most common neurological disorder, after Alzheimer's disease. In the United States alone, it afflicts over 1 million people and has an annual economic burden of $51.9 billion. The research team’s algorithm was tested on 7,687 individuals, including 757 Parkinson’s patients.
Katabi notes that the study has important implications for Parkinson’s drug development and clinical care. “In terms of drug development, the results can enable clinical trials with a significantly shorter duration and fewer participants, ultimately accelerating the development of new therapies. In terms of clinical care, the approach can help in the assessment of Parkinson’s patients in traditionally underserved communities, including those who live in rural areas and those with difficulty leaving home due to limited mobility or cognitive impairment,” she says.
“We’ve had no therapeutic breakthroughs this century, suggesting that our current approaches to evaluating new treatments is suboptimal,” says Ray Dorsey, a professor of neurology at the University of Rochester and Parkinson’s specialist who co-authored the paper. Dorsey adds that the study is likely one of the largest sleep studies ever conducted on Parkinson’s. “We have very limited information about manifestations of the disease in their natural environment and [Katabi’s] device allows you to get objective, real-world assessments of how people are doing at home. The analogy I like to draw [of current Parkinson’s assessments] is a street lamp at night, and what we see from the street lamp is a very small segment … [Katabi’s] entirely contactless sensor helps us illuminate the darkness.”
This research was performed in collaboration with the University of Rochester, Mayo Clinic, and Massachusetts General Hospital, and is sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, with partial support by the National Science Foundation and the Michael J. Fox Foundation.

The Washington PostWashington Post reporter Pranshu Verma writes about how Prof. Dina Katabi and her colleagues developed a new AI tool that could be used to help detect early signs of Parkinson’s by analyzing a patient’s breathing patterns. For diseases like Parkinson’s “one of the biggest challenges is that we need to get to [it] very early on, before the damage has mostly happened in the brain,” said Katabi. “So being able to detect Parkinson’s early is essential.”

The Boston GlobeA new tool for diagnosing Parkinson’s disease developed by MIT researchers uses an AI system to monitor a person’s breathing patterns during sleep, reports Hiawatha Bray for The Boston Globe. “The system is capable of detecting the chest movements of a sleeping person, even if they’re under a blanket or lying on their side,” writes Bray. “It uses software to filter out all other extraneous information, until only the breathing data remains. Using it for just one night provides enough data for a diagnosis.”

ForbesForbes contributor Jennifer Kite-Powell spotlights how MIT researchers created a new AI system that analyzes radio waves bouncing off a person while they sleep to monitor breathing patterns and help identify Parkinson’s disease. “The device can also measure how bad the disease has become and could be used to track Parkinson's progression over time,” writes Kite-Powell.

WBURBoston Globe reporter Hiawatha Bray speaks with Radio Boston host Tiziana Dearing about how MIT researchers developed an artificial intelligence model that uses a person’s breathing patterns to detect Parkinson’s Disease. The researchers “hope to continue doing this for other diseases like Alzheimer’s and potentially other neurological diseases,” says Bray.

Fierce BiotechResearchers at MIT have developed an artificial intelligence sensor that can track the progression of Parkinson’s disease in patients based on their breathing while they sleep, reports Conor Hale for Fierce Biotech. “The device emits radio waves and captures their reflection to read small changes in its immediate environment,” writes Hale. “It works like a radar, but in this case, the device senses the rise and fall of a person’s chest.”

STATResearchers at MIT and other institutions have developed an artificial intelligence tool that can analyze changes in nighttime breathing to detect and track the progression of Parkinson’s disease, reports Casey Ross for STAT. “The AI was able to accurately flag Parkinson’s using one night of breathing data collected from a belt worn around the abdomen or from a passive monitoring system that tracks breathing using a low-power radio signal,” writes Ross.

Robots are becoming more ubiquitous in the workplace but that doesn’t mean people are accepting them.
In a new study by researchers with the University of Central Florida, workers in countries with greater amounts of income and social inequality were found to be more likely to perceive robots and artificial intelligence as job threats.
This means in countries such as Sweden, Denmark, Finland and the Netherlands, robots could be met with more open arms than in countries such as Spain or Greece, where there is more income inequality.
The study, which examined countries in Europe, was published recently in the journal Technology, Mind and Behavior.
The study focused on European countries, but study co-author Mindy Shoss, a professor in UCF’s Department of Psychology, says the findings could also help better understand the issue in America.
“The U.S. always ranks pretty high on inequality and societal inequality,” the researcher says. “Given that, I would suspect that there probably are, on average, similar negative views of AI and robot technology in the U.S.”
Shoss says that in highly unequal societies there are greater inequalities in income, health and education, as well as more attention given to where people stand on the social ladder. This leads to anxiety and uncertainty about income, status, and job security.
“Countries that have more people in unequal standing, on average, tend to see these technologies more as a threat,” she says.
The study used data from the regularly conducted Eurobarometer public opinion survey to examine if there was an association between workers viewing AI and robots as threats and country inequality. More than 13,000 respondents from 28 European Union member states were included in their analysis. The data were collected during March 2017.
The researchers found a positive association between income inequality, as operationalized by an economic measure known as the Gini index, and perceptions that AI and robots pose threats of general job loss.
Shoss, who studies organizational psychology, became interested in the research through her work with the hospitality industry and the technology that’s coming to that sector, such as service robots.
“We’re at this point in society where there are companies making AI and robotics and marketing them for the workforce,” Shoss says.
“There’s a lot of potential of these technologies to help make work better by doing dangerous tasks or giving people more flexibility, but there’s also some risk involved in these technologies,” she says. “And the implication from our research is that if you’re going to try to develop robots or AI technology in a highly unequal society, there might be more barriers to getting people to adopt that kind of technology.”
Shoss says that based on these findings, inequalities should be taken into account when designing and implementing technology, including addressing ways advanced technology could improve workers’ jobs or incomes, in order to increase acceptance.
Katherine Ciarlante ’19MS, a doctoral student in industrial and organizational psychology who earned her master’s in the same subject at UCF, was the study’s co-author.
The research was funded by the National Institute Occupational Safety and Health under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Shoss earned her doctoral degree in industrial and organizational psychology from the University of Houston. She joined UCF’s Department of Psychology, part of the College of Sciences, in 2015.

As defined by EY, intelligent automation (IA) refers to the integration of robotics with multiple components from different emerging technologies. These software robots operate as virtual employees, reliably automating manual, repetitive tasks at scale.EY adds that ""when robotic, intelligent, and autonomous systems are integrated, the result is intelligent automation, widening the scope of potential tasks and processes that can be automated. This powerful combination brings transformation across the whole spectrum of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and the Internet of things.""Within the oil and gas sector, data-driven analytics are driving safety and productivity improvements, but businesses face an uphill challenge to implement automated artificial intelligence (AI) work flows based on a standardized data model in a manner that is integrated with standard work processes.Silos and data sets are seen as the main barriers within organizations and across the energy industry at large, which has led to such initiatives as the Open AI Energy Initiative (OAI), a first-of-its-kind open ecosystem of AI solutions involving Shell, C3 AI, Baker Hughes, and Microsoft.To add more perspective on this initiative, Dan Jeavons, Shell's data science general manager, who has led the initiative’s development, and Christophe Vaessen, Shell's general manager for commercial, EU, Middle East, and Africa, who leads commercialization efforts of Shell’s intellectual propertyto third parties, spoke about technological advancements in their industry.Vaessen told Shell.com, “Digital technology is a key enabler to facilitate the way we are doing business. As an energy company, we have to adapt to remain at the forefront of this transformation. The three previous industrial revolutions have demonstrated that not only the most advanced industries were successful but the ones that were able to partner, develop, and work together effectively were the ones that often stood out. In the OAI platform, we are building an open environment that enables all parties to work together toward a common ambition.”The OAI is an open platform where companies can plug in and commercialize their apps. This includes not only international oil companies but also different sectors, such as cement or mining companies, that are running large operations and looking for digital tools to help with predictive maintenance.As industrial facilities require robust and supportable applications, C3 AI provides a series of apps that provide predictive maintenance and reliability capabilities, while Microsoft provides the base platform.Jeavons added that Shell is “committed to working as part of an ecosystem—bringing multiple players together to move forward in the AI space because no one company can solve the world’s AI problems.”“Furthermore, speed is paramount. The energy transition is forcing us to change more quickly, and the digital transformation of society is also accelerating. Our view is that alliances are critical to accelerating our progress and enabling AI deployment at scale.”As founding members of the OAI, Shell takes a leading role in developing a curated ecosystem of integrated solutions and creating fair value exchange for the companies that build on top of the platform.“The nearest analog to what we’re trying to do with the OAI is to create an Apple App Store for the process industry,” Jeavons added.“We have a standardized data model based on open standards. We have a platform that creates consistency, scalability, and supportability to drive adoption. And, on top of that, we are aiming to build solutions that respect expertise and create fair value exchange.”Shell is focused on further developing predictive-maintenance solutions that can help plant operators take preemptive action to avoid shutdowns based on equipment failure, Vaessen said.“In the medium term, we would like to expand the offer by making it more integrated and include offerings to assist plant optimization, inspection, and sustainability. We want to bring in other elements in the value chain and, therefore, offer a full ecosystem for plant operations.“Partnership for the OAI will be incentivized by the solutions offered, and today, Shell is providing a first wave of solutions. As the platform gains more adopters, its offerings will increase over time. Through collaboration and sharing technology, we are aiming to build an ecosystem where adopters will, together, be developing a fully integrated solution,” Vaessen said.Read the full story here.

The use of artificial intelligence for health in the Africa Region
25th August 2022, Lomé, Togo

 

Background
In June 2021, the WHO Regional Office for Africa (WHO AFRO) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), with support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and partners from the Health Harmonization for African (HHA), convened an Artificial Intelligence (AI) technical workshop aimed at assessing the penetration of AI for Health and generating recommendations for the use of AI in health in the African region. The event was under the theme “Health Status Transformation and the Role of AI for health and pandemic preparedness in the African Context ”. This workshop was against the backdrop of the WHO global strategy on digital health  and the WHO AFRO Framework for Implementing the Global Strategy on Digital Health in The WHO African Region . The event brought together participants from Ministries of Health, Ministries of ICT, Academia, the private sector, and Non-Governmental Organizations. In the same year, WHO AFRO launched a digital health survey, which included an AI section. The survey was based on the 2015 WHO Global Observatory on eHealth. The WHO AFRO regional office also generated additional reference materials relevant to AI for health in the context of the African region.
In 2021, WHO headquarters released an AI guidance document entitled “Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence for Health ”. The guidance document was developed to assist WHO Member States in implementing AI for health. WHO has also developed several training programmes aimed at raising AI and its application in health, including a recent course based on the WHO guidance on Ethics and Governance of AI.
It is recognized that the developed world is benefiting from more advanced analysis and use of data. Technologies like AI have the potential to offer new insights and tools to improve clinical decision-making and predictive analytics for health emergency preparedness, mitigate workforce shortages, tailor programs targeting areas of greatest need, improve forecasting of disease outbreaks, and bring efficiencies to health service delivery. Realizing the potential of digital health and AI to achieve development goals will require collaboratively addressing multiple challenges, including strengthening underlying digital infrastructure and digital health systems, working to improve data quality, responsible management and sharing of available data, and eventually trust and utilization of data to inform strategic planning.
Furthermore, the ITU and WHO, through various collaborative activities that include the Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for health , aimed to establish standardized assessment frameworks that can support the evaluation of AI-based methods for health and, through joint capacity-building programmes , have delivered training to enhance and strengthen digital skills for health.
Globally, the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered an unprecedented demand for digital technology-based solutions in screening populations, tracking infections, and minimizing direct human contact. Using different technologies at every step has brought efficiencies in tracking and tracing contacts, testing, and case management, to mention but a few. Most importantly, technology has played and continues to play a vital role in protecting medical personnel by limiting direct contact with patients, disinfecting controlled environments, and disseminating public health and emergency messages through telehealth. By leveraging the use of digital technology in Africa’s health sector, different health crises can be managed better, and health care systems can be strengthened through effective and more efficient digital mechanisms.
The African Context 
Africa is, in many ways, poised to make increased use of Digital and AI technologies due to the rapid increase of mobile phone coverage and use . However, significant gaps in the digital health ecosystems of many African countries remain that need to be addressed in order to orchestrate wider utilization and adoption of these technologies . Realizing the full potential of digital technology, including AI, requires strengthening the policy and the regulatory environment, system infrastructure, sustainable financing, security and workforce capacity, and diversity in the stakeholders involved in digital health and technology innovation. While it is critical that Africa is not left out of new advances, it is equally important to approach frontier technologies thoughtfully.
The Ministerial side event on the use of Artificial intelligence in the health sector in the African countries
Following the afore mentioned technical meeting on AI , together with various knowledge generation activities on AI conducted by the WHO AFRO and the USAID, the Regional Office (WHO AFRO) and the ITU, with support from the USAID, will be convening a ministerial side event on the use of AI for health, in the context of the African region. The ministerial side event will bring together high-level government policy-makers across Africa to discuss critical policy dimensions of strengthening the health system through AI and other relevant digital solutions. The meeting will lay the foundation for responsibly developing and adopting frontier technologies such as AI in health systems in Africa. The ministerial side event will take place along the sidelines of the 72nd WHO Regional Committee for Africa . 
Ministerial side event objectives
The objectives of the ministerial side event are to: 

Showcase AI-driven health solutions developed and implemented by the Member States in the African Region.
Identify concrete actions for shaping policy and enabling environments to foster digital technologies for accelerated improvements in health and related development programs.

Ministerial side event expected outputs
 The expected outputs of the Ministerial event include:

Commitments from Ministers of Health, Ministers of ICT, and all stakeholders to foster an enabling environment for the use of digital technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the health sector at the national level.
Enhanced adoption on the use of AI and other digital technologies to transform the health sector in the African Region.

Do I need to be an engineer or have a PhD to get a job in AI?Lack of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) talent or the “STEM pipeline issue” is often cited by the tech industry to explain away its lack of diversity without acknowledging the self-selection bias that’s pervasive in this male-dominated industry. Given the proliferation of coding camps and with AI narratives in the media dominated by tech bro’s, it’s easy to assume that all AI roles require engineering expertise or advanced degrees in STEM .While there is a clear need for more investment in critical fields like STEM where women and BIPOC have been historically underrepresented, there is also an urgent need to reduce the barriers for those from non-engineering and non-academic disciplines.As AI adoption grows across diverse industries and functional areas, it is creating new opportunities for those outside the tech bubble to build the future of AI.

One is that despite the hype, many companies are still in the “build and test” phase where they believe they need more technical expertise instead of governance or ethics-related expertise. Another reason is that the “newness” of these roles is leading many hiring managers/recruiters into assigning more value to advanced technical degrees while undervaluing the importance of multidisciplinary expertise and relevant industry experience, which filters out many qualified candidates in the process.The bottom line is this, if we are serious about building and deploying responsible AI solutions, we need to challenge our antiquated ideas about AI expertise and make it easier for with more talented folks with non-(stereo)typical backgrounds to join this space.If you currently work in and/or are recruiting for non-engineering roles in AI, leave a comment or reach out via email (DiversityinAI at gmail dot com).",NewsArticle,,,https://becominghuman.ai/here-are-12-ai-jobs-that-dont-require-a-phd-or-an-engineering-degree-92dfdc3d925c,Here are 12 AI Jobs that Don’t Require a PhD or an Engineering Degree,,Here are 12 AI Jobs that Don’t Require a PhD or an Engineering Degree,2022-08-23T17:07:43.190Z,2023-04-12T15:52:49.681Z,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Mia Shah-Dand', 'url': 'https://miad.medium.com'}",['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*Rd9IZ3SLf5vJJ_qCd6dz9w.jpeg'],"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Becoming Human: Artificial Intelligence Magazine', 'url': 'becominghuman.ai', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 146, 'height': 60, 'url': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:292/1*1fYpRTTpKQNa0zuEPe3itg.png'}}",https://becominghuman.ai/here-are-12-ai-jobs-that-dont-require-a-phd-or-an-engineering-degree-92dfdc3d925c,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-08-23T17:07:43.190Z,,,['Mia Shah-Dand'],,,,,92dfdc3d925c,,

1. AI in Communication – A New Era?
The challenge: Email, SMS, social media and other online services have become indispensable. We are all bombarded with messages, information and advertising. We are no longer masters of our perception and suffer from distraction – increasingly even while we sleep. So we are slipping into an agitated society, where we become more and more agitated about what we perceive. The anxiety is fed by the filter and echo bubbles we build around ourselves to cope with the chaos. The problem is that these provide one-way information, making interpersonal communication difficult in the analogue age and almost impossible in the digital age.
The goal: To overcome this powerlessness in the digital age and to communicate successfully (more successfully), we need to become more digitally fit. This digital fitness will be so important in the future because we are increasingly outsourcing communication to applications that work with artificial intelligence.
Status quo: AI has already found its way into communications in a variety of ways. Privately, we know it from voice assistants on smartphones (e.g. SIRI) or in the home (e.g. Alexa).
But if you speak nonsense into the Alexa box, only nonsense comes out.
AI is generally understood as the ability of machines to mimic or imitate human behaviour. In the field of communications, cognitive AI, i.e. AI or Generative AI that is capable of imitating human behaviour, is most commonly used.
Opportunities for business: In business communications, however, AI is really taking off.
Five examples for business communication with AI

One example of this is speech analysis. By analyzing speech patterns, AI can detect whether a person is emotionally charged or not. This can be helpful in customer conversations, for example, to see whether the customer is satisfied or not. AI can also already be very helpful in translating speech. By analyzing speech patterns, it can detect and correct errors that a human would overlook.
In social networks, AI already plays a major role today. For example, chatbots are increasingly being used to interact with users. Here, too, speech analytics can be used to detect users’ moods and offer them appropriate help.
In marketing communications, it can be used to improve a chatbot’s voice output or make it easier to search for specific information. AI is also being used more and more in social networks, for example to play out personalized advertising. In this context, AI can be used both for content creation and for the analysis and targeting of communication measures.
The creation of personalized content is a key benefit that AI offers. By analyzing user behavior, AI can create content that is tailored to the exact needs of the user. Among other things, it can display messages or advertisements that are precisely tailored to the recipient’s interest.
AI also facilitates the segmentation of target groups and the targeting of communication measures. By analyzing data, companies can find out exactly which target group is interesting for which product or service. This enables companies to target their communication measures specifically at the relevant target groups and thus maximize their impact.

However, the risks associated with the use of artificial intelligence in communication should not be ignored.
2. What are the risks of AI in communication?
One of the greatest dangers is distortion of communication. Distortion is usually caused by a lack of information between the sender and receiver. No technology can help if the artificial intelligence only has one-way access to certain information.
Everyone knows an example of distorted communication from the analogue world. If I’m talking to my friend and he says something that hurts me, I might think he meant it. But in fact he might not have meant it at all. Maybe he was just teasing me. Or maybe he wasn’t in a good mood himself and I misinterpreted his words.
Another example of the distortion of communication in the digital world is the social networking site Facebook. On Facebook, people can create their own profile with all sorts of information about themselves, such as where they work, their favourite music or their political views. Other Facebook users can see this information and draw conclusions about the person. But people can also spread a lot of false information about themselves on Facebook, which can distort communication.
Digital communication is a process in which information is exchanged between many people. In a perfect world, these communication processes would run smoothly and without distortion. Unfortunately, the world is not perfect and communication suffers from distortion.
The most common type of distortion is called “semantic distortion”. This type of distortion occurs when the meaning of a message is misinterpreted. Another common problem is called ‘syntactic distortion’. This happens when a message is misunderstood because it is not phrased correctly.
3. This is how to develop your digital communication with AI
As with any other type of communication, there are some essential rules to follow when communicating digitally. These include:

Be clear and concise: When communicating digitally, it’s especially important to be clear and concise. Since you can’t talk face-to-face, misunderstandings can easily arise. So make sure your message is as clear as possible.
Listen: Good communication is a two-way process. Listening is at least as important as talking. Make sure you understand what the other person is saying before you respond. This will help avoid misunderstandings.
Stay calm: It’s easy to blow up and lose your temper when you’re arguing with someone. But it’s especially important to stay calm in digital communication. Avoid sending nasty or abusive messages – this will only escalate the conflict.
Stay empathetic: Be sensitive to the other person’s needs. Find out what he or she wants to know and focus your communication on that. Ask questions to get feedback and new ideas.
Practice digital fitness daily: Practice digital fitness on a regular basis. Keep up with the latest developments in the digital world and try out new tools and apps. This will keep you fit for the challenges of digital communication.
Personal Growth – Stay open to the world: Be open to criticism and suggestions. Take them seriously and rethink your own position. Be willing to change when it makes sense.

Remember: Change means finding solutions to problems.
4. Conclusion: AI opportunities harbor risks
All in all: AI in communication is one of the most important developments. It allows machines to have human conversations. This can be very useful for companies, for example by reducing the number of customer service representatives. AI in communication is also interesting for individuals, offering a new way to play with exchanges.
The outlook: In the future, it will continue to grow in importance and make many things possible that seem unimaginable today. However, AI in communications is not yet perfect. Nevertheless, AI in communications is already an exciting technology with a lot of potential. In the future, it will get even better and more people will be able to use it.
The most important thing? – People: But technology is only one side of the coin. The people, the users, also need to develop if they are to make effective use of the opportunities, whether privately or professionally. Technology is only a means to an end. It provides tools for practical applications and gives impetus to make current tasks more efficient and productive. But without human cognition, any technology remains soulless and interchangeable.

This trend has led to automating processes that used to be manually done by humans. An example is the usage of chatbots to respond to customers instead of living customer service agents. In most cases, AI implementation boosts efficiency and productivity, so its adoption will unlikely slow down soon. Web developers are also getting in on this trend as artificial intelligence makes their work easier and websites better..What Is Artificial Intelligence?.Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that makes computers simulate human intelligence to perform various tasks. Computers use machine learning and natural language processing to achieve this. This technology is so advanced that sometimes it is difficult to distinguish between human and AI interactions. Artificial intelligence systems are built to learn and adapt to human inputs to solve problems..With machine learning, AI systems can improve their performance without receiving new instructions from the developer. Instead, the machine will learn new behaviors from all the data it receives and its interactions with them. Web developers use AI on websites to improve user experience. That is how social media sites personalize user feeds according to the accounts and posts they interact with..Additionally, AI helps web developers behind the scenes to build websites. Some software applications allow them to review page elements, find errors, troubleshoot problems, and optimize page performance. One of such applications is the Safari Web Inspector tool that iOS developers use with Corellium to debug web pages to be accessed via the Safari browser..Benefits of Developing Websites With AI Implementation.As implied earlier, AI can be used in different stages of web development. Here are some ways in which its implementation is beneficial:.1. Improved User Experience.AI can adapt to website user preferences and tailor content to suit their taste. Web developers implement this feature into websites so they can improve every user's experience. On social networks, AI generates suggestions on people or pages users can follow to improve their experience. Consequently, showing them the content they want to see would make them spend more time on the website..2. Better Search Results.Most websites have search features that help people find the information they need. Developers use AI to make websites display search results related to what the searcher wants. Different people might enter the same search query, but results may vary based on the data the AI system has gathered about the user. This data can be location, age, and interests..3. Effective Website Building.Designing websites from scratch can be tedious, but AI can make the process bearable. The backend of web pages contains many lines of code which might need periodic adjustments. Developers can scan the web pages with AI-based software during the building phase to detect and deal with errors. This will optimize the website for the device it will be viewed on..4. Efficient Marketing Strategy.Big data is valuable to e-commerce websites as it helps them conduct proper market analysis to understand customer demand. With AI, websites can find out what users will likely purchase and suggest that item. This feature increases conversions, boost sales and gives the website owner insight on how to improve their advertising efforts..5. Customized Online Store Experience.Similar to the above point, this is exclusive to e-commerce sites. Implementing AI allows the website to tailor product recommendations to user preferences. This allows the user to feel like the store was designed just for them..6. Enhanced Communication.Websites have different designs, and some can be difficult to navigate. AI, in the form of chatbots, has helped with this issue. Chatbots can act as customer support to assist all users who simultaneously visit a website without any delay. Machine learning allows these chatbots to improve their communication with website users over time..Will Artificial Intelligence Take Over Web Development?.This is unlikely to happen because human intelligence still supersedes computers. Also, human wants are diverse and insatiable, so AI might find it challenging to deal with every problem it encounters. However, it is a valuable addition to web development. It helps to simplify complex coding problems and suggest layouts to web designers. These allow websites to be developed faster..What Is the Future of Artificial Intelligence in Web Development?.The role of AI in web development is massive. Its prominence has created business opportunities that would not have otherwise existed. For example, ride-sharing platforms like Uber and Lyft use AI to pair drivers and riders in real-time. Their machine learning algorithm can predict when there will be demand for the service, so drivers can use this information to maximize their income..Now, these companies are amongst the largest in the world. Many enterprises use artificial intelligence to gather online insights to improve their operations and surpass their competitors. With all these benefits, it is difficult to predict that AI will lose its prominence in web development. It is likely to be used more and improved over time..Endnote.Artificial Intelligence is significant to web development in many ways. It makes it easy for web developers to test their web pages while being built and improves the user experience on the website. They also support advertisement efforts as companies can collect valuable consumer data and structure their products or service offerings accordingly..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
