Advances in technology often generate headlines about how they will change the way we work. In this regard, generative AI has made more impact than most – with OpenAI’s ChatGPT quickly becoming the fastest-growing consumer application in history, reaching 100 million users just two months after launch. It’s no surprise that most organisations today are exploring the potential benefits generative AI can deliver, and the significant impact it could have on productivity, creativity, employee wellbeing and the future of work. HR leaders have a crucial role to play in helping to empower their executive teams, dispelling the myths and preparing the organisation for what the future holds.  Harnessing the potential Generative AI is a standout development, promising to revolutionise the future of work by streamlining and automating routine and repetitive tasks, allowing employees to focus on the more creative or complex aspects of their jobs. In turn, this can enhance efficiency, productivity and be more rewarding for people across a multitude of functions within every organisation.  One of the findings of Finastra’s recent Financial Services State of the Nation Survey highlights the excitement about the pace of technological change happening within the financial services industry today (and no doubt other industries are evolving in similar ways). We asked 956 professionals at managerial level in financial institutions across nine countries what they felt about advances in technology and an overwhelming 87 per cent of respondents expressed their personal enthusiasm about the opportunities ahead.  
It’s imperative that HR professionals work closely with senior leadership to harness this excitement, helping to empower their organisations to leverage the new technology and the more productive ways of working, allaying any fears people may have and helping them adapt. At Finastra the CHRO partners with the CTIO to co-sponsor the AI steering group.In times of technological transformation, it’s essential to balance creativity and excitement with guidance and governance, moving as slowly as required, to adhere to high standards of ethics and responsibility. Recognising that successful generative AI integration requires a robust framework of internal policies and oversight; employees must be placed at the centre of all activity, with robust security measures put in place.  Sponsors overseeing AI implementations and generative AI labs will play a pivotal role in managing governance and mitigating risks and in fostering a culture of responsibility. By providing skills, safe tools and a secure environment, alongside a holistic governance model, companies can use generative AI tools to unlock the potential of their people, as well as boosting productivity and wellbeing.  Prioritising upskilling Finastra is actively investing in generative AI to unlock the potential of our ~8,000 people. We’ve made a conscious effort to be at the forefront but ensuring we are getting the foundations right, such as security, compliance and testing, is critical. This is paving the way for us to progress at scale and pace. We’ve ensured that all employees have access to a comprehensive generative AI skills training programme, as well as a comprehensive set of policies for usage, including legal and compliance. Knowing that it can be natural for people to resist or to fear change, we also have a variety of internal channels and communities in place that enable our teams to interact with experts, ask questions and share knowledge in a safe and supportive environment.  In addition, we are actively investigating HR-specific use cases to improve efficiencies across our operations, including a generative AI-enabled virtual assistant to support the 2,000+ queries and transactions that we receive monthly to our people portal.  Strategic HR leaders should be mindful of the potential downsides of reducing routine work tasks in the workplace. While this shift may improve productivity and efficiency, it could also lead to increased stress levels as the proportion of highly complex tasks leaders need to process during the working day significantly accelerates. To mitigate these risks, leaders should educate line managers about the importance of understanding their own physiology, including circadian rhythms, chronotypes, sleep and nutrition.By creating a culture of self awareness and balance, organisations can leverage the power of AI to drive business growth while also supporting employee wellbeing. This holistic approach to workforce management can become a critical differentiator for organisations that prioritise the health and wellbeing of their employees, leading to a more engaged and motivated workforce.Looking to the future The future of work is on the brink of a transformative era driven by generative AI. We recognise its potential to transform our organisation, our operations and our products, but it must be used responsibly and with understanding. Ensuring our people are able to explore generative AI in a safe and compliant way has been a fundamental consideration and shaped our usage policy.We are always exploring ways to attract and retain the best people and believe that it is our responsibility to provide access to the tools and training that improves their everyday life and unlocks their potential. We believe fluency in generative AI is a requisite life skill, not just a Finastra skill. For that reason, we are investing in a robust training programme, secure tools and a compliant operating environment for our people, our developers and our customers. The take up of these skilling modules from all parts of our organisation has been outstanding with first-class content curated by our skills centre of expertise.  Our flagship three-day ‘Gen AI (X)po’ that ran in October saw the entire organisation coalesce around AI. In these few short days we saw more than 16,000 hours of learning take place. HR has been under immense pressure in recent years. But now is the time to embrace change and innovation rather than yearn for the former status quo. HR leaders have a unique opportunity to partner with peers to shape the future of organisations and be at the forefront as AI and human capability become interdependent. Helen Cook is chief people and communications officer at Finastra

A little over a year ago, no one was talking about generative AI. Now, it’s the dominant topic of top-level events like CES and the World Economic Forum.

A lot has changed in that year, of course, driven by the collective enthusiasm for tools like ChatGPT and Dall-E. Millions of us are now using it in our daily lives – as evidenced by some of the statistics I highlight below. New products and services built around large language models, as well as image, sound, and video generation, are appearing every day.


Let's take a look at some facts and figures, focusing on those that I feel tell the story of generative AI’s breakthrough year.

The most mind-blowing thing, though, is that with investment (and hype) continuing to flow into the sector, the only way I can see these numbers going over the next year is up!

75% of professionals expect that generative AI will cause “significant or disruptive change in the nature of their industry’s competition” over the next three years, according to McKinsey’s research.
PROMOTED
This is interesting because it shows lots of us believe generative AI can be useful beyond the more obvious use cases, like automating routine marketing and admin processes, and used to create new business opportunities.
70% of Generation Z use the technology and 52% of them trust it to help them make decisions, according to Salesforce.

This fits with findings in the same research that 68% of those who never use generative AI are members of the Gen X or Baby Boomer generations. It’s no surprise that younger people are quicker to understand new technology and adopt it into their lives. For more mature members of the workforce, it creates an opportunity to stay relevant rather than start slipping behind!

This statistic was given at the end of 2023. At the start of the year, it was reported that the generative AI tool that kicked off the current gold rush was attracting the same number of monthly users. The website of the parent company, OpenAI, attracts 1.5 million monthly visits.
86 percent of IT leaders expect generative AI to soon play a prominent role in their organizations, says Salesforce.
With its ability to write code, troubleshoot complex technical issues and change the way we think about data, IT workers are among those who are most exposed to the potential benefits and challenges of AI. If this is your field, continuous learning and adaptability are key to staying ahead.
Two million developers are working on apps built on OpenAI’s platform
This includes most Fortune 500 companies, according to the company’s own data. Building apps on OpenAI involves creating services that access its tools, like GPT-4 or Dall-E 2, through the company’s APIs. A popular use case is creating custom ChatGPT-like chatbots to respond to customer queries.
The value of the generative AI market will increase by $180 billion in the next eight years.
Research by Brainy Insights estimates that the revenue generated from generative AI services will hit $188 billion by 2032, driven by increased AI adoption across all industries and the desire by businesses to leverage data for decision-making.
80 percent of women are employed in fields vulnerable to automation by generative AI.
Many jobs will be affected by automation, but when more than 25% of the functions of your role can be automated, your role is classified as vulnerable, according to research by the Kenan Institute. It finds that women are disproportionately affected by this, with just 58 percent of men working in similarly vulnerable roles.
89.2% of artists believe that current copyright laws are inadequate in the age of generative AI
This comes from research by the job site Book An Artist, which found that the vast majority of artists it spoke to don’t think that current laws protect them from having their work exploited by generative AI. It’s an area that we can expect to see addressed by lawmakers in the near future, as several lawsuits are already being brought by writers and artists who claim AI providers have effectively stolen their work.
Marketers believe generative AI will save them an average of five hours of work per week.
This works out to over a month in a year! Most commonly, they believe that AI will help by taking over “busy work” while allowing them to focus on more strategic aspects of their job. The Salesforce survey Generative AI Snapshot found that 55 percent of those working in marketing are already using generative AI, with another 22 percent planning on adopting it in the near future.
90 percent of online content could be generated by AI by the end of next year
According to a report by the European Union Law Enforcement Agency, 90 percent of online content could be synthetically generated by 2026. It predicts this will lead to new law enforcement challenges around disinformation, propaganda, fraud and deception.

The view from the expertsThe rise of artificial intelligence is making workers nervous — but it could help themILLUSTRATION BY NINA KRAUSELinda DalySunday January 28 2024, 12.01am GMT, The Sunday TimesGordon Smith, a self- employed business content writer, has a suspicion that he has lost some clients to a relatively new competitor in the market: generative ­artificial intelligence (AI). “My brother-in-law, who works in software, is convinced that AI is coming for my job,” he says. Smith should not be overly worried about business drying up. Content ­writers do not appear on a list recently produced by the World Economic Forum showing the top ten fastest-declining jobs. That honour went to bank clerks, cashiers, legal secretaries and bookkeepers, many of whom are seeing their roles being replaced by AI. Increasingly, artificial intelligence is being seen as a disruptor. Tech companies, keen to forge a path in the emerging world, are restructuring, sometimes making thousands of ­redundancies as they shift their focus to the new ­technology. Last week SAP, a German software firm, announced a €2 billion restructuring programme in which 8,000 roles would be affected through voluntary redundancies or reskilling for AI roles. The company said it expected generative AI to alter its business fundamentally. AdvertisementConversely, AI is driving the revenues of some of the world’s biggest companies. Microsoft’s ascension into the $3 trillion valuation bracket last week was put down to its focus on artificial intelligence. A report published this month by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) found that almost 40 per cent of the global workforce is exposed to AI. SAP, the German software firm, says it expects generative AI to alter its business fundamentallyBENOIT TESSIER/REUTERSLast year, McKinsey, a management consulting firm, predicted that by 2030 “up to 30 per cent of hours currently worked across the US economy could be automated — a trend accelerated by generative AI”. The emergence of generative AI into the marketplace has sparked an international debate and countless studies about whether AI will be the destroyer of millions of jobs. Brad Mallard, chief technology officer at the digital transformation company ­Version 1, called this “scaremongering”. “There’s a lot of doom and gloom and I don’t necessarily buy into it. The key word is not redundancies, the key word is impact,” he said. AdvertisementVersion 1 has been running AI initiatives for up to two dozen of its clients. However, no customer has indicated that the AI would replace human workers, according to Mallard. “A lot of them are relatively small projects­, testing the ­technology to see if it will make a difference,” he said. The Irish government has also waded into the AI debate. John McCarthy, chief economist at the Department of Finance, told a recent Institute of Public Administration conference that the emerging technology carried a “risk of large job losses in some sectors”.However, at a panel discussion at the World Economic Forum in Davos this month, Leo Varadkar, the ­taoiseach, said AI could be a ­significant job creator. “History tells us that any time there’s technological advancement, ­people believe it will eliminate jobs,” he said. “What usually happens is jobs change, and some jobs become obsolete and new forms of employment are ­created.”Varadkar’s views seem to be in line with the general view of experts and the market. A survey last year by the World Economic Forum found that of companies expecting to adopt AI, half expected jobs to be created as a result, while a quarter expected job reductions. Research by the Organisation for ­Economic Co-operation and Development in 2023 showed that job reorganisation was more prevalent than job displacement.At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Leo Varadkar, the ­taoiseach, said AI could be a ­significant job creatorGIAN EHRENZELLER/EPAAdvertisementBobby Healy, the tech entrepreneur behind drone delivery company Manna, sees AI as a “massive job creator”. “When we consider the impact of AI on jobs, we only have to let history guide us. Across time, the industrial revolution, the internet, smartphones, renewable energy and — of course — drones for logistics have all massively increased the productivity of the human race,” Healy said.Cian Ó Maidín of NearForm, the company behind the Covid tracking app, also believes AI will create jobs. “AI is great at taking repetitive manual tasks and ­making them far easier, such as searching for flights, transcribing data or doing research on a topic online. It is an efficiency optimiser, so if a job comprises spending all day transcribing data manually, then yes, eventually these jobs will become ­irrelevant.” Where bodies such as McKinsey and the International Monetary Fund differ­ in their view is where those displaced­ jobs are likely to be. The IMF has said that unlike previous revolutions, which mostly affected ­lower-skilled and middle-skilled jobs, AI could affect high-skilled roles. In ­addition, it has said that advanced economies face greater risks from AI than emerging economies. McKinsey says people in the lowest wage categories are up to ten times more likely to change occupations — not just jobs — by the end of the decade.AdvertisementFor now, many Irish business leaders are unconcerned about job displacement — though one might imagine that they would welcome a reduction in wage bills. At a recent AI conference held by the legal firm Mason Hayes & Curran, a survey of the 500 in attendance found that while half of them said quality and accuracy were the biggest risks with using generative AI, only 8 per cent said job displacement was a concern. Brian McElligott, partner and head of AI at Mason Hayes & Curran, said that it was not a case of “roles being replaced but tasks within roles being replaced”. “When I started my career in ­intellectual property, I did trademark searches. These days a lot of software does that job,” he said. “The benefit to the client is they get things quicker, more standardised, more formalised.” McElligott also sees AI as a net job ­creator. The World Economic Forum has predicted a 40 per cent increase in the number of AI and machine learning specialists­ by 2027.Trayc Keevans, global foreign direct investment manager at the recruitment firm Morgan McKinley, has witnessed an increase in demand for AI developers and engineers, AI ethicists­ and robotics specialists. “AI displaces­ those roles that can be automated such as certain accounting and bookkeeping roles and telemarketers,” she said. AdvertisementColm O’Cuinneain, general manager for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Greenhouse Software, which provides recruitment software as a service, said AI “must be used as an assistance to and not a replacement of humans”.In November Greenhouse published the results of a survey of 1,700 HR managers and found that nine in ten of them were using AI tools in their HR departments. While 44 per cent of respondents said that AI would make hiring decisions for humans in the future, 47 per cent said that they could not fully trust AI hiring tools. “That being said, AI makes recruiters more effective. Our approach is to focus on empowering recruiters with AI tools while at the same time keeping human oversight,” O’Cuinneain said.At Davos, Varadkar held an event attended by Sam ­Altman, the boss of OpenAI. The ChatGPT developer has set up an office in ­Ireland. Lawrence Vesey, a partner in the digital transformation practice at consulting firm Sia Partners, said OpenAI’s arrival could pave the way for more AI firms to set up here. “It is likely to attract technology talent from across the wider tech sector to ­Ireland,” he added. Erik O’Donovan, head of digital economy policy at Ibec, the business lobby group, wants the government to take a “strategic approach to addressing the immediate skills needs of Irish business including digital and AI skills”.“There will be new businesses arising based directly on AI — some of which we can’t anticipate at the moment. So AI will create jobs,” he said.The government published its national artificial intelligence strategy in 2021, aimed at building AI skills and attracting and retaining talent in the field. Mark Jordan, chief strategy officer of Skillnet Ireland, said that there had been a “lot of progress made in terms of skill provision to address AI”. “There’s a number of certification ­programmes, leading all the way up to graduate programmes dedicated to AI,” he said. Technological University Dublin, for example, has introduced a degree in computing with machine learning and AI. A new six-month AI accelerator programme for start-ups at University College Dublin will support entrepreneurs who are developing disruptive AI solutions for a global market, and will offer mentoring, networking events and access to a co-working space. The utopian view of the big AI replacement is that workers will have more time to do more meaningful tasks — or, even better, do less work. In November a study by Autonomy, a think tank, found that more than a quarter of the working population in the UK and US could benefit from productivity gains provided by AI and see their working week reduce from 40 to 32 hours — while maintaining their pay. Barry O’Sullivan, director of the Insight Centre for Data Analytics at University College Cork and a member of the ­government’s AI advisory council, said administrations must learn from mistakes of the past, such as when automation was introduced in the 1970s in the US. “What happened there was there was lots of profitability but the worker didn’t benefit from it very much,” he said.“Over the many years since, great disaffection has been created in society because of that. We have to make sure in the context of AI that the technology is something that raises all boats.”Unions are wary. Niall Shanahan, communications officer with the public union Forsa, said “any AI application is only as good as the human being who gives it direction”. “If AI was to be deployed in any part of the public sector it would have to be absolutely fit for purpose. There would have to be a judgment made as to what degree it will replace roles,” Shanahan added. Many commentators say generative AI, in particular, has at least a decade to go before it is good enough to do the role of humans. This month the parcel company DPD disabled its AI online chatbot after a ­customer made the bot swear and write a poem criticising the company.Last week the radio presenter Dave Fanning launched defamation proceedings against a Hong Kong news site and Microsoft over the publication of his photo alongside an article stating that a different Irish broadcaster had gone on trial for alleged sexual misconduct. ­Fanning’s lawyers told the court that they believed his photo might have been chosen by an AI program. Gordon Smith argues that companies replacing human copywriters for AI tools such as ChatGPT are “saying goodbye to originality”. “I urge them to read the copy that AI produces and realise it is a reheated mash-up of ideas that belongs to someone else and there is nothing terribly original about it,” he said.WorldRelated articlesTHE BIG QUESTIONShould workers replaced by AI get compensation?November 30 2023, 12.00pm GMTLily Russell-Jones | Mick Whitley | Gali ArnonLEADING ARTICLEYear of AIDecember 27 2023, 9.00pm GMTThe Times Leading ArticleJAMES MARRIOTTWhen AI kills jobs, expect a white-collar revoltMay 17 2023, 5.00pm BSTJames MarriottSponsored",https://schema.org,NewsArticle,https://www.thetimes.com/world/ireland-world/article/will-ai-take-my-job-expert-view-artificial-intelligence-explained-9zfpf3knd,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fmethode%2Ftimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2Ffaf7dfae-01d8-4f75-b4be-7bd46f647275.jpg?crop=1498%2C843%2C0%2C0&resize=1200', 'caption': None}","[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Linda Daly', 'jobTitle': 'Business reporter, Sunday Times Ireland', 'sameAs': ['https://www.thetimes.com/profile/linda-daly', 'https://twitter.com/LindaDaly19']}]","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'The Sunday Times', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject'}}",Will AI take my job?

Generative AI can assist with document processing and classification for a wide range of matters, including due diligence, document and contract review, compliance, contract management, knowledge management and deal analysis.By automating these tasks using intelligent technology, significant workflow benefits can be achieved, particularly with improved efficiency and productivity as well as greater accuracy.The use of AI at law firms has transitioned from a mere desire to an essential requirement. It is changing the way we do business, much the same way as email did in the 1990s. As digital transformation continues to advance, AI will become ubiquitous and an indispensable assistant to practically every attorney and legal professional, freeing up time for tasks that add greater value such as thinking and advising.“Legal generative AI is supposed to augment what a lawyer does. It’s not going to do legal reasoning, not going to door case strategy. What it’s supposed to do is do repeatable rote tasks much more quickly and efficiently.”– Zach Warren, Manager, Technology and Innovation, Thomson Reuters Institute  White paperGenerative AI for legal professionals: What to know and what to do right nowAccess white paper  AI for faster data synthesis and analysisCreating, reviewing and sending various documents forms a large part of an attorney’s daily tasks. While important, these are repetitive and manual processes and are typically prone to human error, which can introduce an unnecessary element of risk. AI tools  backed by expert human oversight give you a competitive edge by improving accuracy and thus reducing risk.  With the power of AI in your legal tech tools, you can sort files rapidly and seamlessly without needing to manually examine them. The range of assistance offered by legal-focused generative AI improves the legal firm’s or department’s output by facilitating the legal professional’s ability to apply their higher-level expertise to the work at hand. Efficient legal research and draftingConsider the value of AI-enhanced legal research technology.Generative AI provides a jumpstart on legal research by reducing the time legal professionals must spend shifting through and summarizing content. These tools can produce in moments an informative version of research that would have previously taken hours or days. Learn more about AI-Assisted Research on Westlaw Precision with CoCounsel Lawyers can then apply their expertise to refining the results to ensure that the research output is high quality, thorough, and accurate.  “For any of the tasks that lawyers do on a regular basis or that administrative professionals supporting the legal industry do on a regular basis, this technology allows them to do those things faster and to create a starting point much earlier in the process.”—Zena Applebaum, Global VP, Product Marketing for Research Products for Thomson Reuters Streamlined M&A due diligenceM&A due diligence is a tedious task that limits your time and ability to innovate and creatively problem-solve.Using AI tools for analysis and review of documents saves time and allows you to focus on more valuable pursuits, which facilitates enhanced creativity and allows you to focus exclusively on the tasks that only a person can handle – the job you were trained to do and the job you are passionate about. Improved knowledge managementGenerative AI can help legal teams stay organized and share information via cross-functional tools. Better and faster methods of saving, indexing, identifying, and disseminating lawyers’ prior work and collective expertise helps legal firms and departments solve legal and business problems more effectively. Enhanced onboarding and learningLegal-focused generative AI tools help users get up to speed quickly without extensive training, whether they are new to a firm or gaining knowledge about an unfamiliar area of law.These tools also help users learn new skills in a hands-on way as they work, reducing the need for as many formalized skill-development interventions, saving time and money. Plain-language prompting to navigate complexityThose unfamiliar with a given area of law may struggle to know where to start or which language is most applicable in searching for resources.Generative AI tools that can be prompted using plain-language queries allow users to access faster answers to complicated legal questions, and rapidly organize information and precedent that can help them develop successful arguments.  Ask Practical Law AIQuickly get answers to your questions from the trusted sources Practical Law is known forRequest free demo  Trustworthy security and privacyA professional tool licensed to a particular institution or firm provides a far more secure work ecosystem than a public-facing tool with few or no data controls. While legal professionals must always use caution regarding what data they use with AI tools, they can input a range of proprietary data with far less risk in a professional, licensed tool.Additionally, since legal-specific generative AI tools are trained on high-quality legal content, legal organizations can be confident that their output will be more trustworthy and accurate than other large language models.Originally published August 30, 2023. AI @ Thomson ReutersMonthly e-newsletter for insights and updatesStay up to date  Facebook   Twitter   Linkedin   Email Artificial IntelligenceCollaborationEfficiencyTechnology",http://schema.org,Organization,https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en,,,,,,,,Thomson Reuters Legal,,,,,,https://play.vidyard.com/PphDwBYVYhT5ToE1tHVnaE.jpg,,,,PphDwBYVYhT5ToE1tHVnaE,"(upbeat music)

RichardsonSupported bySKIP ADVERTISEMENTShare full articleRead in appBy Stephen MarcheStephen Marche is the author, most recently, of “The Last Election,” a political thriller written with Andrew Yang.Jan. 31, 2024Much of the current discourse about artificial intelligence sucks. A.I. is one of those subjects that seem to appear out of nowhere, blotting out everything else — like the sun rising over the desert — and a mixture of ludicrous hype and vacuous panic has rushed in to shade the blinding dazzle. A.I. is going to transform every industry, or it’s going to end the world, or both, and you need to know which now. Meanwhile, accurate answers to basic questions — What even is it? How does it work? Where did it come from? Where is it going? — tend to be tucked away in dry technical language that borders on the incomprehensible.Before the launch of ChatGPT, a little more than a year ago, it was difficult to get readers to care about A.I. Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, would tell anybody who would listen that A.I. needed regulation, but few in power were listening. Editors sniffed. Readers yawned.After the launch of ChatGPT, everybody had an opinion, and nobody knew what they were talking about. The novelty and the urgency provoked the usual grift that accompanies any glut of public ignorance. The movies, with their predilection for wild visions of the artificial intelligence future (A.I. will start nuclear war, enslave humanity or teach us the nature of love), didn’t help. And, after a decade during which Silicon Valley has demonstrated that it lacks any sense of social responsibility, it has become impossible to trust the creators of A.I. Then there is the confounding nature of the technology itself, which often eludes the understanding even of the people who invented it. It’s amazing that anything good about A.I. ever gets written.Such books tend to come in two principal flavors: “We’re all going to die” and “How to get rich.” You can easily judge them by their covers. Ignore them. The good news is that there are some terrific books about A.I. once you weed out the grifters.ImageThe Alignment Problem, by Brian Christian (2020)If you’re going to read one book on artificial intelligence, this is the one. Though it was published in 2020, which in terms of A.I. is practically prehistory, I still think it’s fairer and more illuminating than almost anything published since. Its chief value is its close examination of the computer scientists, cognitive psychologists and philosophers who were present at its birth. You just can’t beat dense reporting.The problem with A.I. isn’t that it’s going to end the world, Christian says. The problem is determining how to “align” machine behavior with human values, a conundrum we have been trying and mostly failing to solve since the invention of the cotton gin. “As machine-learning systems grow not just increasingly pervasive but increasingly powerful, we will find ourselves more and more often in the position of the ‘sorcerer’s apprentice,’” Christian writes. “We conjure a force, autonomous but totally compliant, give it a set of instructions, then scramble like mad to stop it once we realize our instructions are imprecise or incomplete — lest we get, in some clever, horrible way, precisely what we asked for.”Christian, the author of two previous books about the intersection of humans and computers, is admirably clear: The trouble isn’t only the machines; it’s the people. To align machines with human values, we have to know what human values are, and that knowledge is hazy at best. We cling to theories of fairness and transparency, which grow vaguer and vaguer when we try to put them into practice. While Christian is hopeful — this is a book that celebrates A.I. as a victory for scientific progress and doubles as a manifesto for A.I. safety — he is also realistic. “Alignment will be messy,” he concludes. “How could it be otherwise?”ImageArtificial Intelligence, by Melanie Mitchell (2019)This is the Honda Civic of A.I. books; I mean that as a compliment. It’s reliable, it’s durable; it gets you where you need to go without a lot of fuss. Its author, a professor now at the Santa Fe Institute, is a longtime specialist in computer science and complex systems; the number of people who have worked in A.I. and can string together a coherent sentence is perishingly small, which is one reason her book is so useful.“Artificial Intelligence: A Guide for Thinking Humans” provides the necessary history of the development of the technology, from the psychologist Frank Rosenblatt and his perceptron (a simple neural network) in the 1950s to the Stanford computer scientist Fei-Fei Li and her ImageNet (a landmark visual database used for training intelligent machines). The story Mitchell tells is chronological and detailed, encompassing the intellectual breakthroughs of the Dartmouth College group that coined the term artificial intelligence in the mid-1950s as well as the advent of natural processing language in the 2010s. She answers essential questions about artificial intelligence simply and elegantly.Moreover, Mitchell doesn’t hide the confusion that any honest encounter with artificial intelligence occasions. “The field of A.I. is in turmoil,” she writes. “Either a huge amount of progress has been made, or almost none at all. Either we are within spitting distance of ‘true’ A.I., or it is centuries away. A.I. will solve all our problems, put us all out of a job, destroy the human race or cheapen our humanity.” That’s not the simplistic take you’ll find on the opinion pages, but after reading Mitchell’s guide, you’ll know what you don’t know and what other people don’t know, even though they claim to know it. And that’s invaluable.ImageThe Algorithm, by Hilke Schellmann (2024)Terrible title, right? I mean, at this point a book called “The Algorithm” could be about anything. I imagine the title is so vague because the book’s subject might seem unappealing on its face. What could be drearier than a book about the use of artificial intelligence by human resource departments? But if you want to know the nitty-gritty of the alignment problem — how people are actually responding to it — “The Algorithm” is the best available case study.Human resources makes an excellent point of entry into the problems of artificial intelligence, because it involves so many different practices: hiring, evaluating, surveilling and retaining employees. The theoretical benefits of A.I. are obvious: increasing efficiency and reducing human bias. Equally obvious are the potential abuses. Schellmann, an investigative reporter and journalism professor, describes both, searchingly and steadily. The great strength of her book is that it treats A.I. as a tool used by people, avoiding grand theories and wild speculations in favor of close attention to detail.She begins her investigation with a great deal of hope for this new technology, given how inept human beings are at dealing with people. “I was so excited when I started this journey researching A.I. in the world of work,” she writes. “‘Finally,’ I thought, ‘a solution to biased human hiring.’” By the end, however, her enthusiasm had waned: “At least some of the tools people and companies use to make employment decisions do not work. At least some companies are basing high-stakes employment decisions on biased and junk algorithms, which cause real harm and prevent qualified people from getting jobs.” Human beings aren’t very good at making decisions in the first place, but A.I. does not liberate us from our human limitations; it chains us to them.The nightmares Schellmann describes — the use of facial recognition software in hiring decisions and the drive toward total employee surveillance — are more chilling than any apocalyptic scenario because they are actually happening. At times, “The Algorithm” reminded me of a digital version of Charlie Chaplin’s ordeal in “Modern Times,” with our minds rather than our bodies pulled and twisted through elaborate gears.ImageProgressive Capitalism, by Ro Khanna (2022)The alignment problem is fundamentally political. Any meaningful response to artificial intelligence will have to be collective. But who will the collective be? The idea that Silicon Valley can self-regulate is by now a sick joke, yet the American government doesn’t seem much better positioned to do the job. Fortunately, Khanna, a Democrat representing California’s 17th Congressional District, offers some hints of what a serious political response to A.I. might look like.“Progressive Capitalism” is a book written by a politician, and therefore filled with the politician’s standard scenes (visits to coal mining towns you’ve never heard of) and rhetorical devices (digestible five-point plans about issues of unimaginable complexity). But if you skip over the filler, Khanna offers one of the strongest prescriptions around for how to deal with the economic and social upheaval inevitable in a transition to new technologies. “While we allowed the internet to emerge without a strong ethical or legal framework in place, we should not make the same mistake when it comes to the emergence of artificial intelligence,” he writes. He cites a PricewaterhouseCoopers report that concludes that by 2030, A.I. will add over $15 trillion to the global G.D.P., but notes that almost all that value will go to a sliver of the population. (At the moment, he adds, only 0.0006 percent of venture capital in the United States goes to Black women.)Khanna proposes “technology hubs” in the Midwest and South to spread the benefits — by supporting research and career training — while remaining pro-growth. He is particularly strong on preventing data discrimination, potentially the most socially disruptive element of artificial intelligence. “Ultimately, there must be clear rules that impose liability on institutions that use personal data in discriminatory ways or that rely on algorithms that further disparities based on race, gender or other demographic considerations,” he writes. Without such protections, algorithms will exacerbate the human failings that already pervade the tech industry.These days, almost nobody turns to American political institutions to figure out what’s going on or what to do about it. Trust in Congress is in collapse, and even at the best of times its members have demonstrated a limited understanding of technological change. (Remember Senator Ted Stevens’s description of the internet as “a series of tubes”?) But Khanna knows what he’s talking about, and it’s comforting to realize there’s at least one person in Congress who does.ImageAI 2041, by Kai-Fu Lee and Chen Qiufan (2021)Anyone who writes about artificial intelligence has to speculate; it’s the nature of the subject. But A.I. has a way of humiliating predictions. (In 2018, Lee predicted Chinese domination of the field, which the advent of ChatGPT instantly disproved.) But it’s too fun not to speculate, and “AI 2041” is self-aware fun.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTLee, a Taiwanese-born, American-educated venture capitalist who is a prominent figure in China’s A.I. scene and a former president of Google China, provides the intellectual foundation for the book, but he was smart enough to join forces with a proper writer, Chen, a leading author of realistic science fiction, to articulate the visions of the future. Each chapter consists of a story by Chen followed by explanations of key concepts by Lee. The approach separates fantasy from verifiable information, which serves both sides well. The nonfiction isn’t lying. The fiction is backed up by facts.The range of the speculation is impressive, too, spanning continents as well as technologies. A Nigerian video producer generates deep fakes. Korean orphans learn from cartoonish A.I. tutors. In Sri Lanka, autonomous vehicles have unintended consequences. Lee's commentary tackles whichever technological innovation has inspired the story: computer vision, natural language processing, bitcoin security, etc.In other books, explanations of the mechanics of artificial intelligence tend to be either drearily technical or childishly reductive; “AI 2041” has found a clever way of avoiding both dangers. In recognizing that the deeper consequences of the A.I. revolution are fundamentally unknowable, it upholds Amara’s Law: “We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.”There is so much more to artificial intelligence than the fear and greed that have dominated the discussion so far. Artificial intelligence is magical, mysterious and profound — and not at all easy to understand. The more definitive or absolute a writer purports to be, the less you should trust their work.These five books have the necessary humility to deal with the glamorous uncertainties. And they all uncover the strangest aspect of A.I.: Its problems are people problems. This is the ultimate irony of the new technology. The true gift of A.I. may be what it reveals about human limitations and failings, not those of machines.A version of this article appears in print on Feb. 18, 2024, Page 12 of the Sunday Book Review with the headline: The 5 Best Books About Artificial Intelligence.

						Generative AI Will Save  Us, Not Destroy Us

Comments 















During the past year, generative artificial intelligence (AI) has taken the world by storm, with enthusiasts projecting that it will solve everything from world hunger to climate change, and detractors warning that it threatens humanity’s very existence—and probably your job. But what exactly is generative AI? In his new book, Generative Artificial Intelligence: What Everyone Needs to Know (Oxford University Press, Feb.), Silicon Valley veteran Jerry Kaplan explores the vast potential—and risks—of a tool that enables us to tap into the accumulated wisdom of humankind.Kaplan, an entrepreneur and inventor, teaches at Stanford University about the social and economic impacts of artificial intelligence. In his book, he explains why generative AI is a completely different animal.“Just a few years ago, most AI systems were tuned for specific tasks, such as recognizing pictures of cats or steering a car,” Kaplan says. “Generative AI is quite different, in that it’s much more general. The same system that can draft a college essay can compose a sonnet, explain how to change a flat tire on a car, plan a Thanksgiving meal, or offer love advice. It can also diagnose medical conditions, write a legal brief, summarize documents and meetings, and perform many other tasks that previously required human expertise and intelligence. This is a major advance that will yield innumerable benefits for society.”It also creates many new risks. “Any technology this powerful is potentially very dangerous in the wrong hands,” he says. “Authoritarians can use it to spread disinformation and suppress dissent; frightening new weapons will change the nature of war; and criminals can use it to steal, cheat, and swindle people on a previously unimaginable scale.” Kaplan is encouraged by the extensive work on creating protocols and procedures to mitigate these risks. In his own life, he has developed precautions, such as establishing a “safe word” with his wife to authentic each other and protect themselves from voice clones asking for, say, banking PINs.And he has good news: The robots aren’t plotting against us. Generative AI systems can seem human—for example, they can show empathy or lie to cover up their mistakes. “But they are not nascent beings with their own independent thoughts, feelings, and desires,” Kaplan says. “We don’t have to worry about them rising up and taking over, because they don’t want anything. There is no ‘they,’ so ‘they’ are not coming for ‘us.’ A robotic generative AI is not going to suddenly wake up, realize it’s being exploited, inexplicably grow its own goals, take over the world, and possibly wipe out humanity, as you often see in movies.”Well, that’s a relief! But what about our jobs? On this front, Kaplan advises readers to see generative AI as a career-enhancing tool, rather than a threat to their livelihoods. For example, as he wrote the book, Kaplan used generative AI as a copy editor that could suggest illuminating analogies or interesting turns of phrase. He also used it to create a short summary to begin each chapter, as he discloses in the book. He sees publishers using generative AI throughout the acquisition and production process—for example, to compare and contrast new book proposals with a publisher’s entire catalog. It will also help us manage our daily lives. Kaplan sees many of us using generative AI as a personal assistant that can renew driver's licenses, prepare travel itineraries, draft wedding toasts, and even tackle sticky interpersonal situations like dodging social obligations. “Your electronic agent will be at your service without judgment or disdain,” he says.Navigating this new world requires adopting a new mindset about what machines can do. “As during the Copernican revolution, when we accepted the idea that we weren’t at the center of the universe, we need to get comfortable with sharing our world with highly intelligent and perceptive machines,” he says. “I, for one, am looking forward to it!”

More than half of UK university students have used generative artificial intelligence to help them with their studies, a survey suggests.A poll of 1,250 undergraduate students through the Ucas admissions service suggests that 53 per cent of students have used generative AI to help them prepare assessments.Of these students, the most popular use is as an “AI private tutor” with 36 per cent reporting that they used AI to explain concepts to them.Other popular uses of AI include suggesting ideas for research and summarising articles, the report found.More than one in eight undergraduate students (13 per cent) said they have used AI to generate text for assessment but they edited the content themselves before submitting it, according to the report from the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) think tank.

The rise of generative AI tools - such as ChatGPT and Google Bard - has sparked concerns about cheating among students in the education sector.But the report by Hepi suggests that only 5 per cent of students surveyed admitted incorporating AI-generated text into assessments without editing it personally.The study, which was carried out in partnership with EdTech company Kortext, suggests a “digital divide” in AI use may be emerging.The survey, which was carried out in November 2023, found that nearly three fifths of students (58 per cent) from the most privileged backgrounds reported using generative AI to help prepare assessments, compared with just over half (51 per cent) from the least privileged backgrounds.Those with Asian ethnic backgrounds are also much more likely to have used generative AI than white or black students, and male students use it more than female students.The report calls on institutions to provide AI tools for those who cannot afford them - when they have been identified as benefiting learning - to prevent the “digital divide” from growing,It adds that institutions should develop clear policies on what AI use is acceptable and what is unacceptable.Nearly two in three students believe their institution has a “clear” policy on AI use (63 per cent) and their institution could spot work produced by AI (65 per cent), the survey suggests.Josh Freeman, policy manager at Hepi and author of the report, said: “Students trust institutions to spot the use of AI tools and they feel staff understand how AI works.

“As a result, rather than having AI chatbots write their essays, students are using AI in more limited ways: to help them study but not to do all the work.“However, action is urgently needed to stop a new ‘digital divide’ from growing. “AI tools are still new and often unknown. For every student who uses generative AI every day, there is another who has never opened ChatGPT or Google Bard, which gives some students a huge advantage.“The divide will only grow larger as generative AI tools become more powerful. “Rather than merely adopting a punitive approach, institutions should educate students in the effective use of generative AI - and be prepared to provide AI tools where they can aid learning.”A spokesman for Universities UK said: “The findings in this study highlight the importance of crystal-clear policies surrounding the use of AI and we know universities are increasingly focusing on this.“The potential risks and benefits posed by AI to higher education have been known to the sector for some time, and any new developments are closely monitored.“Currently, all universities have codes of conduct that include severe penalties for students found to be submitting work that is not their own and engage with students from day one to underline the implications of cheating and how it can be avoided.”

Artificial intelligence (AI) will revolutionise our lives, and while AI may take some jobs, it will also create thousands of careers.
Thanks to the notoriety of ChatGPT, the concept of artificial intelligence is no longer some sort of abstract notion. While AI has been used quietly in the background on most social platforms, it is now accessible to everyone. From writing code to CVs and everything in between, people are using AI to make their lives easier. 
Many tech visionaries believe AI will have the same impact as the internet, smartphones and the mobile web. Rather than taking a Luddite approach and writing off the benefits that AI can bring to life, now is the time to adopt the technology – including work.
Along with machine learning, artificial intelligence is one of the fastest-growing fields in technology, and there are plenty of exciting career opportunities for those looking to future-proof their career. There are predictions that AI will create 97 million new jobs by 2025 – and many businesses are struggling to find qualified people that can create, train and maintain AI and ML systems. 
For those considering a career change, we’ve curated a handful of roles within AI that will be in high demand in the coming years. While these roles do require previous knowledge of computer science and maths, online courses and new certifications in the field are popping up just as quickly as tech advances. 
So if you are thinking about reskilling yourself for a career in artificial intelligence, consider these exciting opportunities.

There is little doubt that the emergence of generative artificial intelligence models will massively disrupt the future of the entertainment industry. This week, a new report outlined just how devastating the impact of Generative AI (GenAI) could be to artists over the next three years.
The report (downloadable here as a PDF) warns that GenAI “signifies a large-scale transition from existing techniques into new processes” and it will “likely rebalance the demand for labor and capital across the entertainment industries.”
For creative workers, this means they will be “facing an era of disruption, defined by the consolidation of some job roles, the replacement of existing job roles with new ones, and the elimination of many jobs entirely.” 
The survey was conducted by consulting firm CVL Economics and co-commissioned by The Animation Guild IATSE Local 839, the Concept Art Association, the Human Artistry Campaign, and the National Cartoonists Society Foundation. It polled 300 bosses from six entertainment industries, including C-suite executives, senior executives, and mid-level managers. It was conducted between November 17 and December 22, 2023.
GenAI Is Not A Future Technology – It Is Here Today
Easily the most alarming takeaway from the study: GenAI is not a hypothetical technology that could impact film, gaming, and vfx artists at some distant date in the future. It is available right now and it is upending the entertainment industry today. In fact, two-thirds of the 300 business leaders who were surveyed expect GenAI to play a role in consolidating or replacing existing job titles in the coming three years (2024-2026).
An estimated 204,000 entertainment industry jobs will be significantly disrupted by generative AI over the next three years. This figure doesn’t include freelancer and contract workers, so the actual number of disrupted jobs is likely to be even greater than the scope of the survey. (The report considers a job disrupted when a sufficient number of tasks are either “consolidated, replaced, or eliminated by GenAI.”)

Of the 204,000 affected jobs, 118,500 of them are in the film, television, and animation industries, which represents 21.4% of the 555,000 jobs in the three areas. An additional 52,400 disrupted jobs are in the gaming industry, representing 13.4% of the 390,500 employed in the sector. 
The most affected state is California, the hub of the American entertainment industry, which will see 62,000 creative jobs impacted, followed by New York (26,000 jobs) and Georgia (7,800 jobs).
How Open Are Entertainment Companies To Using AI?
Entertainment executives are literally frothing at the mouth to start implementing GenAI into their pipelines. Ninety-nine per cent of the people who took the survey said they plan to implement AI in the next three years. In fact, a quarter of companies surveyed indicated that they already had one or more GenAI program(s) in place, while 15% said they had concerns about GenAI programs and would only implement once those issues were resolved. 
One percent of the survey takers said they weren’t planning to use GenAI within the next three years. 
Who’ll Be Affected First?
Certain jobs in the animation and vfx industries will be more impacted than others. For example, among the one-quarter of companies that have already implemented GenAI programs, 44% of them are using the tech to assist in generating 3d models while 39% are generating character and environment design tasks. 

Further, 33% of the survey takers predict that 3d modelers will be affected in the next three years, while 25% believed that compositors were vulnerable over the same time period. Only 15% said that storyboarders, animators, illustrators, and look/surface/material artists woulds experience job displacement by 2026.  
Equally revealing is how entertainment firms are planning to use GenAI. Nearly half of respondents (47%) expect to use it for developing 3D assets, while 38% will use it for 2d concept art and storyboards.  Thirty-five percent want to use it for creating animated characters (synthetic actors, in their terminology) for film/tv, while 31% want to use it for writing scripts. 

More Takeaways And Conclusion
For its part, The Animation Guild issued a list of key findings from the report that included some eyebrow-raising responses:

Three-fourths of respondents said that GenAI tools, software, and/or models have already supported the elimination, reduction, or consolidation of jobs in their business division.
Over 90% of respondents believe GenAI will play a larger role in the entertainment industry, though only 26% of surveytakers felt that their company was fully prepared for the integration of GenAI into their workflows.

The report ends with this suggestion for entertainment industry decision-makers:
The future is not yet written, and it needn’t be generated by AI. It is important to remember that GenAI output is constrained by its inputs. If the responsibility to generate content shifts away from humans to machines, which can currently only formulate output based on previously created content, the availability and uniqueness of new content brought into the world will become more limited. It is critical that those in leadership positions, especially in entertainment industries, keep this top of mind and ideate on ways that new technologies can expand human creativity, not replace it

(Michael Dwyer / Associated Press)       By Christi CarrasStaff Writer    Jan. 30, 2024 9 AM PT      Share       Share via Close extra sharing options    Email     Facebook    X    LinkedIn    Threads    Reddit    WhatsApp    Copy Link URLCopied!   Print        An estimated 62,000 entertainment jobs in California spanning film, TV, music and gaming will be disrupted by the rise of artificial intelligence within the next three years, a new study says.Published Monday, the report further estimates that 204,000 entertainment jobs across the United States will be  affected by AI during the same time frame. A job is considered disrupted when a significant amount of tasks within that role are consolidated, replaced or eliminated as a result of AI, the study explains.Consulting firm CVL Economics surveyed 300 entertainment-industry leaders — including C-Suite executives, senior executives and mid-level managers and producers — for the study, which analyzes the impact and implications of generative AI usage in the business. The report was commissioned by the Animation Guild, the Concept Art Assn., the Human Artistry Campaign and the National Cartoonists Society Foundation. Advertisement    After a number of Animation Guild members expressed concerns about the threat of AI, the union intends to use the results of this study to inform its bargaining strategy and goals, said Brandon Jarratt, who serves on the Animation Guild’s executive board and AI task force. The data is a window into the attitudes and intentions of the most powerful people in the industry when it comes to AI, which Jarratt hopes will prove invaluable — “especially when it comes to shoring up our own contract language around technological change.”“The tool itself is almost never the issue,” Jarratt said. “The studios are always looking for ways to spend less money. And if they feel like they’re going to be able to cut budgets in order to meet shareholder projections or whatever, then they’re going to try to exploit that in any way they can — and that’s where the fear comes from.”            Hollywood Inc.   Actors and writers aren’t the only ones worried about AI, new polling shows  Concerns about AI are central to the current Writers Guild and SAG-AFTRA strikes, but Americans in other industries also are worried, according to a new poll for the Los Angeles Times.Aug. 6, 2023          Business   These filmmakers use AI. And they’re not ashamed to admit it  In Culver City, a gathering of indie filmmakers who used AI software to make short films takes place amid a broader Hollywood reckoning with automation.Nov. 7, 2023  In an industry already brought to its knees by the COVID-19 pandemic, overspending during the streaming wars, overlapping labor disputes and mass layoff-inducing corporate mergers, AI is just one more wrench to worry about for entertainment workers.The growing prevalence of AI has recently emerged as a source of tension in Hollywood, especially during last year’s writers’ and actors’ strikes, which culminated with the WGA and SAG-AFTRA securing limitations and protections surrounding the use of the modern technology in their contracts with the studios. However, those surveyed expressed less concern about the potential fallout for writers and actors than for other crafts. Adam Fowler, founding partner of CVL Economics, suspects that the gains made by writers and actors in those contracts influenced  what kinds of jobs survey participants viewed as susceptible to AI. Advertisement    “In terms of the specific jobs and roles that we ended up talking about in the report, questions about acting and writing were really much lower overall,” Fowler observed.According to the study, the job tasks most likely to be impacted by AI in the film and TV industry are 3-D modeling, character and environment design, voice generation and cloning and compositing, followed by sound design, tools programming, script writing, animation and rigging, concept art/visual development and light/texture generation. About a third of respondents predicted that AI would displace 3-D modelers, sound editors, re-recording mixers and broadcast, audio and video technicians by 2026, while a quarter expected sound designers, compositors and graphic designers to be affected as well. Only 15% flagged storyboard artists, illustrators, animators and look, surface and material artists as vulnerable to AI.“I was really surprised at the 3-D modeling being so high,” said Nicole Hendrix, co-founder of the Concept Art Assn., who called the results of the study “chilling.”“There’s obviously so much talk in the news about ChatGPT and programs like Stable Diffusion, so we were expecting to see anything with those platforms the most disrupted,” added Concept Art Assn.  co-founder Rachel Meinerding. “It was interesting to see some of these other positions that we thought were maybe a little further away from being displaced be so high up.”        Awards   Strikes, streaming and AI: Hollywood executives debate the issues that defined a wild 2023  The Times spoke to Nicole Brown of TriStar Pictures; Sam Register of Warner Bros. Animation; Jonathan Glickman of Panoramic Media Co.; Roy Lee of Vertigo Entertainment; FredAnthony Smith of SMAC Entertainment and Chris Hart of United Talent AgencyJan. 2, 2024  In the music and sound-recording industry, the tasks most likely to be affected by AI are voice generation and cloning, music generation and recording and lyrics composition,  followed by mastering, mixing and tools programming, according to the study.More than 50% of survey participants anticipated that AI would displace sound designers in the next three years, while more than 40% saw AI coming for music editors, audio technicians and sound engineers. Roughly a third of respondents predicted a similar fate for songwriters, composers and studio engineers.Meanwhile in the gaming industry, 3-D modeling and concept art/visual developing are the tasks most vulnerable to AI, followed by character and environment design, sound design, tools programming and voice generation and cloning, the report states.About a third of the industry leaders surveyed said that software developers, sound editors, special effects artists and software analysts and testers were at risk of AI displacement, while 20% thought 3-D artists, game designers, UI/UX designers and video game testers would be displaced.        Hollywood Inc.   Is AI the future of Hollywood? How the hype squares with reality  At SXSW, the annual summit of tech boosters, all eyes turned to A.I. — and, in particular, what the emerging sector means for entertainment.March 18, 2023  Overall, the study concludes that entry-level positions in the entertainment industry will be disproportionately impacted by the ascent of AI — a detail that particularly worries Hendrix.“When you’re looking at any technology that’s essentially replacing [or consolidating] a junior or entry-level role ... it is harming the ecosystem,” she said. “What does that mean if nobody’s really entering in and the bar is now this immovable wall?”Furthermore, the report identifies 72% of the entertainment companies surveyed as early adopters of generative AI, while 75% of respondents reported that AI had already facilitated the elimination, reduction or consolidation of jobs in their business division.         Entertainment & Arts   AI is Hollywood’s ‘Napster 2001 moment,’ entertainment lawyers warn   Actors fear artificial intelligence will replace them. Entertainment lawyers predict the future is more complicated than that.July 11, 2023  Though most survey participants noted that AI has also created and will continue to create new job opportunities, it’s unclear whether those new jobs will be accessible to workers displaced by the technology.“It’s not like the [workers in] roles that are consolidated and lost are going to be automatically eligible for those new roles,” Hendrix explained. “Those are different skill sets. It’s not ... a one-to-one conversion.”Jarratt, a technical director at Disney Animation, said he isn’t looking to dismiss AI “wholesale.” He believes there are ways that AI can be used to improve working conditions and allow animation staffers to focus on the more rewarding, artistic aspects of their jobs by eliminating some of the more rote tasks,  such as manually painting a brick texture on a wall.Ultimately, Jarratt said the Animation Guild hopes to “help set the industry standard for what kind of tools are appropriate and ... going to help artists, and which ones are going to hurt them and hurt their livelihoods.”   More to Read               Video game performers move closer to strike as SAG-AFTRA negotiations stall over AI   2 hours ago                What’s in the new IATSE deal?

Leon and other, human officers focused on the metaverse - an immersive digital reality where people can interact with one another - quickly became an endangered species.Executives spearheading metaverse efforts at Walt Disney Co., Procter & Gamble Co. and Creative Artists Agency left. Leon's LinkedIn profile (yes, he had one), no longer exists, and there's no mention of him on the company's website, other than his introductory press release. Publicis Groupe declined to comment on the record.Instead, businesses are scrambling to appoint AI leaders, with Accenture and GE HealthCare making recent hires. A few metaverse executives have even reinvented themselves as AI experts, deftly switching from one hot technology to the next. Compensation packages average well above $1 million, according to a survey from executive-search and leadership advisory firm Heidrick & Struggles. Last week, Publicis said it would invest 300 million euros ($327 million) over the next three years on artificial intelligence technology and talent.""It's been a long time since I have had a conversation with a client about the metaverse,"" said Fawad Bajwa, the global AI practice leader at the Russell Reynolds Associates executive search and advisory firm. ""The metaverse might still be there, but it's a lonely place.""The C-suite reshuffle illustrates the fickle nature of technology trends - and the difficulty corporations face distinguishing hype from reality.Most companies have largely moved on from the metaverse. The word was uttered just twice on earnings calls at S&P 500 businesses last quarter, compared with 63 times in 2022's first quarter, according to Bloomberg transcript data. That year, eight out of ten CEOs said they were either hiring dedicated talent with expertise in the space or expanding the responsibilities of their leadership teams to cover it, according to Russell Reynolds. All were chasing a piece of a global business opportunity that McKinsey & Co. consultants at the time optimistically estimated could be worth $5 trillion by 2030.Apple's decision to refer to its new mixed-reality headset Vision Pro as a ""spatial computing"" device, with no meta-mentions whatsoever, is another sign that ""the focus has definitely shifted,"" according to Nada Usina, chief executive officer and co-founder of NU Advisory Partners, an executive search and advisory firm focused on boards and the c-suite. Microsoft Corp. this month overtook Apple as the world's most valuable public company, largely thanks to investors' enthusiasm for its aggressive investment in AI. Even Meta's Zuckerberg - who once proclaimed the metaverse ""the next frontier"" - has recently focused instead on generative AI after spending billions on metaverse initiatives that have borne little fruit.All that has left some meta-mavens seeking new pastures or rejiggering their roles. Joanna Popper, CAA's chief metaverse officer, left the talent agency after just over a year and then served a stint as a ""board observer"" at entertainment-focused AI startup Metaphysic.ai, which has a partnership with CAA. (Popper did not respond to a request for comment.) Pratik Thakar, who spearheaded Coca-Cola's metaverse efforts with its interactive ""Real Magic"" marketing campaign in 2021, is now global head of generative AI for the beverage giant.But not every metaverse guru can follow suit. The skill sets of artificial intelligence leaders ""are quite different,"" Bajwa said. ""You don't just want to repurpose somebody. You will not get the deep expertise you want.""At least one metaverse executive fell victim to a corporate coup. Disney's Michael White left after Bob Iger returned to run the Mouse House and axed White's metaverse department amid a broader overhaul. He's now chief product officer at the self-driving car business Zoox, owned by Amazon.com Inc. Typically, there's less palace intrigue: P&G's Ioana Matei quietly left the Pampers maker last summer and is now running innovation at a global agricultural firm. White did not respond to Bloomberg interview requests, and Matei declined to comment.Some metaverse chiefs remain, including Yaiza Rubio at Spanish telecom Telefonica and Nelly Mensah at LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE. But their expertise spans several emerging technologies, such as digital ledger blockchain. And even companies that want to explore the metaverse's uses may opt for a consultant now, said Aliceson Robinson with Heidrick & Struggles. ""There is still interest in engaging with consumers in the metaverse, but not as a C-suite hire,"" said Robinson, the executive search firm's global sector leader for consumer, technology, entertainment and media.Jeff Wong, global chief innovation officer at professional services giant Ernst & Young LLP, said his department has probably halved its metaverse investment over the past year or so. ""Some folks are making a joke out of it, like it's done and dusted,"" he said, although he's not one of them. ""There's a ton of promise in what the metaverse can deliver,"" Wong said.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com

Risks come in many forms – consistency, compliance, security, and infringement. The last threat, infringement, is on the minds of many leaders. What if the model builder trains its model on content to which it does not have sufficient IP rights? And what if the model generates content that is seemingly distinct and substantially different from the original work?

Indeed, many content creators are pursuing legal action against Generative AI providers. In 2023, artists Sarah Andersen, Kelly McKernan, and Karla Ortiz filed a class action lawsuit alleging that Stability AI used their copyrighted work without their permission in training Stable Diffusion. Later last year, a judge issued a written decision dismissing all but one claim for direct copyright infringement on behalf of just one plaintiff but provided the plaintiffs with leave to amend the dismissed claims. Stock photo provider Getty Images has also sued Stability AI, accusing it of misusing more than 12 million Getty photos to train its Stable Diffusion AI image-generation system. On Dec 27, 2023, The New York Times sued Microsoft and OpenAI in a copyright infringement complaint that alleges the companies used the newspaper’s content to train large language models. In early January, two nonfiction book authors filed a class-action complaint against Microsoft and Open AI, alleging that they “simply stole” their work. These complaints may take a while to clear the legal system, and the first lawsuit above may indicate how the judges will rule in future cases.


While the resolution of these claims is unclear, are there any ways to mitigate risk in the interim? For example, one simple way of reducing the copyright infringement risk is for end users to avoid making specific references to known and famous works, authors, or painters when drafting prompts. While such prompt engineering may not eliminate the risk, it reduces the likelihood that the generated output would resample a copyright-protected work.

Here are a few other tactics that various organizations have proposed.

They simply indemnify you
PROMOTED
When sued for copyright infringement, Microsoft indemnifies commercial customers of its Copilot tools, which provide generative AI assistance as part of Office, GitHub, and other products. Microsoft calls this the Customer Copyright Commitment, and they require that customers implement their guardrails and commitments to qualify. For example, for text generation such as “journalistic content, writing assistance, or other open text generation scenarios,” Microsoft requires specific content filter settings. “The protected material text model must be configured in filter mode. The jailbreak model must be configured in filter mode.” Like Microsoft, OpenAI offers the indemnifying “Copyright Shield,” but requires users to meet some limitations and expectations to qualify for that protection — as do Amazon, Google, and IBM. As Generative AI providers are in a much better position to know the content on which their models are trained, indemnification provides one level of protection to the users. These indemnifications may cover damages and legal costs up to a certain dollar limit. But could the user still be stuck with hefty fees?
They secure sufficient IP rights in the content they use for training or delivery of their models
Generative AI providers use three different approaches to secure the necessary IP rights in the training content. Providers may (i) negotiate with content providers to use copyrighted material, (ii) train the models on material they own, (iii) or pay content providers whenever their content or likeness is used.

Some generative AI providers are trying to negotiate deals with content creators so that content may be used to train models without fear of infringement action. Open AI reportedly had months of negotiations with NYT and others. According to numerous reports, OpenAI has offered between $1 million and $5 million yearly to license copyrighted news articles to train its AI models.

In some instances, content creators — more aptly called content distributors — are building their own generative AI. Getty Images launched Generative AI by iStock for a segment of their customers, including small businesses, designers, and marketers. These generative AI models were trained exclusively using proprietary data from Getty Images’ creative libraries. Getty Images wants its customers to be confident in the content they are generating. Similarly, Adobe launched Adobe Firefly, its generative AI tool trained on Adobe stock images and other licensed content.

As another example, a training company that uses Avatars to deliver training programs hired human actors (most AI avatars are based on real people) with the explicit idea that when a client uses an actor’s likeness to provide training, the actor will get paid for such use.
Will Open Source protect you?
Using open-source models does not limit copyright infringement risk in all instances. AI-generated content produced by open-source models may still be subject to copyright infringement actions. The AI model itself doesn't determine whether the output infringes on anyone’s copyright; instead, the copyright infringement risk arises from the use of copyright-protected content as part of training data and its relationship to model output. But does the risk increase because none of the major players have negotiated agreements with content providers?
Given where we are, what would it take for organizations to use generative AI in content generation? Are the assurances from Big Tech enough, or would organizations want more assurances? Would they naturally limit the scope of their content generation workstreams?

SINGAPORE: Like many other nurses in Southeast Asia, Mr Muhammad Asyraaf bears the brunt of the perennial manpower crunch in the healthcare industry. 
“Nurses have so much to do. We are always running around … and just rushing for time,” said the 25-year-old senior staff nurse, who works in a Singapore hospital.Advertisement 












The shortage of doctors and nurses in the region is well documented. In Java, Indonesia, for example, there are approximately only 22 medical specialists for every 100,000 residents, according to state news agency Antara.
Meanwhile, Thailand reportedly sees up to 7,000 nurse resignations at state-run hospitals annually despite a yearly increase of 10,000 new nursing graduates.
The typical result is a heavier burden for healthcare workers who stay on as they hold the fort.
This is where artificial intelligence (AI) can lighten the load - and it’s already being put into action, be it handling administrative tasks or expediting health screenings.
But even as AI shapes up to be a remedy for the overworked, concern is also growing over its rapid advance. A key worry often voiced is: “Will AI steal our jobs?”Advertisement 












To Mr Asyraaf, the answer is no. “AI can never take over what we're doing because our work as nurses involves feelings; it involves a human touch. These are things that AI can never do,” he stressed.

This sentiment is shared by call centre agents in the Philippines, even as worries mount that generative AI will replace the roughly 1.6 million workers in the wider business process outsourcing (BPO) industry. 
Currently, jobs around the world are enhanced rather than threatened by AI, said Dr Pranpreya Sriwannawit Lundberg - the Director of International Policy Partnership at the Office of National Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation Policy Council (NXPO) in Thailand. 
But this could change by 2040, when the capabilities of AI become equivalent to those of humans, she warned.
“Within these two decades, we have to learn how to live with and utilise AI so that it benefits rather than controls us,” said Dr Lundberg.  Advertisement 












HIGH-TECH HELP FOR HEALTHCARE WORKERS
After more than three years of working as a nurse in the fast-paced general surgical high-dependency unit, Mr Asyraaf told CNA that his compassion in nursing is slowly dwindling. 
He cited the various administrative tasks that nurses must do, such as drafting shift handover notes and writing up patient risk assessments, all taking up time which could be better spent tending to patients.
“There’s no sincerity sometimes when we are doing our work because we are just rushing. There's always no time for us to sit down with the patient and talk to them. I guess that's not a nurse’s role anymore,” said Mr Asyraaf. 
He hopes AI can eventually handle all the administrative and routine tasks, so nurses like him can do more to help patients emotionally and psychologically.
Many AI tools developed for the industry are precisely aimed at taking on such “tedious tasks” so as to ease the heavy workload of health workers, said Dr Feng Mengling, an assistant professor at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health in Singapore.Advertisement 












“(This is) so they can have more time to provide personal care for the patients,” he added.
In the region, healthcare institutions like the Siloam Sri Wijaya Hospital in Palembang, Indonesia and the National Kidney Transplant Institute (NKTI) in Manila, Philippines have incorporated an AI chat assistant in their daily operations.

Dr Romina Danguilan, the Deputy Executive Director for Medical Services at NKTI, told CNA the high-tech tool has replaced about 80 per cent of the work of contacting patients and doing follow-ups in the hospital’s peritoneal dialysis division.
“(Through weekly checkups with patients), the bot has prompts to ask the patients how they're doing and how they're feeling. A lot of manpower has been freed now. 
“The wonderful thing is that the medical personnel can still evaluate by reading through the answers that patients give and act on it if needed,” said Dr Danguilan.

At Siloam Sri Wijaya Hospital, the AI chat assistant does the work of sending out reminders to parents about their babies’ vaccination appointments.
“We have a lot of babies born in the hospital. Probably more than 100 babies in a month so it’s really hard for us to keep track of each and every one of them,” said hospital chief executive officer (CEO) Dr Bona Fernando. 
“In Indonesia, we have a strict vaccination schedule every month for babies (until they are) two years of age. So we just copy that calendar and put it into the AI, (which will then) automatically send the reminders.”

The AI chat assistant in question is the creation of Singapore-based company Bot MD. It’s used by some of the largest public and private hospital and clinic groups globally and in the region, including Singapore General Hospital, Siloam Hospitals, and Philippines General Hospital. 
Another AI tool called FxMammo - created by Singapore-based company FathomX - hopes to address the shortage of radiologists in the region and ease their workload. 
FxMammo utilises AI to detect breast cancer based on mammography images. “Our AI reads (the mammography scans) and tells you … the probability of cancer and exactly where to find it,” said FathomX CEO Stephen Lim. 
He pointed out that AI is desperately needed for radiologists, especially in dealing with breast cancer. 
“For example, for every 100,000 women, Singapore has 6.5 radiologists while Malaysia has 1.9 radiologists. 
“The fact of the matter is that there's not enough radiologists. We need AI to come and help; they are not meant to take over the radiologists,” said Mr Lim. 
With the help of FxMammo to screen the mammograms, the radiologists improved in their detection of breast cancer, he said, leading to about a fifth of time saved on average.

AI NOT SET TO FLATLINE HEALTHCARE CAREERS
Although AI can and has already taken on some tasks of healthcare workers, experts told CNA these workers are not in danger of losing their jobs anytime soon. 
“We are looking at a shortage of healthcare workers globally. This is the phenomenon, rather than physicians and healthcare workers losing their jobs,” said Dr Feng from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.
He added that the COVID-19 pandemic further emphasised the labour crunch. “Even Singapore, a very well-off country, just can’t train or hire enough nurses or doctors for such a crisis.”
In the case of radiologists, Dr Feng told CNA greater demand for them in the region is to be expected in the next 10 years, especially in the face of an ageing population.
“I work with a lot of radiologists and the common feedback is that they are worried their workload is going to increase dramatically and that they won’t be able to handle it anymore.”
“There will be an even greater demand for them (in the future). I just don’t see them being in danger of losing their jobs,” he said. 
FathomX CEO Mr Lim said that while AI can do certain base tasks, it can never surpass a healthcare worker’s know-how, views, passion and critical thinking skills - all of which are crucial to quality nursing and doctoring. 
Similarly, Bot MD founder Ms Koh said AI can never truly replace the art of doctoring. 
“For example, reading a patient’s body language or the subtle cues - these are things (that are) hard for a computer to learn but a doctor can recognise them immediately.  
“We have seen many instances where patients prefer to call or speak to a human doctor or a nurse because that lends more comfort or builds more confidence in trusting the diagnosis or treatment being presented to them,” she told CNA.

WHAT ABOUT CALL CENTRE WORKERS?
While AI looks set to help rather than replace healthcare workers, the same can’t be said for other industries.
In the Philippines, the rise of generative AI has sparked worries that AI chatbots will displace call centre workers.
With generative AI, issues previously encountered - such as the perceived lack of empathy of automated chatbots - are being resolved. 
In May last year, one senator called for an inquiry into the uses of AI and the potential displacement of workers, especially in the BPO and original equipment manufacturing industries. 
Ms Imee Marcos cited an Oxford Economics and Cisco study, which found that digital automation could render approximately 1.1 million jobs in the Philippines obsolete by 2028.
Despite such worries, call centre workers told CNA they are not concerned about AI taking over their jobs, at least in the near future. 
Ms Andie, 33, has been working as a call centre agent for 12 years in the Philippines. She noted that customers still prefer to speak to a live agent instead of an AI chatbot, especially when it comes to more complex issues like billing or technical issues.
“They want a detailed explanation regarding their bills or they want to be walked through on certain technical issues,” explained Ms Andie.

People who are looking to enter the BPO industry are also unfazed by AI.
“As far as I know, the job becomes easier when it is done by chatbots or AI technology,” said Ms Angeline Panerio, 19, who has been job hunting since August last year.
India-based AI chatbot company Haptik said that it views the BPO market “through a lens of complementarity rather than replacement”. 
“AI tools in Haptik's vision are designed to work … with human agents (by) handling routine tasks, thereby allowing human representatives to focus on more complex … interactions that require a personal touch,” said Haptik’s director of growth, Ms Nameer Khan. 
She added that there is also significant potential for collaboration between BPO call centres and enterprise AI assistants like Haptik. 
Ms Khan noted that one possibility is by using generative AI to interpret the customer’s text, tone, and voice in order to analyse real-time customer sentiment and help contact centres identify and address customer concerns. 
BPO firms themselves have also incorporated AI into their businesses. Among them is Concentrix, one of the biggest BPO companies in the Philippines.

Mr Amit Jagga, senior vice president and country leader of Concentrix Philippines, told CNA it uses AI to improve its advisors’ accuracy and productivity as well as to create more personalised and meaningful customer experiences.
He brought up an example where a technology company’s support advisors were struggling to navigate a complex landscape of products.
“We developed a generative AI application in just three weeks that allowed them to swiftly tackle technical queries with AI assistance. 
“Advisor productivity soared by 65 per cent and query response times were slashed by four minutes, resulting in better customer experience as well as substantial cost savings,” he said. 
When asked if Concentrix has had to hire fewer people over the years due to the rise of AI chatbots, Mr Jagga said this was not the case, adding that Concentrix in the Philippines continues to grow. 
“The human touch remains invaluable, especially in complex and emotionally sensitive situations. It is the combination of AI and the human touch that results in superior customer experience,” he said. 
Mr John Maczynski, the co-CEO of BPO advisory firm PITON Global, told CNA that human workers remain invaluable as they can offer empathy, which is something that AI can’t do.
“This human ability to genuinely understand and share the feelings of another person is something AI hasn't been able to achieve. 
“AI might be getting better at many things, but when it comes to the complex, and often messy, world of human emotions and subtleties, it still has a long way to go,” he said.

JOBS COULD BE AT RISK BY 2040: EXPERT 
As it stands, AI does not pose an imminent threat to workers’ livelihoods - at least in Southeast Asia’s healthcare and BPO industries.
But this could change by 2040, one expert warns.
Dr Lundberg noted that the world is currently at the first stage of AI - known as weak AI - where humans have more logic than AI. At this stage, AI is able to enhance the work of human workers and acts as an aid, she said. 
However, at the second stage - known as strong AI - where AI has a human level of cognition, jobs will be at risk. 
“There is already strong prediction that the second stage will arrive in two decades,” said Dr Lundberg.
As AI rapidly evolves, the race for regulation is on, with action being taken at global and national levels to avert the risks while hopefully reaping the rewards.
When asked if the development of AI should be regulated in favour of the livelihoods of human workers, Dr Lundberg noted that while this is an ideal scenario, the rapid growth of AI has outpaced the setting of rules.
“Regulation has to go hand in hand with technological progress but the private sector, where technological progress occurs, will not wait.
“What we could do is to accelerate the government side (so that it catches up with the private sector). We cannot slow down the private sector; it’s opposite from development,” said Dr Lundberg.
To survive in the strong AI phase, workers should also constantly upskill, reskill, and gain basic digital literacy.
For those already proficient with basic technology, they need to focus on upskilling and reskilling, said Dr Lundberg, noting that there are already various government-led initiatives in the region. 
Singapore launched an updated version of its national AI strategy last month. Among its plans - a tripling of its AI talent pool, and significant investments in adult education and training to reskill and upskill workers.
In Thailand, the government has introduced a tax subsidy programme for companies that offer upskilling and reskilling courses.

PITON Global co-CEO Mr Maczynski strongly supports the idea of the government stepping in with measures to build a tech-inclusive workforce in the Philippines.
“Initiatives like tech training programmes, motivating companies to maintain a balance between AI and human staff, and policies that encourage continuous learning and skill development are essential,” he said. 
Meanwhile, Dr Feng noted that many AI applications, like ChatGPT, are relatively accessible and should be used by workers to familiarise themselves with AI. 
“A lot of the solutions are free. Others may (cost) about S$20 a month, so you could just pay … and try it for a month so that you know and experience firsthand how the AI behaves, what it feels like when the AI gets something right or wrong, and how impressive it is. 
“We feel scared of things that are unknown but once you interact with it, then … you are no longer so fearful of the technology,” said Dr Feng. 
He also highly recommends that AI technology be part of the regular curriculum in schools. 
“Some training is required but not to a level where (they should) … suddenly become a programmer (and) start developing AI solutions. 
“I foresee by the time they graduate that it’ll be part of everyone's life,” Dr Feng said.
“It’ll be a common technology that in many scenarios, they will have to use.”
