Crawford had worked at NASA for 15 years and wrote software for Mars rovers. He left NASA to run engineering for Google Books, and while there he noticed that Elon Musk's SpaceX and other new companies were driving down the cost of building and launching satellites. Crawford saw an opportunity to collect and analyze what he anticipated would be a deluge of images from a surfeit of new satellites that would circle the Earth, taking readings and pictures. Orbital Insight's first product looked at images of cornfields all over the world, analyzing the health of plants to predict yields for traders who bet on future price swings.About two years later, Silicon Valley's top investors decided Orbital Insight might be huge. Venture firms pumped $20 million into Crawford's company in June 2016 and then another $50 million in September 2017.That surge of excitement wasn't because Crawford (or investors) suddenly got smarter&mdash;it was because of significant advances in alternative intelligence. ""In 2015, for the first time ever, computers got better at object recognition than humans,"" Crawford has explained. AI can learn to recognize a tree or ship and see patterns amid billions of objects in images and data. Prior to such AI breakthroughs, satellite data were infinitely less useful&mdash;too cumbersome to be analyzed at fast enough speeds by traditional algorithms running on computers. Using AI, all that raw output from satellites can help traders, investors and corporations know things they could never know before and almost as soon as they happen.Early in 2017, Orbital Insight got attention for being able to mix data from various sources to find pirate fishing boats that had gone dark by turning off their radio beacons&mdash;a discovery more useful to maritime law enforcement than business, but a strong proof point for the company's technology. In the fall, Crawford's team relied on data from a new type of satellite technology called synthetic aperture radar to peer through Hurricane Harvey's clouds as the storm hammered Houston. The usual satellite photos, as you might guess, can't see through clouds. Knowing the extent of flooding during the hurricane proved tremendously helpful to insurance companies that would have to settle billions of dollars of claims later. Those two wins&mdash;the pirate ships and Harvey&mdash;helped convince hedge funds and major banks to pay Orbital Insight millions for data sets that might help them learn something about natural resources, the movement of goods or anything else that the competition didn't yet know. ""We've only just begun to uncover a handful of signals, but we've already seen the impact they can have on financial, energy and insurance markets, as well as society as a whole,"" Crawford said in a statement.As Orbital Insight's business has grown, it has been hiring aggressively, looking for data scientists, marketing managers and talent recruiters. But that's only the beginning. Orbital Insight and companies like it are ravenous for raw satellite data, so they are buying it from satellite companies, adding more fuel to the satellite boom. The relatively inexpensive, small satellites that observe conditions on Earth are the fastest-growing segment of the $260.5 billion global satellite industry, the Satellite Industries Association said in a report in July 2017. That's helping create a cascade of jobs, from rocket scientists (of course) down to maintenance workers who sweep launch pads. In December, LinkedIn listed more than 11,084 satellite industry job openings in the U.S.Orbital Insight is just one of a many new companies in an exploding field called alternative data. The market for alternative data was about $200 million in 2016 and is expected to shoot to more than twice that by 2020, according to research firm Tabb Group. Alternative data refers to data outside of mainstream information, such as government statistics, stock prices, company financial reports and consumer credit card transactions. Alternative data comes from sources such as cellphone signals, ""internet of things"" sensors on industrial equipment, online videos, tweets, searches, social media likes&mdash;and satellite images.Making use of all that raw data often means connecting several types of data to get a glimpse of a trend otherwise impossible to spot. AI makes that possible. The alternative data industry could not exist without AI. And an alternative data industry could not exist without humans. At a time when most of the rap against AI is that it will kill jobs, the rise of the alternative data business shows how AI can create jobs nobody even thought of before.Double Data-ingIt's easy to believe artificial intelligence is about to automate away truck drivers, radiologists, accountants, fast-food clerks and just about every kind of manufacturing job and leave the world with just two classes of people: a thin layer of rich geeks on top and then the rest of us&mdash;a giant, grumbling population of families living on government-issued guaranteed incomes and spending our days doing little more than playing with model trains or clicking down YouTube rabbit holes. When Quartz surveyed 1,600 readers this past July, 90 percent agreed that half of today's jobs will be lost to automation in five years&mdash;though in classic human thinking, 91 percent of respondents said other people's jobs will be axed, not their own.In recent months, however, some smart folks in the business world have been arguing that our future isn't so bleak, rolling out study after study showing AI will create many more jobs than it will destroy. A study by tech analyst firm Gartner concluded that by 2020, AI will automate 1.8 million people out of work but will create 2.3 million jobs&mdash;a net gain of 500,000 jobs. Capgemini, a consulting group, released a report saying that 83 percent of companies that implemented AI found that the technology created new jobs. Deloitte, another consulting firm, studied automation in the United Kingdom and found that 800,000 low-skilled jobs were eliminated because of AI, but another 3.5 million positions were created, and those new jobs pay on average $13,000 more per year than the jobs that went poof.Such statistics aren't always comforting in the face of an AI threat that seems so obvious. If we build self-driving trucks, millions of truck drivers will be rendered obsolete. We have dealt with the AI-driven chatbots replacing the human customer-service reps who used to answer our calls about how to buy the right size shoe or fix a finicky cable TV box. Last year, Deloitte did another study showing that within a decade, AI will automate away 39 percent of jobs in the legal sector&mdash;mostly lower-level paralegals and legal secretaries. We are familiar with those kinds of jobs and can easily imagine how people will get hurt if they are replaced by AI.It's harder to imagine industries that don't yet exist and how they will create jobs for all types of workers, not just those who have an innate knack for writing code or designing a computer chip. That's what makes the alternative data industry intriguing now: It is one of the early, emerging industries that has come into being because of AI. (Others range from the business of making computer chips specifically to run AI to a budding field of ""AI ethicists"" who teach AI to behave well.)The investing world awakened to alternative data thanks to an event in April 2016. Foursquare, the location-based social networking app, detected something odd in its data from the 50 million people using its apps to log the places they visited. At the time, the Chipotle restaurant chain was working to bounce back from a 2015 E. coli scare, and it reported that seasonal foot traffic to its restaurants appeared to be getting back to normal. But Foursquare noticed that its users who had previously visited a Chipotle were going to other restaurants instead. The foot traffic was due to promotions that lured in newcomers who just wanted to get a cut-price burrito. That meant Chipotle was losing its loyal customers. Foursquare made note of this in a blog post just before Chipotle reported earnings that showed that sales dropped 30 percent. Suddenly, traders around the world wanted the kind of magic Foursquare possessed.In recent years, the generators of new kinds of raw data have been exploding. We carry cellphones everywhere, creating sometimes-anonymous and sometimes-not data about where we are when we do certain things. Newfangled sensors track industrial parts, air quality, how many steps we walk. The more we do online, the more data our activity generates&mdash;and these days we shop, talk, socialize, bank, work and watch TV on computer or phone screens.A single source of data might result in a narrow insight into people's behavior, but there is exponential value in crossing different kinds of data sets. ""No matter how large your data set, you'll always miss the bigger picture if you're viewing it in isolation,"" Adam Gibbs of alternative data company Enigma tells me. ""The true value of data lies in connecting many pieces together from various sources to create a holistic view.""That's where AI becomes critical. It works somewhat like a research assistant.

I just care that a person with ID 345 used to shop at a Whole Foods but then&mdash;all of a sudden&mdash;an Aldi opens up in your neighborhood, and now I see that person with ID 345 no longer shops there, and I see an Aldi transaction. That means Whole Foods potentially lost a customer.""Such insights can suggest trends stock traders or hedge fund managers can bet on.

Marketers might be able to anticipate your pattern and send you a lunch discount offer the minute you pull into the Home Depot parking lot.All these companies are hiring AI specialists and programmers. They're also looking for people who are not necessarily technologists but know how to ask interesting questions for the AI to check out. Foursquare would never have made hay about the Chipotle data if someone hadn't thought to wonder whether the foot traffic was from new or old customers. An expert in iron ore might know questions to ask AI about the movement of barges to get some insight about whether production globally is up or down.This is all new work&mdash;jobs nobody could've imagined a decade ago, when the iPhone first came out.IoT JobsMany jobs are getting created downstream from the hedge funds and alternative data companies. Look at the activity stirred up by one class of alternative data company that buys enormous amounts of information collected by ""internet of things"" sensors. More than 8 billion connected things are already deployed worldwide, according to Gartner, and that's expected to rise to 20 billion by 2020. Global spending on the IoT is expected to grow nearly 16 percent a year through 2020, when the market will reach $1.3 trillion, according to technology analyst firm IDC. That's a lot of commerce&mdash;and that means a lot of jobs for employees at all levels. Verizon, for instance, needs an army of workers to install IoT sensors in millions of street lamps. Those sensors track noise levels, air quality, the number of cars in parking lots and other factors. Other companies are hiring IoT designers and managers&mdash;retailer Target hired a vice president of IoT last year. Without AI making all that data valuable, little of this would be happening.We are in the midst of an AI-driven data-gathering boom. In business circles, the meme is that ""data is the new oil""&mdash;and finding new data is the new prospecting craze.Which takes us back to satellites. By creating a rich market for satellite data, companies like Orbital Insight fund growth in the business of designing, making, launching and operating satellites. That's given birth to new companies such as Planet&mdash;founded, like Orbital Insight, by former NASA scientists. Planet is making satellites about the size of a footlong sub, and it operates 200 in orbit and raised $183 million in funding. Another young company, PlanetIQ, is working on launching a 12-satellite constellation.Down the satellite food chain, new satellite operators drive business for satellite manufacturers in the United States (Boeing, Orbital ATK, SSL) and overseas (Dhruva Space in India, NanoAvionics in Lithuania). Those manufacturers, in turn, buy from makers of electronics, antennae, solar panels, nuts, bolts and everything else that goes into a satellite. The workers in factories making the nuts and bolts for satellites may not know anything about AI, but AI is a big reason they're employed.It's impossible to count how many downstream jobs are already directly attributable to AI, yet there's no question AI makes data far more valuable than ever&mdash;the way the mechanized loom made cotton more valuable 250 years ago by greatly multiplying what could be produced with cotton.It's true that AI will automate away vast numbers of jobs in coming years. But emerging sectors like alternative data promise to give many more humans something to do more productive than watching Simon's Cat all day.Correction: A previous version of this article referred to Planet as ""Planet Labs.""&nbsp;The company changed its name from Planet Labs to Planet in 2016.

The workers in factories making the nuts and bolts for satellites may not know anything about AI, but AI is a big reason they're employed.It's impossible to count how many downstream jobs are already directly attributable to AI, yet there's no question AI makes data far more valuable than ever—the way the mechanized loom made cotton more valuable 250 years ago by greatly multiplying what could be produced with cotton.It's true that AI will automate away vast numbers of jobs in coming years. But emerging sectors like alternative data promise to give many more humans something to do more productive than watching Simon's Cat all day.Correction: A previous version of this article referred to Planet as ""Planet Labs."" The company changed its name from Planet Labs to Planet in 2016. A past version of this article also misstated the number of satellites Planet operates. It currently operates 200 satellites.

Today Microsoft is releasing a new book, The Future Computed: Artificial Intelligence and its role in society. The two of us have written the foreword for the book, and our teams collaborated to write its contents. As the title suggests, the book provides our perspective on where AI technology is going and the new societal issues it has raised.
On a personal level, our work on the foreword provided an opportunity to step back and think about how much technology has changed our lives over the past two decades and to consider the changes that are likely to come over the next 20 years. In 1998, we both worked at Microsoft, but on opposite sides of the globe. While we lived on separate continents and in quite different cultures, we shared similar experiences and daily routines which were managed by manual planning and movement. Twenty years later, we take for granted the digital world that was once the stuff of science fiction.
Technology – including mobile devices and cloud computing – has fundamentally changed the way we consume news, plan our day, communicate, shop and interact with our family, friends and colleagues. Two decades from now, what will our world look like? At Microsoft, we imagine that artificial intelligence will help us do more with one of our most precious commodities: time. By 2038, personal digital assistants will be trained to anticipate our needs, help manage our schedule, prepare us for meetings, assist as we plan our social lives, reply to and route communications, and drive cars.
Beyond our personal lives, AI will enable breakthrough advances in areas like healthcare, agriculture, education and transportation. It’s already happening in impressive ways.
But as we’ve witnessed over the past 20 years, new technology also inevitably raises complex questions and broad societal concerns. As we look to a future powered by a partnership between computers and humans, it’s important that we address these challenges head on.
How do we ensure that AI is designed and used responsibly? How do we establish ethical principles to protect people? How should we govern its use? And how will AI impact employment and jobs?
To answer these tough questions, technologists will need to work closely with government, academia, business, civil society and other stakeholders. At Microsoft, we’ve identified six ethical principles – fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusivity, transparency, and accountability – to guide the cross-disciplinary development and use of artificial intelligence. The better we understand these or similar issues — and the more technology developers and users can share best practices to address them — the better served the world will be as we contemplate societal rules to govern AI.
We must also pay attention to AI’s impact on workers. What jobs will AI eliminate? What jobs will it create? If there has been one constant over 250 years of technological change, it has been the ongoing impact of technology on jobs — the creation of new jobs, the elimination of existing jobs and the evolution of job tasks and content. This too is certain to continue.
Some key conclusions are emerging.
First, the companies and countries that will fare best in the AI era will be those that embrace these changes rapidly and effectively. This is because new jobs and economic growth will come to those that embrace the technology, not those that resist or delay adopting it.
Second, while we believe that AI will help solve big societal problems, we must look to this future with a critical eye. There will be challenges as well as opportunities. We must address the need for strong ethical principles, the evolution of laws, training for new skills and even labor market reforms. This must all come together if we’re going to make the most of AI.
Third, we need to act with a sense of shared responsibility because AI won’t be created by the tech sector alone. At Microsoft we’re working to democratize AI in a manner that’s similar to how we made  the PC available to everyone. This means we’re creating tools to make it easy for every developer, business and government to build AI-based solutions and accelerate the benefit to society.
All of this leads us to what may be one of the most important conclusions of all. Skilling-up for an AI-powered world involves more than science, technology, engineering and math. As computers behave more like humans, the social sciences and humanities will become even more important. Languages, art, history, economics, ethics, philosophy, psychology and human development courses can teach critical, philosophical and ethics-based skills that will be instrumental in the development and management of AI solutions. If AI is to reach its potential in serving humans, then every engineer will need to learn more about the liberal arts and every liberal arts major will need to learn more about engineering.
While we don’t have a crystal ball that shows us the future, we do know that we’re all going to need to spend more time listening to and learning from each other. We hope that The Future Computed can contribute to this conversation.

Whether the ""robots"" take the form of artificially intelligent (AI) software programs or humanoid machines, research suggests that technology is poised to automate a huge proportion of jobs worldwide, disrupting the global economy and leaving millions unemployed.But just which jobs are on the chopping block is still a subject of debate.Some experts have suggested that autonomous systems will replace us in jobs for which humans are unsuited anyway — those that are dull, dirty, and dangerous. That's already happening. Robots clean nuclear disaster sites and work construction jobs. Desk jobs aren't immune to the robot takeover, however — machines are replacing finance experts, outperforming doctors, and competing with advertising masterminds.The unique demands placed on primary and secondary school teachers make this position different from many other jobs at risk of automation. Students all learn differently, and a good teacher must attempt to deliver lessons in a way that resonates with every child in the classroom. Some students may have behavioral or psychological problems that inhibit or complicate that process. Others may have parents who are too involved, or not involved enough, in their education. Effective teachers must be able to navigate these many hurdles while satisfying often-changing curriculum requirements.In short, the job demands that teachers have nearly superhuman levels of empathy, grit, and organization. Creating robotic teachers that can meet all these demands might be challenging, but in the end, could these AI-enhanced entities solve our most pervasive and systemic issues in education?Room For ImprovementIn 2015, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, a plan for eliminating poverty through sustainable development. One goal listed on the agenda is to ensure everyone in the world has equal access to a quality education. Specific targets include completely free primary and secondary education, access to updated education facilities, and instruction from qualified teachers.Some nations will have a tougher time meeting these goals than others. As of 2014, roughly nine percent of primary school-aged children (ages 5 to 11) weren't in school, according to the same UNESCO report. For lower secondary school-aged children (ages 12 to 14), that percentage jumps to 16 percent. More than 70 percent of out-of-school children live in Southern Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. In the latter region, a majority of the schools aren't equipped with electricity or potable water, and depending on the grade level, between 26 and 56 percent of teachers aren't properly trained.To meet UNESCO's target of equal access to quality education, the world needs a lot more qualified teachers. The organization reports that we must add 20.1 million primary and secondary school teachers to the workforce, while also finding replacements for the 48.6 million expected to leave in the next 13 years due to retirement, the end of a temporary contract, or the desire to pursue a different profession with better pay or better working conditions. That's...a lot of teachers. So it's easy to see the appeal of using a robotic teacher to fill these gaps. Sure, it takes a lot of time and money to automate an entire profession. But after the initial development costs, administrators wouldn't need to worry about paying digital teachers. This saved money could then be used to pay for the needed updates to education facilities or other costs associated with providing all youth with a free education.Digital teachers wouldn't need days off and would never be late for work. Administrators could upload any changes to curricula across an entire fleet of AI instructors, and the systems would never make mistakes. If programmed correctly, they also wouldn't show any biases toward students based on gender, race, socio-economic status, personality preference, or other consideration.But we still have some ways to go before such instructors enter our classrooms.Education systems are ""only as good as the teachers who provide the hands-on schooling,"" UNESCO claims, and today's robots simply can't match human teachers in the quality of education they provide to students. In fact, they won't be able to for at least the next decade, Rose Luckin, a professor at the University College London Knowledge Lab, a research center focused on how digital media can transform education, told Futurism. Teachers rely heavily on social interaction to support their students and figure out what they need, Luckin continued, and so far no digital system can compete with a human in this realm.However, it is possible that no robot will ever be good enough to replace teachers completely. ""I do not believe that any robot can fulfill the wide range of tasks that a human teacher completes on a daily basis, nor do I believe that any robot will develop the vast repertoire of skills and abilities that a human teacher possesses,"" Luckin said.There is some weight to Luckin's assertions. While machines can handle a variety of specific tasks, we haven't yet come close to creating artificial general intelligence (AGI) — the kind of machine that could answer the tough questions outside the purview of the immediate lesson that good teachers should be prepared to tackle. Today's robots also lack the empathy and ability to inspire that teachers bring to the classroom.That doesn't mean robots won't replace teachers, though. Very few studies directly compare human and robot teachers, so it's not clear how much better the human performs than the robot.In any case, Luckin suggests a compromise: AI and automated systems could have collaborative roles in the education system. That would enable teachers and students to take advantage of the tech in ways that will benefit them both, and we wouldn't need to worry about lack of oversight for when our AI systems do encounter problems.AI in Every ClassroomFor teachers, the classroom is anything but serene. Kids giggle during lessons, call out, rustle papers, and fidget — teachers must compete with the chaos to simply get students to learn. And teachers take their jobs home with them, too, spending their evenings and weekends planning lessons and grading student work. What if AI could act as an extra pair of hands in the classroom? That was the idea Luckin and her co-author put forth in a recent paper. This AI assistant could manage tasks such as taking attendance or routine grading. It could also help teachers generate new lessons by autonomously navigating online teaching resources, such as Teachers Pay Teachers, to find the lesson plans most likely to resonate with a classroom based on the details of the students and the school's specific curriculum.Decreasing the workload dumped on teachers would hopefully make them less stressed. This could limit the burnout that has exacerbated the teacher shortage and make the position more appealing to others considering becoming teachers. In her paper, Luckin predicted that every teacher could have a dedicated AI assistant within the next decade. But AI could do more than the drudgery of teaching — it could actually make teachers better by giving them greater insight into their students' needs. Classrooms could be equipped with language processors, speech and gesture recognition technology, eye-tracking, and other physiological sensors to collect and analyze information about each student, Luckin writes. Instead of waiting for a test or a raised hand for a student to display her understanding of the material, teachers could access real-time information that could show them why the student might not be learning at full capacity. They'd know which students weren't getting enough sleep, if they had inadequate diets, if they were suffering from emotional stress — information that can affect a student's performance but that can be difficult to tease out in the classroom.The teacher could use this information to tailor his or her teaching strategies to meet the needs of each individual student. They could simply look at a list generated by the AI to see what each student should work on that day. If a student needed extra one-on-one attention, the teacher could instruct that student to work with an AI-powered Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) that adjusts its approach to match the student's learning style. Meanwhile, the teacher may decide to give other students group work so they could hone their interpersonal skills.The system could also help students modify their behavior to improve their own performance. For example, a student might learn that she scores lower on exams when she stayed up late the night before, drank coffee that morning, or took public transport to school instead of walking. By altering these habits in the future, she could score better on the tests and excel.Image Credit: PixabayAs Luckin told Futurism, the increased use of AI in education could have downsides. Schools will need to guard against the misuse of student data, and cybersecurity will be of the utmost importance. Still, these types of precautions won't be limited to education. Data protection will be a universal concern as the Internet of Things (IoT) grows and our world gets increasingly ""smart.""A few decades in the future, every student and teacher could be the master of their own personal educational analytics, Luckin predicts. That information could be useful beyond the classroom — students may choose to share certain analytics along with their college admission packages, while teachers may include theirs in applications for future employment.Not My ClassroomAs previously noted, it will be a little while before every teacher has an AI assistant and every student has an AI tutor. Developing the necessary technology will be the simple part, Luckin said, and already, some researchers are working on such systems.Convincing parents, teachers, and students to embrace AI in education will be the real challenge. Some may be biased against the technology for fear it will leave them unemployed, while others may have a hard time shaking thoughts of the doomsday scenarios posited by tech luminaries such as Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking.Teachers, in particular, are likely to be more resistant to automation because teaching is an ""inherently human process,"" Terry Heick, founder and director of TeachThought, a publisher of teaching materials and resources that are focused on innovation in education, told Futurism.He said teachers might take the suggestion that a ""symbolically mindless robot"" could do their work as an indication that others see their skillset as easy to duplicate. In fact, said Heick, the opposite is true — teaching is such an ""impossible"" task that anything that could make the job easier on teachers should be valued. To ease this resistance, researchers and tech companies could involve educators, parents, and students in the development of AI systems designed for the classroom, as Luckin suggests in her paper. Stakeholders could see that their input and experience is valuable; they could even identify weaknesses in systems under development. Researchers can tailor systems to suit the needs of educators, students, and parents, improving the final product. Skeptics could see how AI could improve the learning experience.For this process to go well, it needs to be slow and iterative. It will likely take decades at best.""Considering that education still hasn’t embraced mobile technology, the idea of Johnny 5 circling around a classroom teaching students in just a decade seems far-fetched,"" Heick said.

Speaking to Recode’s Kara Swisher and MSNBC’s Ari Melber, Pichai said AI is “one of the most important things that humanity is working on. It’s more profound than, I don’t know, electricity or fire,” adding that people learned to harness fire for the benefits of humanity, but also needed to overcome its downsides, too. Pichai also said that AI could be used to help solve climate change issues, or to cure cancer. 

The remarks from the chief executive of Google, which is largely perceived as one of the world leaders in the development of artificial intelligence, came after Swisher asked repeatedly about AI’s impact on jobs and observed that Silicon Valley tends to have a “shiny happy future” outlook about disruptive technologies. 

“I get that shiny happy future, but, jobs,” Swisher said. “Look at a job like a radiologist. You might not need lawyers, which some people might celebrate... you might not need accountants.” Pichai acknowledged that people have a right to be concerned, but still need to embrace technological advances. “History shows that countries that pull back don’t do well with change.

Speaking to Recode’s Kara Swisher and MSNBC’s Ari Melber, Pichai said AI is “one of the most important things that humanity is working on. It’s more profound than, I don’t know, electricity or fire,” adding that people learned to harness fire for the benefits of humanity, but also needed to overcome its downsides, too. Pichai also said that AI could be used to help solve climate change issues, or to cure cancer. The remarks from the chief executive of Google, which is largely perceived as one of the world leaders in the development of artificial intelligence, came after Swisher asked repeatedly about AI’s impact on jobs and observed that Silicon Valley tends to have a “shiny happy future” outlook about disruptive technologies. “I get that shiny happy future, but, jobs,” Swisher said. “Look at a job like a radiologist. You might not need lawyers, which some people might celebrate... you might not need accountants.” Pichai acknowledged that people have a right to be concerned, but still need to embrace technological advances. “History shows that countries that pull back don’t do well with change. So you have to embrace the change,” he responded. The full interview with Pichai and YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki will air next Friday, January 26, at 10PM ET, on MSNBC.

Artificial intelligence can beat humans at games such as Jeopardy, chess and Go, but these much-celebrated achievements aren’t actually what we need. We want AI to work with us not against us – and the key may be a little banter.
Jacob Crandall at Brigham Young University in Utah and his colleagues created an algorithm capable of learning to cooperate with people that uses short snippets of conversation known as “cheap talk”.
By including chit-chat, the team doubled the rate of cooperation between humans and AI across 472 games. These games were two-player…

It’s 2038 and — like most businesses these days — a tech company is using artificial intelligence to scan job applicants. The system was trained with public employment records, an ostensibly unbiased dataset.
But even 20 years after sex-based discrimination was thrust into the media spotlight, the tech industry still hasn’t fully corrected its gender imbalance. The job screening system “learns” that most software engineers are men and starts favoring male candidates over women.
This dangerous scenario is one of many posited in “The Future Computed,” a new book published by Microsoft, with a foreword by Brad Smith, Microsoft president and chief legal officer, and Harry Shum, executive vice president of Microsoft’s Artificial Intelligence and Research group.
The book examines the use cases and potential dangers of AI technology, which will soon be integrated into many of the systems people use everyday. Microsoft believes AI should be developed with six core principles: “fair, reliable and safe, private and secure, inclusive, transparent, and accountable.”
Nimble policymaking and strong ethical guidelines are essential to ensuring AI doesn’t threaten equity or security, Microsoft says. In other words, we need to start planning now to avoid a scenario like the one facing the imaginary tech company looking for software engineers.
Microsoft suggests governments lead the way in establishing best practices for AI by integrating the technology into systems that serve the public. “While enabling more effective delivery of services for citizens, this will also provide governments with firsthand experience in developing best practices to address the ethical principles identified,” the book says.

Microsoft also suggests governments invest in better ways to make data public without connecting that data to individuals. AI relies on data — and large public datasets can be a useful tool in training the technology — but only if personal identifying information is protected.
“Additional research to enhance ‘de-identification’ techniques and ongoing discussions about how to balance the risks of re-identification against the social benefits will be important,” the book says.
But, Microsoft warns, governments shouldn’t go overboard. The book says regulators should avoid “rigid approaches” because not all personal information is equally sensitive and AI needs some identifying data, such as public health records, to achieve societal benefits.
Competitiveness is also a concern. AI needs data to learn and the keepers of the largest datasets in the world are a small handful of tech companies, Microsoft included. The book’s authors suggest government data as an antidote to this concern, allowing challengers to the Big Tech incumbents to feed their data-hungry AI systems.
Brad Smith, Microsoft president and chief legal officer, and Harry Shum, executive vice president of Microsoft’s Artificial Intelligence and Research group, wrote the foreword to ‘The Future Computed.’ (Microsoft Photo)
“The question of the availability of data will arise most directly when one firm seeks to buy another and competition authorities need to consider whether the combined firms would possess datasets that are so valuable and unique that no other firms can compete effectively,” Microsoft says in the book.
Microsoft’s recommendations boil down to an ethical code, designed to ensure governments and technologists recognize the risks associated with AI and build the technology with safeguards in mind.
“In computer science, will concerns about the impact of AI mean that the study of ethics will become a requirement for computer programmers and researchers? We believe that’s a safe bet,” write Smith and Shum in the book’s foreword. “Could we see a Hippocratic Oath for coders like we have for doctors? That could make sense.”
The book is available to download starting tonight, and will be released in the coming weeks on Amazon Kindle.

The students’ training is part of an agreement signed by Oracle and the Higher Colleges of Technology on Sunday to prepare young UAE nationals youth for the country’s future jobs. Oracle is also discussing with the university ways to develop AI-related degrees. “We're focusing on research and development in technology as well as providing the necessary support and training for local youth,” said Omar Al Olama, Minister of Artificial Intelligence, at the launch in Dubai. “Most importantly, we are focusing on utilising emerging technologies in public services to enhance day-to-day experiences of UAE citizens and increase the efficiency of the government and private sectors. We hope to see the positive effects of these technologies in the coming years.” According to a report by the United Nations last year, almost 65 per cent of current primary school pupils will one day work in a job that does not yet exist. And last month the US research company Gartner predicted that AI will generate 2.3 million in 2020 alone, outstripping the 1.8 million is is expected to eliminate. While jobs such as driving vehicles are likely to go, managerial jobs, including processing the huge amounts of data being collected from people today, will need to be created.  “That’s a good indication that the world is changing and AI completely changes the way in which we operate,” said Abdul Rahman Al Thehaiban, senior vice president in technology for the Middle East and Africa at Oracle. ""We are in an era of evolution and we anticipate a heavy adoption to AI. According to our studies, almost a third of all cloud customers are taking into consideration AI as part of their requirement.""<br/> Recent speculation has led many to think AI will mean less dependency on human capital. “But it’s completely the contrary,” he said. “We believe that [AI will mean] more focus of human capital into more innovation rather than just standard work. Its objective is for people to spend more time on creativity and innovation.” ____________ <strong>Read more</strong>   ____________<br/> As such, the company launched the Zayed Innovation Hub on Sunday – the first of its kind in the region - to attract and create the most promising ideas and applications that will shape the future. “The Zayed Innovation Hub represents a milestone in the Artificial Intelligence space, not only in the UAE but also in the region and to position the UAE as a global leader in AI,” Mr Al Olama said at the launch. “We expect this initiative to encourage other technology companies to emulate Oracle in supporting and training students and the Emirati youth.” From the government to the private sector, residents and students, the hub’s aim is to invest in local talent. “AI impacts all fields,” he said. “In the UAE, we are focusing on facing the future to ensure advancements of humanity.” The hub will not only be dedicated to the UAE or the region, but to eastern central Europe, the Middle East and Africa, which includes around 140 countries. “It is not just a normal hub,” Mr Al Thehaiban said. “It is fully dedicated to AI which gives us more of an obligation to ensure that we become part of the journey the UAE is transforming [into]. There have been many changes in IT and with the recent cloud engagement, this has been the fastest adoption across the world.” It will be open for all government users, private sector and students for any creative ideas. “But making AI easy to adopt is critical – a key challenge for organisations is that they can’t afford to wait,” he said. “So the hub will aim to address this challenge by engaging with key UAE audiences by raising their awareness levels, helping drive an innovative approach and also supporting the skills development of the next generation of Emirati leaders.” This year’s World Government Summit, which kicks off in Dubai next month, will introduce a Global Forum for Governance on AI for the first time. “The questions which the whole world is asking are whether AI is good or bad for humanity and if there is a risk for AI to have a higher ability to think and take decisions on behalf of human beings,” said Mohammed Al Gargawi, Minister of Cabinet Affairs and the Future. “There are two schools of thought. One says that 47 per cent of jobs will disappear in the coming 10 years and another says that with every new industrial revolution, jobs are lost. ""The industrial revolution will create new job opportunities so here, we are discussing a virtual topic, but life with AI will be richer as humans will have more time to innovate, create and think about new ideas and sectors.” Experts say AI will reshape and improve the experience of tourism, healthcare, residents, education and businesses across the UAE, with studies showing that businesses using AI will steal up to 1.2 trillion dollars per year from their less-informed peers by 2020. “The success of strategic government initiatives like Smart Dubai and Expo 2020 is underpinned by emerging digital technologies like AI driving the creation of an automated infrastructure for the realisation of these projects”, said Arun Khehar, senior vice president of business applications in the Eastern and Central Europe, Middle East, Africa at Oracle. “The hub will serve as the ultimate platform for driving awareness, experimentation and implementation of AI in the UAE, and the opening of a state of the art Digital Hub in Dubai has now employed more than 400 cloud sales professionals.”",https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/OSSOPMXWQXG2MLLIMHWKGHZFTI.jpg?smart=true&auth=548d043b2054cf5726745dc64b2bc578cac56b621b9e72a1c8b4ad3b8c29e780&width=400&height=225,"[{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/SJFY44DRYRCEWDSW7T6M6CYXU4.jpg?smart=true&auth=304552e032ca4265ee83eaeab1928206c8dd371f2ea37f8afcea95326caec556&width=800&height=450', 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/SJFY44DRYRCEWDSW7T6M6CYXU4.jpg?smart=true&auth=304552e032ca4265ee83eaeab1928206c8dd371f2ea37f8afcea95326caec556&width=400&height=225', 'width': 800}, {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/OSSOPMXWQXG2MLLIMHWKGHZFTI.jpg?smart=true&auth=548d043b2054cf5726745dc64b2bc578cac56b621b9e72a1c8b4ad3b8c29e780&width=800&height=450', 'width': 800}]",,Government,"[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Caline Malek'}]",,,N/A,N/A,"The first 500 Emirati men and women will soon start their training in artificial intelligence as the UAE looks to begin shaping its future in a field that is expected to soon touch every company and individual on the planet.The students’ training is part of an agreement signed by Oracle and the Higher Colleges of Technology on Sunday to prepare young UAE nationals youth for the country’s future jobs.Oracle is also discussing with the university ways to develop AI-related degrees.“We're focusing on research and development in technology as well as providing the necessary support and training for local youth,” said Omar Al Olama, Minister of Artificial Intelligence, at the launch in Dubai.“Most importantly, we are focusing on utilising emerging technologies in public services to enhance day-to-day experiences of UAE citizens and increase the efficiency of the government and private sectors. We hope to see the positive effects of these technologies in the coming years.”According to a report by the United Nations last year, almost 65 per cent of current primary school pupils will one day work in a job that does not yet exist.And last month the US research company Gartner predicted that AI will generate 2.3 million in 2020 alone, outstripping the 1.8 million is is expected to eliminate. While jobs such as driving vehicles are likely to go, managerial jobs, including processing the huge amounts of data being collected from people today, will need to be created.An attendee tries out an application on the Pepper humanoid robot at SoftBank Robot World 2017 in Tokyo on November 21. Artificial intelligence will remove the need for many jobs in the service industry, it is predicted, but is expected to create more in high-tech roles that involve managing and utilising data. Kiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg“That’s a good indication that the world is changing and AI completely changes the way in which we operate,” said Abdul Rahman Al Thehaiban, senior vice president in technology for the Middle East and Africa at Oracle.""We are in an era of evolution and we anticipate a heavy adoption to AI. According to our studies, almost a third of all cloud customers are taking into consideration AI as part of their requirement."" Recent speculation has led many to think AI will mean less dependency on human capital.“But it’s completely the contrary,” he said. “We believe that [AI will mean] more focus of human capital into more innovation rather than just standard work.

CMU Experts Lead Conversations at World Economic Forum

By Laura Kelly Email




A contingent of Carnegie Mellon University faculty, led by Interim President Farnam Jahanian, engaged in conversations about how big data and artificial intelligence are changing the world at the 2018 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland last week.
This year's theme, ""Creating a Shared Future in a Fractured World,"" aimed to rededicate international leaders from across industries and disciplines to develop a shared narrative to improve the world.
""Carnegie Mellon is proud to have demonstrated our distinct expertise at the nexus of technology, business and human life at the World Economic Forum in Davos this year,"" Jahanian said. ""Our outstanding faculty presenters and panelists showed the global community that we not only pursue solutions to the world's most critical challenges, but we are also passionately committed to fostering access and broad societal inclusion in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, a theme of this year's events.""


Among those innovators and scholars were faculty members Rita Singh, Marios Savvides and Jean Yang, who collaborated for an IdeasLab presentation, ""Ultra-Biometrics and Cybersecurity with Carnegie Mellon University.""


Singh, an associate research professor in the Machine Learning for Signal Processing Group, discussed her research, which allows for the pinpointing of people and insights into their biological makeup and surroundings through voice recognition.

Jean Yang, an assistant professor in the School of Computer Science, shared her research in encoding privacy frameworks and how to make them accessible to all. One of the pillars of her research that was discussed during the IdeasLabs was increasing security.
""Software is running more and more of our lives,"" Yang said. ""It's deciding everything from where we eat to who we date to what disease we get diagnosed with to how it gets treated.""

Illah Nourbakhsh, a professor in the Robotics Institute at CMU, discussed how to meet the needs of all within a growing global trade, geospatial technology, autonomous drones, and how to address global hunger and food security as a panelist at the Forum. Former Vice President Al Gore delivered the closing remarks of the session.
Again this year, the CREATE Lab at the Robotics Institute's billboard-sized EarthTime display was a popular draw among Forum attendees.
Justine Cassell, a professor in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute, gave solo presentations, ""Governing Advanced Technologies: Machine Learning"" and ""Global Tech, Local Solutions: Artificial Intelligence."" In ""Machine Learning,"" Cassell addressed how machine learning will soon be used everywhere and discussed what first principles should shape its governance. In ""Artificial Intelligence,"" closing the gaps in access to information and smart algorithms were discussed.


In addition to IdeasLab, Singh, Savvides and Yang delivered solo presentations throughout the conference.
Formal talks are only a part of the Davos experience. Participants said informal interactions are an important part such as an extended conversation between CMU Trustee and CEO of Cognizant Francisco D'Souza, President Jahanian and musician will.i.am.
CMU also hosted a reception attended by many Davos participants including U.S. Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta.
