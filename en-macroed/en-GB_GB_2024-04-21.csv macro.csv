Generative artificial intelligence (AI) describes algorithms that can be used to produce new content, including audio, code, images, text, simulations, and videos. It is developing all the time and is now being used as a support mechanism for all kinds of content-based creations. 



Employers in all sectors are seeing an increase in candidates using AI tools (for example, ChatGPT) to help them complete job application forms. Essentially, this involves putting application questions into an AI tool and then copying the answers it supplies into the application form, either word-for-word or with some minor edits. Why does it matter? AI-generated job applications can often be generic, impersonal and may not accurately reflect an applicant's qualifications, knowledge, skills, and experiences. There is also a risk that it can generate false or misleading information. Job applications contain questions where candidates are reasonably expected to do some research (normally using an online search engine) before answering. The difference in using a search engine is that an individual has enough understanding to interpret the responses received. When AI is used, the search results will be automatically interpreted to provide an answer, and therefore an individual doesn’t require any understanding of the topic at all. This will be problematic if the candidate is selected to progress to a later stage of the recruitment process when realistically they are unsuitable for the role.




What are the indicators that AI has been used?If multiple applicants have provided the same answer either word-for-word, similar, or in a different order or tweaked, it is likely that AI has been used. Other strong indicators can be found within written responses such as:stilted, impersonal language (robotic sounding or plain) inconsistency in the language, writing style or tone of voice throughout the over-use of semi colonsoverly long or complex sentences that have a range of unusual vocabulary, patterns or phrases.




Can employers know for certain?Currently there is no official marketed technology to detect AI. If an employer’s organisation has access to an AI app they could put the questions in there and see what response is supplied. Employers could also consider using screening software that is designed to detect/identify AI generated content, however, the accuracy of these tools is questionable and not verifiable. 




What should employers do if they are sure that a candidate has used AI to complete an application?Employers should consider all factors before making a decision. It may depend on the number and type of question(s) that AI has been used to answer. If an employer still believes the individual is a suitable candidate, it is recommended that they have a verbal discussion with them to check they have the required understanding and knowledge in order for their application to be taken forward. If the candidate is allowed to progress employers must ensure there are robust and thorough assessment methods to further test the knowledge and skills required for the post.




Is there anything employers can do to deter or discourage candidates from using AI?Employing organisations could consider creating a policy about candidates using AI and input measures to mitigate the risks. It is advisable to seek guidance from your organisation’s HR and legal departments before implementing such a policy. A statement or disclaimer could be added to job descriptions and application forms advising that the use of AI is monitored and if applicants have used it then they are required to declare this. Application forms should contain appropriate, role-based specific questions to establish that a candidate has the depth of understanding that is required and consequently make it more difficult for AI to generate adequate responses.




Should employers ban candidates from using AI?It is not recommended to automatically reject applications where the candidate is suspected of using AI (or has openly declared it), however, that decision would need to be made by the individual organisation according to policy. Transparency is important and employers may consider conveying the following messages to candidates:AI-generated content may lack specificity and fail to address key criteria outlined in the job description.Personalisation is essential to convey individual skills, knowledge, and experiences effectively.Over reliance on AI-generated content is discouraged and may diminish the applicant's chances of success.




Are there any positives/benefits to candidates using AI?​​​​​​​AI is becoming more prevalent, and employers need to adapt to its presence and use in the workplace, as much as employees and job seekers are doing. It could be argued that taking advantage of technology to streamline repetitive tasks shows good time management and an openness to changing work style. Studies suggest that more candidates than ever are using AI to help them fill in job applications and this will only continue to increase, particularly those from traditionally disadvantaged groups who are more likely to use AI. Therefore, it is important that employers don’t inadvertently exclude potential candidates in the talent pool by being intolerant to AI. 




AI in the futureAI will continue to evolve and become more sophisticated, therefore, we will aim to track the latest developments and update and expand guidance as appropriate.

Initially, it appeared resistant to using the phrase at all.In the time since, however, chief executive Tim Cook has teased that Apple is working on new generative AI features. He said earlier this year that Apple was investing “a tremendous amount of time and effort”, though without saying what those are.Some of those updates might be revealed at Apple’s upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference, in June. Apple’s marketing chief, Greg Joswiak, announced that event by saying it would be “Absolutely Incredible”, using capital letters in an apparent hint that AI features are coming.Now, however, Apple’s release of what it called “OpenELM” might offer a hint at how those features could work. Apple says the name stands for “Open-source Efficient Language Models”, and that they are relatively small models specifically calibrated for certain tasks.Apple’s developers said the release was made public in the name of “reproducibility and transparency”, which is “crucial for advancing open research, ensuring the trustworthiness of results, and enabling investigations into data and model biases, as well as potential risks”. It did not give any indication that they would be used in future products.However, the fact that Apple is focusing on small and efficient models might be a hint at the way they will appear in the iPhone. Such small models are built specifically to run on consumer devices, rather than the large cloud services that are required to power some other, less efficient AI tools.Apple appears to be looking to build AI models that can run on the iPhone itself, without sending data to its servers. That would be in keeping with Apple’s commitment to privacy, as well as helping to ensure that any AI-powered features run more quickly and do not rely on having a fast internet connection.The company already looks to ensure that as much processing happens on its devices as possible. The new Apple Watch, for instance, includes processer updates that allow more of the AI transcription and understanding for Siri to happen on the device itself.Apple’s new releases are language models, of the kind that power ChatGPT. It already uses such technology in its iPhones to improve the automatic suggestions in the keyboard – but it might use similar technology to help write emails or improve Siri, for instance.Earlier this year, Apple researchers also published a new model that allows users to edit photos by writing messages, and another that can understand what is happening on a smartphone and help people navigate them.More aboutAppleAIartificial intelligencePrivacyJoin our commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesComments1/1Apple releases AI that could show future of iPhonesApple releases AI that could show future of iPhonesGetty Images✕Subscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this articleWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

As a subset of AI, generative systems generate new, original content that follows the patterns and structures of the input data they are trained on. They've been employed successfully in various fields, from creating art and music to simulating realistic human language. As we enter this new age, it becomes essential to understand how this transformative technology might reshape our work lives.A recent report from McKinsey provides a detailed examination of how generative AI stands to impact knowledge work. Traditionally, automation technologies have focused on data management tasks such as collecting and processing data. However, the rise of generative AI, with its inherent natural language capabilities, suggests that the focus of automation could shift dramatically. As the report puts it, “Generative AI’s impact on more physical work activities shifted much less, which isn’t surprising because its capabilities are fundamentally engineered to do cognitive tasks.”With a special emphasis on activities involving decision making and collaboration, generative AI is poised to revolutionize sectors that previously showed low potential for automation. This article explores the report's findings, examining how the incorporation of generative AI is likely to transform the automation potential of knowledge work.Shift in Automation Landscape with Generative AIThe progression of generative AI's capabilities has ushered in an entirely new era for automation. The technologies of the past were well-suited to automating repetitive, data-heavy tasks, but they were less adept at tackling the complexities of cognitive, knowledge-based activities. Generative AI, with its language understanding and generation capabilities, is primed to redefine this landscape significantly.The report estimates that the technical potential to automate the application of expertise has skyrocketed, jumping 34 percentage points. In a similar vein, the potential to automate management and develop talent has risen from 16 percent in 2017 to an astonishing 49 percent in 2023. These are domains traditionally seen as bastions of human-exclusive skills, and their penetration by generative AI signifies a profound shift in the automation landscape.The driving force behind this dramatic rise in automation potential is the capacity of generative AI to understand and use natural language across an array of tasks and activities. It's estimated that roughly 40 percent of activities in the economy require at least a median level of human understanding of natural language. With the generative AI models' ability to comprehend and generate human-like text, a whole new frontier for automation has opened up.This breakthrough has significant implications for jobs involving high levels of communication, supervision, documentation, and general interaction with people. Sectors such as education and technology, which were previously expected to be among the last to see automation, are now at the forefront of this transformative wave. This shift is a testament to the leaps and bounds generative AI has made, and how it's primed to redefine our understanding of automation potential.Generative AI's Impact on Language-Based TasksThese tasks span across various sectors and occupations, but are predominantly found in roles that involve significant communication, supervision, documentation, and general interaction with people. By leveraging generative AI, these language-based tasks can be automated to increase efficiency, reduce human error, and ultimately, revolutionize the way these roles operate.For instance, educators, who have to balance their time between teaching, grading, providing feedback, and administrative work, can offload a considerable amount of their documentation and administrative duties to AI. This not only frees up time for educators to focus on their primary roles but also ensures greater consistency and accuracy in administrative tasks.Similarly, professionals in sectors such as law or healthcare, who spend a substantial amount of their time reading, interpreting, and drafting complex documents, can leverage generative AI to automate some of these tasks. AI can help review contracts, analyze medical reports, and even draft initial versions of documents, freeing up professionals to focus on more nuanced and critical aspects of their work.In effect, generative AI has the potential to redefine the work landscape across sectors. As more language-based tasks are automated, roles and responsibilities will shift, potentially leading to a profound transformation in the nature of work.The Paradox: Generative AI's Impact on Higher-Skill OccupationsInterestingly, unlike previous waves of automation technology, generative AI is poised to impact workers with higher levels of education the most. Traditionally, automation technologies have been “skill-biased,” affecting lower-skilled workers more. However, generative AI turns this concept on its head by presenting a paradox—its biggest incremental impact is likely to be on automating activities of more-educated, higher-skilled workers.This may initially seem counterintuitive, given that higher levels of education often correlate with more complex tasks. However, when examining the skill sets that generative AI targets—such as decision-making, collaboration, expertise application, and especially language understanding—it becomes clear that these are often the purview of professionals with higher educational backgrounds. Roles in law, education, technology, and medicine, for example, all require a high degree of expertise and decision-making capacity, as well as extensive language comprehension and utilization.The ripple effect of this shift could be profound. Educational attainment, often viewed as an indicator of skills, may no longer serve as a robust benchmark in the face of generative AI's capabilities. This challenges the traditional paradigm of workforce development and emphasizes the importance of a more skills-based approach to foster an equitable and efficient system. In essence, generative AI forces us to reconsider our understanding of “skills” and which ones are likely to be replaced or complemented by AI technology.Therefore, the advent of generative AI requires a reassessment of the link between educational attainment and job security in the face of automation. As AI continues to evolve, it's clear that no occupation is entirely immune—a reality that will necessitate a significant rethink in how we approach education and career development.Generative AI and Income DisparityThe impact of generative AI is expected to extend beyond reshaping job roles and responsibilities—it also has the potential to redefine income disparity patterns. Historically, the greatest impact of automation technology has been felt by occupations with wages falling in the middle of the income distribution. Automation for lower-wage occupations was more challenging due to the lower cost of human labor and technical difficulties associated with automating certain tasks. However, generative AI stands to alter this trend significantly.The knowledge-intensive tasks and roles that generative AI targets often correspond to higher-wage knowledge workers. These professions were previously deemed relatively immune to automation due to the complex cognitive tasks they involve. However, advances in generative AI, particularly in natural language understanding and decision-making, mean these roles now have a higher potential for automation.Consequently, generative AI's largest impact could well be on higher-income quintiles. This could potentially lead to a more evenly distributed impact across the income spectrum, contrasting with the ‘hollowing out of the middle' that previous automation technology waves have often precipitated. However, it also underlines a more pressing concern: as generative AI progresses, it becomes clear that even higher-wage, knowledge-intensive roles are not immune to the transformative influence of automation.As generative AI continues to advance, its role in transforming work, redefining skills, and reshaping income disparity will become more pronounced. Therefore, it's crucial for policymakers, educators, and industry leaders to keep pace with these changes, fostering flexible, adaptable workforces and promoting lifelong learning as key tenets of the future of work. Ultimately, as generative AI continues to revolutionize the workplace, it offers not just challenges but also opportunities to create a more equitable, efficient, and innovative economy.Rethinking Automation with Generative AIGenerative AI's potential to reshape the work landscape is profound. It's clear that the technology will have an extensive impact on the tasks we perform, the skills we value, and the income distribution we observe. As generative AI transforms occupations across sectors and skill levels, it forces us to rethink our understanding of automation in the workplace.The rise of generative AI highlights the importance of a new skillset that values adaptability, resilience, and continuous learning. As tasks and roles undergo automation, those that can continually learn and adapt will be the most successful. Companies, therefore, need to foster cultures of lifelong learning and provide resources for workers to continuously upgrade their skills. Moreover, it's important to view these changes not just as a threat but as an opportunity to improve the quality of work and increase overall productivity.In the face of this automation revolution, policymakers also have an essential role to play. As generative AI increases the automation potential of high-skill, high-wage jobs, there's an urgent need to rethink workforce development strategies. Taking a more skills-based approach could lead to more equitable, efficient workforce training, and matching systems.Furthermore, generative AI’s impact on income disparity must be considered. It underscores the need for policies that ensure wealth distribution is equitable and that opportunities are accessible across the income spectrum. As generative AI shapes the future of work, it's paramount that the benefits it brings are shared equitably across society.Overall, the dawn of generative AI signifies a new era in the field of automation—one that can revolutionize knowledge work in ways previously unimaginable. Navigating this change successfully will require foresight, adaptability, and a collective commitment to harnessing the technology's potential for the benefit of all. The future of work with generative AI is still unfolding, and it's a narrative we all have a role in shaping.

What is AI in simple terms?
Artificial intelligence is a computer system that can make predictions about data and rearrange that data in new ways.The term artificial intelligence can broadly be applied to everything from auto-suggested text in an email to photorealistic, real-time generated videos.Within the broad term, types of AI likely to be encountered in business software include generative AI, natural language processing and machine learning.





Artificial intelligence comes in many forms, from simple tools that respond to customers via chat to complex machine learning algorithms that predict the trajectory of an entire organization. Despite years of overpromising, AI doesn’t mean sentient machines that reason like humans; rather, AI encompasses more narrowly focused pattern matching at scale to complement human reasoning.
In order to help business leaders understand what AI capabilities are, how to use artificial intelligence and where to begin an AI journey, it’s essential to first dispel the myths surrounding this huge leap in AI technology.
What is artificial intelligence?
AI is largely a pattern-recognition and prediction computer system that can run at a scale dramatically beyond any human, yet never quite replaces humans. Even at its best, AI delivers acceptable — though not perfect — results, letting people step in, observe the data and reason from there.
Note that while we use AI throughout this cheat sheet, most enterprises engage with a subset of AI called machine learning or deep learning. Contemporary usage of the word in business may imply generative AI, in which trained models remix existing content to form images or sentences in new ways. We’ll use AI here as a shorthand that includes machine learning and deep learning, and specify generative AI when appropriate.
The truth is that current AI technology is limited, but it’s still incredibly powerful. However complicated its processes may seem in practice, at the core of AI-driven applications is the simple ability to identify patterns and make inferences based on those patterns.
AI isn’t truly intelligent, and it’s often as biased as the data we choose to feed into our ML models. That doesn’t mean AI isn’t useful for businesses and consumers trying to solve real-world problems — it means that we’re nowhere close to machines that can actually make independent decisions or arrive at conclusions without being given the proper data first. It’s also true that AI can tend to confirm our biases rather than eliminate them.
How does artificial intelligence work?
AI is a complex system designed to model human behavior and intelligence. It combines large amounts of data with algorithms — sometimes modeled after neurons — to analyze, understand and make decisions or predictions about future states. To make accurate predictions, AI systems require large amounts of data to learn from; this data is gathered from various sources, processed, analyzed and organized in a suitable format for the AI algorithms.
AI algorithms are the core of AI systems and are designed to analyze and interpret data, identify patterns and make predictions or decisions based on the input. By continuously collecting new data and retraining the models, AI systems can adapt to changing conditions and improve their performance.
The core process of how AI works involves the following subdomains:

Machine learning: A branch of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that allow computer systems to learn and improve from data without being explicitly programmed.
Deep learning: A subfield of machine learning that mimics the workings of the human brain’s neural networks, using multiple layers of artificial neural networks to learn and understand complex patterns and features in data.
Neural networks: A computational model, inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, that can process and analyze large amounts of data to recognize patterns, make predictions or classify information.
Natural language processing: A branch of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language, enabling machines to understand, interpret and generate human language.
Computer vision: A branch of AI that enables machines to interpret and understand visual information from images or videos.
Cognitive computing: A model that aims to create AI systems that can simulate human-like intelligence and interact with humans in a more natural and intuitive way.
Generative AI: A combination of other subdomains on this list, including machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing and cognitive computer, generative AI creates remixed content such as conversations or videos.

Generative AI
Generative AI systems are capable of creating content, such as images, videos, music or text, that is nearly indistinguishable from human-generated content. They can autonomously generate new outputs based on their learned patterns and styles.
Generative adversarial networks are an example of generative AI, where one network generates content, and another network evaluates and provides feedback to improve the quality of the generated output.
Popular examples of generative AI include:

OpenAI’s ChatGPT: A generative pretrained transformer is a language model developed by OpenAI to generate human-like text based on a given prompt. The latest model, GPT-4, was trained on Microsoft Azure AI supercomputers and is available on ChatGPT Plus.
Microsoft Copilot: A generative AI assistant trained on GPT-4.
Google Gemini: A chatbot and productivity assistant running on Google’s LaMDA model, experimentally integrated into Google Search.
Stable Diffusion: A model from Stability AI that makes images from text prompts.


What can artificial intelligence do?
Artificial intelligence is essentially pattern matching at scale. With its pattern recognition capabilities, modern AI can perform image recognition, understand the natural language and writing patterns of humans, make connections between different types of data, identify abnormalities in patterns, strategize, predict and more.
While humans are unable to as easily comb through the amount of data that machines can to uncover patterns, machines struggle when presented with an outlier that might be easy for a human to spot but contradicts the training data. Therefore, the best AI applications are highly focused and combine human reasoning with the brute power of ML.

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, AI and ML saw a massive market growth. The global pandemic also shifted AI priorities and applications: Instead of solely focusing on financial analysis and consumer insight, post-pandemic AI projects have trended toward customer experience and cost optimization.
AI bots can perform many basic customer service tasks, freeing employees up to only address cases that need human intervention. AI like this has been particularly widespread since the start of the pandemic, when workers forced out of call centers put stress on customer service.
Since then, the release of ChatGPT in November 2022, popularized generative AI.

What are the business applications of AI?
In the business world, there are plenty of AI applications, but perhaps none is gaining traction as much as business and predictive analytics and its end goal: prescriptive analytics.
Business analytics is a complicated set of processes that aim to model the present state of a business, predict where it will go if kept on its current trajectory and model potential futures with a given set of changes. Predicting the future with an established model of the past can be easy enough, but prescriptive analysis, which aims to find the best possible outcome by tweaking an organization’s current course, can be downright impossible without AI help.
Other AI use cases for businesses include the following:

Recruiting and employment: AI can streamline recruiting by filtering through larger numbers of candidates more quickly than a human and by noticing qualified people who may be overlooked.
Fraud detection: AI is great at picking up on subtle differences and irregular behavior, such as subtle indicators of financial fraud that humans may miss.
Cybersecurity: AI is great at detecting indicators of hacking and other cybersecurity issues.
Data management: Using AI, you can categorize raw data and find relationships between items that were previously unknown.
Customer relations: Modern AI-powered chatbots are incredibly good at carrying on conversations thanks to natural language processing, making them a great first line of customer service.
Healthcare: Not only are some AI applications able to detect cancer and other health concerns before doctors, they can also provide feedback on patient care based on long-term records and trends.
Predicting market trends: Much like prescriptive analysis in the business analytics world, AI systems can be trained to predict trends in larger markets, which can lead to businesses getting a jump on emerging trends.
Reducing energy use: AI can streamline energy use in buildings and even across cities, as well as make better predictions for construction planning, oil and gas drilling, and other energy-centric projects.
Marketing: AI systems can be trained to increase the value of marketing both toward individuals and larger markets, helping organizations save money and get better marketing results.

What AI platforms are available?
When adopting an AI strategy, it’s important to know what software is available for business-focused AI. There are a wide variety of platforms available from the usual cloud computing suspects like Google, AWS, Microsoft and IBM, and choosing the right one can mean the difference between success and failure.
AWS Machine Learning
AWS Machine Learning offers a wide variety of services that run in the AWS cloud. AI services, prebuilt frameworks, analytics tools and more are all available, with many designed to take the legwork out of getting started and others like SageMaker for Business Analysts designed to enable corporations to get AI insight without writing code. AWS offers prebuilt AI algorithms, one-click ML training and training tools for developers getting started in or expanding their knowledge of AI development.

Google Cloud
Google Cloud offers similar AI solutions to AWS, as well as having several prebuilt total AI solutions that organizations can ideally plug into their organizations with minimal effort. Google also distinguishes itself by innovating some of the industry standards for AI like TensorFlow, an open-source ML library.

Microsoft AI
Microsoft’s AI platform comes with pre-generated services, ready-to-deploy cloud computing infrastructure and a variety of additional AI tools that can be plugged into existing models. Its AI Lab also offers a wide range of AI apps that developers can tinker with and learn from what others have done. Microsoft also offers an AI school with educational tracks specifically for business applications.

OpenAI
Developers can choose between a variety of text and image generative AI models from OpenAI, makers of the popular chatbot ChatGPT. As of November 2023, OpenAI offered fine-tuned, custom models based on GPT-4. These custom models are appropriate for organizations with large proprietary datasets and can be accessed through an API. In April 2024, OpenAI added a playground for comparing different models’ quality and performance, as well as other quality of life and integration updates.

IBM watsonx
IBM’s Watson was an early example of question-answering AI and has evolved in several directions as business software. Now, IBM is mostly leaning into watsonx instead, which is a cloud-hosted generative AI and data analytics platform. IBM offers on-site servers custom-built for AI tasks for businesses that don’t want to rely on cloud hosting.

What AI skills do businesses need to invest in?
Perhaps the most critical skill needed to use AI is knowing when to skip AI altogether. The reality of AI is that many problems could be solved by applying simple regression analysis or if/then statements. Most AI, in other words, isn’t AI at all: It’s only basic math and common sense.
For more complicated, AI-oriented tasks, the associated data science breaks down into two categories: that which is intended for human consumption and that which is intended for machine consumption.
SEE: Learn what you need to know to become a machine learning engineer.
In the latter case, AI involves complex digital models that apply ML models and AI algorithms to large amounts of data. These systems then act autonomously to generate a particular ad or customer experience or make real-time stock trades. Hence, machine-oriented AI professions require “exceptionally strong mathematical, statistical and computational fluency to build models that can quickly make good predictions,” as former Google and Foursquare data scientist Michael Li has noted.
By contrast, the skills needed for more human-oriented data science and AI skew toward storytelling. Given that no data is unbiased, the role of human intelligence is to help the data tell clear stories. Such AI storytellers use data visualization to facilitate exploration and insights into that data.
For many in AI, the most sophisticated math they’ll do is power analyses and significance tests. They might write SQL queries to get data, do basic math on that data, graph results and then explain the results. Not gee whiz data science, but it’s incredibly helpful for breaking down complex data into actionable insights, to use the data science lingo.
With all that in mind, it’s still true that skills needed for an AI project differ based on business needs and the platform being used, though most of the biggest platforms support most, if not all, of the most commonly used AI programming languages and skills needed.
Many business AI platforms offer training courses in the specifics of running their architecture and the programming languages needed to develop more AI tools. Businesses that are serious about AI should plan to either hire new employees or give existing ones the time and resources necessary to train in the skills needed to make AI projects succeed.
How can businesses start using AI?
Getting started with business AI isn’t as easy as simply spending money on an AI platform provider and spinning up some prebuilt models and algorithms. There’s a lot that goes into successfully adding AI to an organization.
At the heart of it all is good project planning. Adding artificial intelligence to a business, no matter how it will be used, is like any business transformation initiative. Here’s an outline of just one way to approach getting started with business AI.
Determine your AI objective
To begin, figure out how AI can be used in your organization and to what end. By focusing on a narrower implementation with a specific goal, you can better allocate resources.
Identify what needs to happen to get there
Once you know where you want to be, you can figure out where you are and how to make the journey. This could include starting to sort existing data, gathering new data, hiring talent and other preliminary steps.
Build a team
With an end goal in sight and a plan to get there, it’s time to assemble the best team to make it happen. This can include current employees, but don’t be afraid to go outside the organization to find the most qualified people. Be sure to allow existing staff to train so they have the opportunity to contribute to the project.
Choose an AI platform
Some AI platforms may be better suited to particular projects, but by and large they all offer similar products in order to compete with each other. Let your team give recommendations on which AI platform to choose — they’re the experts who will be in the trenches.
Begin implementation
With a goal, team and platform, you’re ready to start working in earnest. This won’t be quick: AI models need to be trained, testing on subsets of data has to be performed and lots of tweaks will need to be made before a business AI is ready to hit the real world. In fact, you should expect that the vast majority of your time won’t be spent crafting trendy algorithms, but rather in data preparation.

ISTANBUL, TURKEY - MAY 06:  A woman views historical documents and photographs displayed in a high ... [+] tech art installation at Salt Galata on May 6, 2017 in Istanbul, Turkey. The ""Archive Dreaming"" installation by artist Refik Anadol uses artificial intelligence to visualize nearly 2 million historical Ottoman documents and photographs from the SALT Research Archive. Controlled by a single tablet in the center of a mirrored room the artist used machine learning algorithms to combine historical documents, art, graphics and photographs to create an immersive installation allowing people to scroll, read and explore the archives. The SALT Galata archives include around 1.7 million documents ranging from the late-Ottoman era to the present day. The exhibition is on show at SALT Galata art space through till June 11, 2017.

AI is changing business profoundly and quickly. It is enabling new business models, making existing business models radically more efficient, and creating the potential for products conceived in entirely new ways. It is also making individual contributors more productive at day-to-day tasks, from writing code to writing memos. How should business leaders manage the breadth and depth and speed of this disruption?

Many people are advocating for a new role, that of a Chief AI Officer. President Joe Biden has issued an Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence, which requires that each agency designate such a leader. The Department of Justice is the first to do so, naming a Princeton computer scientist its Chief AI Officer. Mark Minevich, a Forbes Contributor, writes about ""The Rise Of The Chief AI Officer: Powering AI’s Corporate Revolution."" The New York Times headlined, ""Hottest Job in Corporate America? The Executive in Charge of A.I.”

PROMOTED
Clearly something is happening. A common element in these articles is the description of a job with an extraordinary breadth. The person must be strategic, operational, deeply technical, transformational, and capable of integrating ethics with AI initiatives. Is this even possible? If it were, is it really the path to the integration of AI into the business?

In many ways, the call for a Chief AI Officer is akin to previous organizational responses to major new technological capabilities, like the Head of Re-engineering, the Chief eBusiness Officer, the Chief Data Officer and the Chief Innovation Officer. In each case, the goal was to put an executive in charge who could work across functions, break down silos, and accelerate change.

But Jane Edison Stevenson, Vice Chair of Board and CEO Services at Korn Ferry, believes that something more fundamental is happening this time. She has lived through the earlier waves with a bird's eye view as an executive recruiter, and she was a leader in recruiting some of the very early Chief Innovation Officers. Stevenson believes that AI is a disruptive technology that all executives need to embrace - and she has not come across any who are in denial about this wave of change. The question remains: how should businesses adapt?.

The larger frame within which to place this challenge is what Stevenson calls enterprise leadership: the ""ability to both perform and transform simultaneously and to think horizontally, not just vertically."" “The ability to perform consistently is table stakes,"" she told me in an interview. ""The need (is) to transform real-time, every day, at the same time that you perform"". AI is an important part of the current complexity this new breed of executives must manage. Although a Chief AI Officer may provide coordination and awareness, the need is deeper.

So what should executives do to respond to the AI revolution? It depends on your function. The Chief Strategy Officer needs to become deeply aware of the potential of AI to challenge the business model and strategy of the firm. This includes the potential for AI to create a new set of competitors who compete by embedding AI into every aspect of their operations. In Competing in the Age of AI, Marco Iansiti and Karim Lakhani give examples of companies that have created an 'AI factory' at the heart of their operations. Companies as different as Moderna and Ant Financial generate economies of scope and economies of scale at the same time. They do so by using AI to improve and speed up entire processes. People become monitors of the process and are out of the flow of execution. The Chief Strategy Officer needs to understand these new operating models and lead the organization on paths that can survive the existential threats and realize the extraordinary potential of AI.
The Chief Innovation Officer needs to look at AI through a different lens. He or she needs to foster experimentation with the ways AI is being used to dramatically increase both innovation speed and breadth. Experiments with specialized tools like Ethan Mollick's Innovator, available through ChatGPT, indicate the potential. Mollick has shown that his students at the University of Pennsylvania move through the front end of innovation faster and more creatively when using such tools. He mandates their use in his classes.
AlgoVerde, a Silicon Valley startup, has integrated a generative AI innovation platform across the design lifecycle. Vladimir Jacimovic, CEO of AlgoVerde, says that the use of virtual twins of both customers and technical experts ""can speed the path of innovation from business challenge to concept by a factor of ten""(emphasis added). To understand the role that generative AI could play in their functions, Chief Innovation Officers need to do experiments and encourage their staffs to do the same.
Chief Technology Officers and R&D leaders face a different opportunity. They can use AI to simulate products before they are even prototyped, including their integration with customer systems. They can speed up R&D processes, sometimes dramatically. Daniil Boiko, Robert MacKnight and Gabe Gomes, all of Carnegie Mellon University, used generative AI to create an AI system ""for autonomous design, planning, and execution of scientific experiments,"" for example, greatly increasing the pace of their research. Generative AI can also be used to increase the design space for products, as AutoDesk has demonstrated with 3D printing designs created using generative techniques. Finally, CTOs can use generative AI to create smart and accessible products - products that are easier to use and to personalize than was previously possible.
Chief Operating Officers must lead the use of AI to improve operations. This often starts with the automation of point solutions. Many companies see call centers as a ripe opportunity, though simple displacement of jobs may not be the best approach. There is room for an entirely new wave of re-engineering, one driven from the shop floor up.
Even Chief HR Officers have a unique role in the integration of AI into operations. They need to understand the emerging tools and how individuals can be empowered to use them in their work. There are already concerns that such tools might leak confidential information or create security threats. At the same time, a large body of studies is demonstrating that the use of large language models can increase productivity across a range of knowledge work in surprising ways (see “Navigating the Jagged Technological Frontier: Field Experimental Evidence of the Effects of AI on Knowledge Worker Productivity and Quality). Today, many companies limit the use of generative AI because of security and IP concerns. CHROs can break down roadblocks and encourage experimentation and sharing of results. CHROs may also take a lead in highlighting ethical issues.
The point is that the role of leading in the Age of AI is not one that can be managed by an individual, no matter how skilled. Each member of the C-Suite needs to find ways that will move his or her role to the next level. This requires that they each become educated on the potential - and spend time experimenting with tools themselves. Without some hands-on experience, the potential will seem abstract.
The easiest thing in the world a CEO can do to respond to the threat of this uncertain and poorly understood technology is to appoint a Chief AI Officer. The problem is that it is unlikely to be the silver bullet that it promises to be. At worse, it might cause others to defer their own learning journey and delay real adoption.

Not all jobs are vulnerable to artificial intelligence, according to three AI experts, who say some jobs will simply evolve in the future.
Consumers still prefer personalized support over chatbots, and AI still lacks the creativity to handle some complex problems and strategic planning.
In some industries such as cybersecurity AI will usher in new career opportunities.
Employees in many industries are worried about whether artificial intelligence will make their jobs irrelevant. While these fears are valid, the human element is still highly valued, according to a trio of AI experts who were asked to reflect on whether AI is likely to steal jobs in the near future.Getty ImagesSome studies have shown that people still prefer to receive more personalized support from employees than from AI technology – receiving customer service from a person rather than a chatbot, for example. Back in 2019, 86% of people said they preferred interacting with a real person to a chatbot, according to a survey of 1,000 consumers by CGS, a business applications, outsourcing and learning company. In 2023, that number hadn’t changed much, with 80% of consumers still preferring human interaction, according to a survey by Invoca, a company that uses AI in call tracking and conversational analytics solutions.Read: 13 Signs You May Be Facing a Layoff.Will AI Take My Job?Even with the accelerated adoption of AI, the human touch is still necessary, wrote Cory Halbardier, chief operating officer of Blazeo, an ad conversion platform, in an email.“Take chatbots for instance – especially for small businesses that don't have the time or resources to tend to leads 24/7, automated tools are imperative,” Halbardier said. “If no live person is guiding these tools, many customers don't receive the empathy, understanding and communication they need. That is also often the determining factor of whether they continue considering a service or get frustrated and move on to the next option.” This is why AI technologies still need human guidance to improve and run at all, he added. “They're not going to replace live humans soon or ever,"" Halbardier said.As an ex-IBM internet security systems engineer and founder of IT services company Cyber Command LLC, Reade Taylor’s perspective on AI's impact on jobs is shaped by his experience integrating new technologies into business operations. He’s seen AI's potential not just as a disruptor, but as a catalyst for creating new opportunities and enhancing the effectiveness of human efforts in the cybersecurity realm.“AI is indeed reshaping jobs, but it's important to distinguish between job displacement and job transformation,” Taylor said in an email. “In cybersecurity, for example, AI has taken over tedious tasks such as monitoring network traffic for anomalies, which allows human analysts to focus on more complex threat analyses and strategic security planning.” Taylor emphasized that this shift is elevating the roles of IT professionals, making their work more impactful and strategic. Rather than stealing jobs, he says, AI is augmenting the human workforce by providing tools that can handle the increasing volume and sophistication of cyberthreats.READ: 10 Best-Paying Tech JobsWhat Jobs Will AI Replace?The jobs that AI will replace are “simple, menial jobs” that involve basic data entry and basic problem-solving, wrote AI researcher Regina Grogan, in an email. The reason for this is that AI lacks the human ingenuity and creativity to solve extremely complex problems – for now.“AI models struggle to take many conflicting factors and ideas into account; the nuance isn't there,” Grogan said. “Lots of jobs people do, at least in the white-collar sector, involve a lot of nuance, judgment and decision-making. AI doesn't perform well there.”When considering which jobs AI will replace, Reade suggested sectors where AI can perform tasks more efficiently and with fewer errors than humans. He reemphasized that this doesn't always mean job loss. Instead, it often means job evolution. For instance, he pointed out that AI's role in software development is growing, particularly in areas like automated testing and code generation.READ: 15 Jobs to Consider for a Career ChangeWill AI Replace Programmers?Some experts say that computer programmers are particularly vulnerable to AI. But Grogan points out that it isn’t that easy for AI to produce the same quality of work as human programmers. “When I see code written by AI, I also see lots of problems,” she said. “It's easy, as of yet, to inject malicious attacks into the code and into large language models in general. So, from the lens of security, it's probably not a great idea to copy and paste AI-generated code from the internet into your codebase – not only for logistical reasons like problems in the code but because of malicious code attacks that can affect the security of your company.”Instead of eliminating programmer positions, Grogan believes AI could create jobs focused on secure code and secure code review. “This is because if people are actually going to use AI-generated code, they have to focus on the security of their organization,” she said. “We've seen AI-related cyberattacks rise across the board, so if companies are going to use AI, they have to take the right precautions.” Grogan also predicts that as people become more concerned about the privacy and security of some of these applications, AI is likely to create many jobs in data security and data privacy.Reade agreed that AI is unlikely to replace programmers outright. Instead, he predicts it will change the nature of programming jobs, requiring programmers to adapt and work alongside AI, leveraging its capabilities to enhance productivity and innovation. “While AI might automate certain programming tasks, the demand for skilled programmers capable of designing algorithms, improving AI systems and integrating ethical AI use into software development is on the rise,” Reade said.What Is Career Cushioning?Career cushioning is when professionals create backup career opportunities in case they lose their jobsRobin MadellOct. 31, 2023Tags: careers, Company Culture, artificial intelligence, employmentAbout On CareersOur expert contributors give their best advice on answering common interview questions, perfecting job applications, negotiating salary and more.Find savvy job advice from the brains behind top careers blogs and websites, including Robin Madell, Robin Reshwan and Hallie Crawford.RECOMMENDEDCareersHow to Be More Assertive at WorkOn Careers7 Benefits of Working From HomeCareersHow to Quit a Job You Just StartedCareers20 Best Questions to Ask an InterviewerOn CareersWrite a Goodbye Email to Co-Workers",NewsArticle,,,,,,"{'@type': 'WebPage', 'name': 'Will Artificial Intelligence Steal My Job?', '@id': 'https://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/articles/will-artificial-intelligence-steal-my-job', 'url': 'https://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/articles/will-artificial-intelligence-steal-my-job'}",Will Artificial Intelligence Steal My Job?,2024-04-19T09:45-0400,2024-04-23T09:44-0400,https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/6c64f6c/2147483647/thumbnail/80x60/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2Fb1%2Fa1%2Ff531930c43b6847aa69bb8532767%2Fhttps-media-gettyimages-com-id-1468240228-photo-3d-human-glass-head.jpg,,"{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'U.S. News & World Report', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 193, 'url': 'https://www.usnews.com/static/images/usn-logo-print.png', 'height': 46}}","[{'image': 'https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/e2af83c/2147483647/thumbnail/300x300/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2Fbb%2Fc6%2F4b4286a146a1855d1196a4256552%2Frobin-madell.jpg', '@type': 'Person', 'jobTitle': 'Contributor', 'name': 'Robin Madell', 'url': 'https://www.usnews.com/topics/author/robin-madell'}, {'image': 'https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/3279cf7/2147483647/crop/371x371+0+0/resize/300x300/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2F64%2F2b%2Ffbc5d5974505bfec3d939b38b43b%2Fkaty-marquardt.jpg', '@type': 'Person', 'jobTitle': 'Contributor', 'name': 'Katy Marquardt', 'url': 'https://www.usnews.com/topics/author/marquardt_katy'}, {'image': 'https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/c6217f8/2147483647/thumbnail/300x300/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2Fe8%2F01%2Ff95b262541d3b4da25397a14bd4b%2Fsusannah-snider.jpg', '@type': 'Person', 'jobTitle': 'Managing Editor, Money', 'name': 'Susannah Snider', 'url': 'https://www.usnews.com/topics/author/susannah-snider'}]","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': '970', 'url': 'https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/04b51e9/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2Fb1%2Fa1%2Ff531930c43b6847aa69bb8532767%2Fhttps-media-gettyimages-com-id-1468240228-photo-3d-human-glass-head.jpg', 'height': '647'}",,,,,,,,,938.0,"Employees in many industries are worried about whether artificial intelligence will make their jobs irrelevant.

In 2023, that number hadn’t changed much, with 80% of consumers still preferring human interaction, according to a survey by Invoca, a company that uses AI in call tracking and conversational analytics solutions.Even with the accelerated adoption of AI, the human touch is still necessary, wrote Cory Halbardier, chief operating officer of Blazeo, an ad conversion platform, in an email.“Take chatbots for instance – especially for small businesses that don't have the time or resources to tend to leads 24/7, automated tools are imperative,” Halbardier said. “If no live person is guiding these tools, many customers don't receive the empathy, understanding and communication they need. That is also often the determining factor of whether they continue considering a service or get frustrated and move on to the next option.” This is why AI technologies still need human guidance to improve and run at all, he added. “They're not going to replace live humans soon or ever,"" Halbardier said.As an ex-IBM internet security systems engineer and founder of IT services company Cyber Command LLC, Reade Taylor’s perspective on AI's impact on jobs is shaped by his experience integrating new technologies into business operations. He’s seen AI's potential not just as a disruptor, but as a catalyst for creating new opportunities and enhancing the effectiveness of human efforts in the cybersecurity realm.“AI is indeed reshaping jobs, but it's important to distinguish between job displacement and job transformation,” Taylor said in an email. “In cybersecurity, for example, AI has taken over tedious tasks such as monitoring network traffic for anomalies, which allows human analysts to focus on more complex threat analyses and strategic security planning.” Taylor emphasized that this shift is elevating the roles of IT professionals, making their work more impactful and strategic. Rather than stealing jobs, he says, AI is augmenting the human workforce by providing tools that can handle the increasing volume and sophistication of cyberthreats.The jobs that AI will replace are “simple, menial jobs” that involve basic data entry and basic problem-solving, wrote AI researcher Regina Grogan, in an email. The reason for this is that AI lacks the human ingenuity and creativity to solve extremely complex problems – for now.“AI models struggle to take many conflicting factors and ideas into account; the nuance isn't there,” Grogan said. “Lots of jobs people do, at least in the white-collar sector, involve a lot of nuance, judgment and decision-making. AI doesn't perform well there.”When considering which jobs AI will replace, Reade suggested sectors where AI can perform tasks more efficiently and with fewer errors than humans. He reemphasized that this doesn't always mean job loss. Instead, it often means job evolution. For instance, he pointed out that AI's role in software development is growing, particularly in areas like automated testing and code generation.Some experts say that computer programmers are particularly vulnerable to AI. But Grogan points out that it isn’t that easy for AI to produce the same quality of work as human programmers. “When I see code written by AI, I also see lots of problems,” she said. “It's easy, as of yet, to inject malicious attacks into the code and into large language models in general. So, from the lens of security, it's probably not a great idea to copy and paste AI-generated code from the internet into your codebase – not only for logistical reasons like problems in the code but because of malicious code attacks that can affect the security of your company.”Instead of eliminating programmer positions, Grogan believes AI could create jobs focused on secure code and secure code review. “This is because if people are actually going to use AI-generated code, they have to focus on the security of their organization,” she said. “We've seen AI-related cyberattacks rise across the board, so if companies are going to use AI, they have to take the right precautions.” Grogan also predicts that as people become more concerned about the privacy and security of some of these applications, AI is likely to create many jobs in data security and data privacy.Reade agreed that AI is unlikely to replace programmers outright. Instead, he predicts it will change the nature of programming jobs, requiring programmers to adapt and work alongside AI, leveraging its capabilities to enhance productivity and innovation. “While AI might automate certain programming tasks, the demand for skilled programmers capable of designing algorithms, improving AI systems and integrating ethical AI use into software development is on the rise,” Reade said.",2024-04-19T09:45-0400,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

		AI, like previous technological advancements, will transform how we live, work, and think. What can we learn from the past for guidance on how to thrive during today’s intelligence revolution?

In April 1860, the Pony Express launched its operation to much fanfare. Using a series of riders on horses to relay messages from Missouri to California, it became an instant icon of the Wild West.
The service lasted all of eighteen months. The Pony Express couldn’t compete with the transcontinental telegraph, completed in 1861, which delivered messages in a fraction of the time.
With AI poised to transform work today, we all have some degree of fear that our jobs will go the way of the Pony Express. But we miss the full story when we focus only on the fate of the famed riders.
 
 
 













 
 

How the newfangled technology of the telegraph made one job obsolete while spawning countless others is an example of an important historical lesson for today: major technological advancements are catalysts for creating jobs, even entire new industries.

AI stands to be the next revolutionary advancement because it has the ability to learn and far surpass human intelligence, enabling it to analyze data more deeply and generate insights that would be impossible for humans alone. Rather than killing jobs, AI will create new jobs that were unimaginable just a few years before.
What should enterprises learn from the past in order to thrive during this rapidly advancing intelligence revolution?
 
 
 













 
 

New technology, same pattern
Every major technological revolution follows a similar pattern: a new technology comes along which upends the old ways of doing things, resulting in major changes to how we live, work, and think.
During the agricultural revolution, we built villages and towns, took on new jobs to support farming, and started thinking differently about things like land ownership and trade. The industrial revolution that followed saw us moving to cities, working in manufacturing, and developing new ideas like consumerism and automation.
Electricity, telecommunications, the computer, and every other major technological development has had the same effect: the world transformed in ways that we’d never imagined just a generation before.
 
 
 













 
 

The level of change these technological revolutions bring about is monumental. For example, in 1870 half of all workers in the United States were agricultural; by 1900, one generation later, that number had dropped to one-third. Now that number is around 4%. There are more people to feed today but that’s offset by how much more efficient agricultural work has become.
Artificial intelligence is the next great disruptor. We are witnessing an intelligence revolution where AI will give us access to capabilities, information, and insights that go well beyond human capacity. Just like the revolutions before, this one will fundamentally transform how we live, work, and think.
Technology as a job creator
One change we already see unfolding is how we consume data. We do not need to find data, search through results, or spend time compiling information in the same way as the past. As a result, how we think about information, including authorship, may change dramatically. This example is just the tip of the iceberg for what is coming.
 
 
 













 
 

So what will work look like in the AI-first era? It can be hard to predict because these moments are so transformative. After all, you couldn’t imagine the job of electrician before electricity.
We can see patterns emerging. Companies are wanting to build large language models, so we know jobs to build, maintain, and utilize these LLMs will multiply. But we also know jobs will be created that are beyond the limits of our current imagination.
Fifty percent of the workforce no longer in agriculture today doesn’t mean that fifty percent of workers are unemployed. Instead, they moved into other industries. History shows us that during each of these technological revolutions, the net outcome is job creation, especially in entirely new sectors.
 
 
 













 
 

Yes, the telegraph killed the Pony Express, but anyone looking around in 1861 would have found a job market flourishing with new professions like line repair staff and skilled operators. It’s crucial to note that many of these new jobs went to women and provided better pay, mobility, and independence during a time of limited opportunity.
The intelligence revolution will be just as transformative for work, and we can look back for insight into what changes AI might bring. Most of the new jobs created during other tech revolutions fall into one of two categories: (1) jobs that support the new technology and (2) jobs that use the new technology.
On the support side, we’ll see a major expansion in IT jobs that help develop and implement AI. These will be the steam engine builders and loom fabricators for the AI age. Recently, many companies have prioritized jobs that support AI. They are hyper focused on AI development, paying a premium for those with AI skills, while devaluing or even eliminating other positions.
 
 
 













 
 

But just as a factory of loom builders alone couldn’t make fabric, an enterprise of AI builders alone cannot use AI. We need to think about what to do with the technology, rather than just having the technology itself.
Jobs that use the new technology are equally important as the builders of the technology, even if we don’t know what most of those future jobs might be.
No crystal ball, no problem
Given the lack of clarity on what the jobs and uses of AI will be in the future, what should businesses do? This uncertainty actually suggests a clear path forward. Businesses should of course be investing in jobs that support AI. Chief AI Officer, Prompt Engineer, and AI Research Scientist are a few examples.
 
 
 













 
 

But what happens when we build all these amazing AI capabilities without developing the use cases? We also must invest in workers with the skills to identify and develop the applications for AI.

Companies need workers who can imagine how we might live, work, and think in new ways. Open-mindedness is crucial because, in this moment of transition, fixating on what’s already been done and assumed limitations hinders innovation. Skills like problem solving and critical thinking are invaluable. We need strong analytical thinkers who can get to the root of problems and imagine innovative solutions harnessing AI.
In short, creativity is just as important as domain expertise for enterprises looking to capitalize on the intelligence revolution.
 
 
 













 
 

Such soft skills are harder to quantify or hire for than say a computer science degree, but they are critical. One of AI’s many future use cases will be to help enterprises better map employees’ full skillsets and develop workers’ soft and hard skills.
Just like with past technological revolutions, we can’t predict what is coming. But we can work to have the right people in place at the right time to help enterprises and society transform.
A fast revolution
Today’s intelligence revolution does differ from the past because of the pace of change. After decades of effort, the first telegraphs appeared in the 1830s. It took another thirty years, and financial support from Congress to help complete the line, before the telegraph could actually outcompete the Pony Express.
 
 
 













 
 

Today, geography and money are not holding AI back and the technology has already advanced substantially in a matter of months. AI may follow the same pattern as past tech advancements, but it is on an exponentially accelerated timeline. We’re right at the start and will get to witness, and also hopefully shape, how this new technology will transform the world.
Much of the textbook chapter on the intelligence revolution is still being written, but I feel pretty confident that the chapter title will not be “job killer.” Given how fast things are changing, we shouldn’t have to wait too long to find out.

A.I. is detecting early signs of the disease, in some cases years before doctors would find the cancer on a traditional scan.  A chemotherapy alternative called immunotherapy is showing promise in treating cancer — and a new artificial intelligence tool could help ensure that patients have the best possible experience.    Immunotherapy, first approved in 2011, uses the cancer patient’s own immune system to target and fight cancer. While it doesn’t work for everyone, for the 15% to 20% who do see results, it can be life-saving.  WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?  Like any medication, immunotherapy has the potential for adverse side effects — which can be severe for some.   Studies show that some 10% to 15% of patients develop ""significant toxicities.""  A chemotherapy alternative called immunotherapy is showing promise in treating cancer — and a new artificial intelligence tool could help ensure that patients have the best possible experience. (iStock)Headquartered in Chicago, GE HealthCare — working in tandem with Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) in Nashville, Tennessee — has created an AI model that's designed to help remove some of the uncertainties surrounding immunotherapy.  Over the five years it’s been in development, the AI model was trained on thousands of patients’ electronic health records (EHRs) to recognize patterns in how they responded to immunotherapy, focusing on safety and effectiveness.AI MODEL COULD HELP PREDICT LUNG CANCER RISKS IN NON-SMOKERS, STUDY FINDS: ‘SIGNIFICANT ADVANCEMENT’  ""The model predicts which patients are likely to derive the benefit from immunotherapy versus those patients who may not,"" said Jan Wolber, global digital product leader at GE HealthCare’s pharmaceutical diagnostics segment, in an interview with Fox News Digital.    ""It also predicts which patients have a likelihood of developing one or more significant toxicities.""When pulling data from the patient’s health record, the model looks at demographic information, preexisting diagnoses, lifestyle habits (such as smoking), medication history and more.  Immunotherapy, which was first approved in 2011, uses the cancer patient’s immune system to target and fight cancer.  (iStock)""All of these data are already being collected by the patient’s oncologist, or they’re filling out a form in the waiting room ahead of time,"" said Travis Osterman, a medical oncologist and associate chief medical information officer at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, in an interview with Fox News Digital.    (Osterman is working with Wolber on the development of the AI model.)BREAST CANCER BREAKTHROUGH: AI PREDICTS A THIRD OF CASES PRIOR TO DIAGNOSIS IN MAMMOGRAPHY STUDY""We're not asking for additional blood samples or complex imaging. These are all data points that we're already collecting — vital signs, diagnoses, lab values, those sorts of things.""  In a study, the AI model showed 70% to 80% accuracy in predicting patients’ responses to immunotherapies, according to an article published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology Clinical Cancer Informatics.    ""While the models are not perfect, this is actually a very good result,"" Wolber said. ""We can implement those models with very little additional effort because there are no additional measurements required in the clinic.""‘Natural progression’This type of technology is ""a natural progression of what we've been doing in medicine for a very long time,"" Osterman said.  ""The only difference is, instead of surveying patients, we're taking the entirety of the medical record and looking for risk factors that contribute to an outcome,"" he said in an interview with Fox News Digital.  The AI model was trained on thousands of patients’ electronic health records to recognize patterns in how they responded to immunotherapy, focusing on safety and effectiveness. (iStock)With immunotherapy, there is generally a lower response rate than with chemotherapy, Osterman noted — but some patients have ""incredible responses"" and ultimately become cancer-free.  ""I would be horrified to know that one of my patients that I didn't give immunotherapy to could have been one of the tremendous responders,"" he told Fox News Digital.   Conversely, Osterman noted that in rare cases, immunotherapy can have some serious side effects.""I would be horrified to know that one of my patients that I didn't give immunotherapy to could have been one of the tremendous responders."" ""I would say about half of patients don't have any side effects, but for those who do, some of them are really life-altering,"" he said.   ""We don't want to miss anyone, but we also don't want to harm anyone.""    At the core of the AI project, Osterman said, is the ability to ""put all the information into the exam room,"" so the oncologist can counsel the patient about the risks and benefits of this particular therapy and make the best, most informed decision about their care. Combining technology and human expertiseDr. Marc Siegel, clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and a Fox News medical contributor, was not involved in the AI model’s development but commented on its potential.""AI models are emerging that are helping to manage responses to cancer treatments,"" he told Fox News Digital.   Dr. Marc Siegel, clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and a Fox News medical contributor, was not involved in the AI model’s development but weighed in on its potential. ""AI models are emerging that are helping to manage responses to cancer treatments,"" he said. (Dr. Marc Siegel)  ""These can allow for more treatment options and be more predictive of outcome.""  AI models like this one are an example of ""the essential future of personalized medicine,"" Siegel said, ""where each patient is approached differently and their cancer is analyzed and treated with precision using genetic and protein analysis.""As long as physicians and scientists remain in charge — ""not a computer or robot"" — Siegel said that ""there is no downside.""Potential limitations    The AI model does carry some degree of limitations, the experts acknowledged.""The models obviously do not return 100% accuracy,"" Wolber told Fox News Digital. ""So there are some so-called false positives or false negatives.""   NEW AI ‘CANCER CHATBOT’ PROVIDES PATIENTS AND FAMILIES WITH 24/7 SUPPORT: 'EMPATHETIC APPROACH'  The tool is not a ""black box"" that will provide a surefire answer, he noted. Rather, it's a tool that provides data points to the clinician and informs them as they make patient management decisions.Osterman pointed out that the AI model uses a ""relatively small dataset.""""We would love to be able to refine our predictions by learning on bigger data sets,"" he said.  The tool is not a ""black box"" that will provide a surefire answer, one of the researchers said; rather, it's a tool that provides data points to clinicians and informs them as they make patient management decisions. (iStock)    The team is currently looking for partnerships that will enable them to test the AI model in new settings and achieve even higher accuracy in its predictions.   Another challenge, Osterman said, is the need to integrate these AI recommendations into the workflow.""This is pretty new for us as a health care community, and I think we're all going to be wrestling with that question,"" he said.   CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER  Looking ahead, once the AI model has achieved the necessary regulatory approvals, GE HealthCare plans to make the technology available for widespread use by clinicians — perhaps even expanding to other care areas, such as neurology or cardiology.There is also the potential to incorporate it into drug development.""We don't want to miss anyone, but we also don't want to harm anyone.""   ""One of the things that drug makers struggle with is that some of the agents that may be really useful for some patients could be really toxic for others,"" Osterman said.""If they were able to pick which patients could go into a trial and exclude patients with the highest risk of toxicity, that could mean the difference between that drug being made available or not.""    CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  He added, ""If this means that we're able to help tailor that precision risk to patients, I'm in favor of that.""Ultimately, Osterman said, ""it's a really exciting time to be in medicine … I think we're going to look back and regard this as the golden age of AI recommendations. I think they're probably here to stay.""For more Health articles, visit www.foxnews/health.  Melissa Rudy is senior health editor and a member of the lifestyle team at Fox News Digital.

Immunotherapy, first approved in 2011, uses the cancer patient’s own immune system to target and fight cancer.&nbsp; While it doesn’t work for everyone, for the 15% to 20% who do see results, it can be life-saving. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Like any medication, immunotherapy has the potential for adverse side effects — which can be severe for some.&nbsp; Studies show that some 10% to 15% of patients develop ""significant toxicities.""  Headquartered in Chicago, GE HealthCare — working in tandem with Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) in Nashville, Tennessee — has created an AI model that's designed to help remove some of the uncertainties surrounding immunotherapy. Over the five years it’s been in development, the AI model was trained on thousands of patients’ electronic health records (EHRs) to recognize patterns in how they responded to immunotherapy, focusing on safety and effectiveness. AI MODEL COULD HELP PREDICT LUNG CANCER RISKS IN NON-SMOKERS, STUDY FINDS: ‘SIGNIFICANT ADVANCEMENT’ ""The model predicts which patients are likely to derive the benefit from immunotherapy versus those patients who may not,"" said Jan Wolber, global digital product leader at GE HealthCare’s pharmaceutical diagnostics segment, in an interview with Fox News Digital. ""It also predicts which patients have a likelihood of developing one or more significant toxicities."" When pulling data from the patient’s health record, the model looks at demographic information, preexisting diagnoses, lifestyle habits (such as smoking), medication history and more.  ""All of these data are already being collected by the patient’s oncologist, or they’re filling out a form in the waiting room ahead of time,"" said Travis Osterman, a medical oncologist and associate chief medical information officer at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, in an interview with Fox News Digital. (Osterman is working with Wolber on the development of the AI model.) BREAST CANCER BREAKTHROUGH: AI PREDICTS A THIRD OF CASES PRIOR TO DIAGNOSIS IN MAMMOGRAPHY STUDY ""We're not asking for additional blood samples or complex imaging. These are all data points that we're already collecting — vital signs, diagnoses, lab values, those sorts of things."" In a study, the AI model showed 70% to 80% accuracy in predicting patients’ responses to immunotherapies, according to an article published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology Clinical Cancer Informatics. ""While the models are not perfect, this is actually a very good result,"" Wolber said. ""We can implement those models with very little additional effort because there are no additional measurements required in the clinic."" ‘Natural progression’ This type of technology is ""a natural progression of what we've been doing in medicine for a very long time,"" Osterman said. ""The only difference is, instead of surveying patients, we're taking the entirety of the medical record and looking for risk factors that contribute to an outcome,"" he said in an interview with Fox News Digital.  With immunotherapy, there is generally a lower response rate than with chemotherapy, Osterman noted — but some patients have ""incredible responses"" and ultimately become cancer-free. ""I would be horrified to know that one of my patients that I didn't give immunotherapy to could have been one of the tremendous responders,"" he told Fox News Digital.&nbsp; Conversely, Osterman noted that in rare cases, immunotherapy can have some serious side effects. ""I would be horrified to know that one of my patients that I didn't give immunotherapy to could have been one of the tremendous responders."" ""I would say about half of patients don't have any side effects, but for those who do, some of them are really life-altering,"" he said.&nbsp; ""We don't want to miss anyone, but we also don't want to harm anyone."" At the core of the AI project, Osterman said, is the ability to ""put all the information into the exam room,"" so the oncologist can counsel the patient about the risks and benefits of this particular therapy and make the best, most informed decision about their care.&nbsp; Combining technology and human expertise Dr. Marc Siegel, clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and a Fox News medical contributor, was not involved in the AI model’s development but commented on its potential. ""AI models are emerging that are helping to manage responses to cancer treatments,"" he told Fox News Digital.&nbsp;  ""These can allow for more treatment options and be more predictive of outcome."" AI models like this one are an example of ""the essential future of personalized medicine,"" Siegel said, ""where each patient is approached differently and their cancer is analyzed and treated with precision using genetic and protein analysis."" As long as physicians and scientists remain in charge — ""not a computer or robot"" — Siegel said that ""there is no downside."" Potential limitations The AI model does carry some degree of limitations, the experts acknowledged. ""The models obviously do not return 100% accuracy,"" Wolber told Fox News Digital. ""So there are some so-called false positives or false negatives.""&nbsp; NEW AI ‘CANCER CHATBOT’ PROVIDES PATIENTS AND FAMILIES WITH 24/7 SUPPORT: 'EMPATHETIC APPROACH' The tool is not a ""black box"" that will provide a surefire answer, he noted. Rather, it's a tool that provides data points to the clinician and informs them as they make patient management decisions. Osterman pointed out that the AI model uses a ""relatively small dataset."" ""We would love to be able to refine our predictions by learning on bigger data sets,"" he said.  The team is currently looking for partnerships that will enable them to test the AI model in new settings and achieve even higher accuracy in its predictions.&nbsp; Another challenge, Osterman said, is the need to integrate these AI recommendations into the workflow. ""This is pretty new for us as a health care community, and I think we're all going to be wrestling with that question,"" he said.&nbsp; CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER Looking ahead, once the AI model has achieved the necessary regulatory approvals, GE HealthCare plans to make the technology available for widespread use by clinicians — perhaps even expanding to other care areas, such as neurology or cardiology. There is also the potential to incorporate it into drug development. ""We don't want to miss anyone, but we also don't want to harm anyone."" ""One of the things that drug makers struggle with is that some of the agents that may be really useful for some patients could be really toxic for others,"" Osterman said. ""If they were able to pick which patients could go into a trial and exclude patients with the highest risk of toxicity, that could mean the difference between that drug being made available or not."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP He added, ""If this means that we're able to help tailor that precision risk to patients, I'm in favor of that."" Ultimately, Osterman said, ""it's a really exciting time to be in medicine … I think we're going to look back and regard this as the golden age of AI recommendations. I think they're probably here to stay.""

Labor’s Principles on Use of Artificial Intelligence, Automation, and Technology in the Workplace

 April 11, 2024April 24, 2024 



Labor’s Principles on Use of Artificial Intelligence, Automation, and Technology in the Workplace
Labor has developed principles for the use of Artificial Intelligence, automation, and other technology in the workplace that can harness the potential to improve working conditions and make work safer and more productive.

There is nothing inevitable about AI technology. The future of workers, and the extent to which AI and other technology will displace workers or impact their work, should not be determined by tech companies. The Labor Movement defends the interests of all workers by challenging corporate interests’ push to replace people with robots. Truck drivers, bus drivers, janitors, construction workers, social workers, firefighters, and nurses are not replaceable, and our unions will stand together to protect good jobs and the quality services our members provide.
Workers must have control over the use of technology at work. There is no substitute for a collective bargaining agreement that allows workers to negotiate the uses of technology in the workplace. Regulation of AI, automated decision systems, automation, and other technologies should require that workers are part of the development, procurement, and deployment of technology at work. Technology should make work safer, more productive, and increase workers’ skills, not worsen conditions or eliminate jobs. The best way to do that is to treat technology, including AI, as a tool for workers to control, not that controls them.
Workers have a right to informed consent. Before implementing workplace technologies, workers should have the right to be notified of the technology, justification for its use, what data will be collected, and how it will be used. Workers must have the right to access and control the use of their data, especially when used to make employment decisions. Workers should control the use of their data, work product, and likeness whether used to train generative AI systems or to be used by third parties.
Human oversight is critical. New technology like AI is a powerful tool, but it is just a tool that needs human oversight. There must be a role for humans in making and overseeing all consequential workplace and employment decisions. This includes decisions that impact the public such as service provision, benefit eligibility, court proceedings, or other public programs. Automation, such as driverless vehicles, also must have human oversight with the ability to override if necessary. There are also some decisions that are too important for technology to be the sole decision-maker, such as for hiring, discipline, terminations, work quotas, or wage setting.
Prevent the abuse of technology. Technology has the power to mine our data and track and control our every move. Facial recognition, predictive behavioral analysis, profiling, and other surveillance technology should not be used on or off the job. This is especially important when it is used to profile or predict the likelihood of workers to organize or file complaints or be used to prevent workers from exercising their right to organize or other protected rights. Algorithmic management tools or quotas should never be allowed to require a worker to violate labor or health and safety laws. Technology should be tested and assessed before deployment to screen out the potential for abuse or law violations. The companies that train AI or other technology should be held liable when technology causes harm, violates the law, or has other adverse impacts.
There is dignity in work, and we must fight to protect good jobs. AI and other technology could potentially displace millions of workers. Technology policies should preserve jobs and avoid mass displacement of workers in the hopes that public programs will fill the gap.

Top 17 Tech Skills Growing in Value

Which tech skills are growing in value? That’s a crucial question for tech professionals who want to maximize their pay and focus their learning time on skills and tools that will pay off.

Analyst firm Foote Partners has just updated its IT Skills Demand and Pay Trends Report (ITSDPT) and IT Skills and Certifications Pay Volatility Index. Many non-certified tech skills earned a pay premium above their base salary equivalent, as well as a market value increase over the past six months. That’s good news for many who work in tech—but which skills saw the biggest increase?

Fortunately, we have a chart:  

For those unfamiliar with the term “MLOps,” it’s “machine learning operations,” or the workflows and techniques associated with machine learning projects. As you might suspect, it has a lot in common with DevOps, which is a set of methodologies and tools that allow organizations to efficiently built and deploy software and apps. 

The other skills on this list lean heavily into data and artificial intelligence (A.I.). If you specialize in anything from prompt engineering to deep learning, there’s demand for your skills, and you can likely leverage that for superior compensation. It’s also helpful to keep in mind that more A.I.-related jobs are coming online: Last month, CompTIA classified 65,241 jobs as “emerging tech,” and 19,100 of those involved artificial intelligence in some way (either as the job itself, or heavily relying on artificial intelligence skills). 

Even if you’re not interested in a job that focuses on A.I., a plethora of tech jobs are integrating A.I. and data tools into their respective workflows. 

If you’re interested in learning more about A.I. on your own, many online courses can help. For example, online learning portals such as Coursera have instructional modules from the likes of DeepLearning.AI, IBM, Vanderbilt University, and other institutions. For those who want a certificate to slap on a resume, Udacity also offers a generative A.I. “nanodegree” program, with a focus on skills such as the OpenAI API, image pre-processing, and more; prerequisite skills include Python, neural networks, and more. Those interested in generative A.I. can turn to Google, which has multiple online tutorials and videos exploring that technology. 
Working effectively in A.I. also involves transferrable skills such as critical thinking and a commitment to continuous learning (essential when you consider how fast this technology is evolving). If you have these skills, you may already be well on your way to a career in A.I., even if you haven’t yet learned the right techniques and tools.

In the rapidly evolving landscape of technology, the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has sparked both awe and apprehension. While hailed for its potential to revolutionize industries and streamline processes, there’s a growing concern that AI could pose a significant threat to employment generation. This sentiment has ignited a fervent debate among experts and policymaker’s worldwide. Proponents of AI argue that it has the capacity to enhance productivity, efficiency, and innovation across various sectors. From automated manufacturing processes to intelligent customer service systems, AI applications promise to streamline operations and unlock new avenues for growth. Advocates often highlight the potential for AI to create new job opportunities, particularly in specialized fields such as data science, machine learning, and robotics.   However, amidst the optimism, skeptics raise valid concerns about the darker implications of widespread AI adoption. One of the most pressing apprehensions revolves around the displacement of human labour by intelligent machines. As AI systems become increasingly sophisticated, there’s a looming threat that they could render certain jobs obsolete, leading to widespread unemployment and economic upheaval. The manufacturing industry serves as a poignant example of this phenomenon. With the rise of automated assembly lines and robotic technologies, traditional manufacturing roles have dwindled, leaving many workers displaced. Similar trends are observed across various sectors, including retail, transportation, and customer service, where AI-powered solutions are increasingly replacing human workers.   Moreover, the integration of AI into white-collar professions is raising concerns about the future of knowledge-based jobs. Advanced algorithms and machine learning algorithms are increasingly capable of performing tasks that were once exclusive to human intellect, such as data analysis, legal research, and even creative endeavors like content generation. This shift poses a significant challenge for workers whose livelihoods depend on cognitive skills and expertise. Critics caution that unless proactive measures are taken to address the potential socio-economic ramifications of AI, the widening gap between technological advancement and employment opportunities could exacerbate inequality and social unrest. As AI continues to reshape the labour market, policymakers face the daunting task of navigating the delicate balance between innovation and job preservation.   In response to these challenges, calls for comprehensive strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of AI on employment are gaining traction. Investing in education and training is paramount for preparing individuals for an AI-driven economy. This involves prioritizing lifelong learning programs that impart technical skills like data science and programming, as well as nurturing critical thinking, adaptability, and creativity. By prioritizing education, societies can ensure their workforce remains agile and equipped to navigate the evolving landscape of work. Reskilling and up skilling initiatives are vital to help workers transition into new roles that complement AI technologies. Governments and businesses should invest in tailored programs catering to diverse industries and demographics, ensuring inclusivity and preventing anyone from being left behind due to automation. Empowering individuals through reskilling and up skilling opportunities enables them to adapt to changing job requirements and seize new employment prospects.   Ethical AI deployment and robust social safety nets are essential components in shaping a future where AI augments human capabilities while safeguarding against negative impacts on employment. Establishing ethical guidelines and regulatory frameworks ensures responsible AI deployment, mitigating unintended consequences like bias and discrimination. Implementing social safety nets such as universal basic income and healthcare coverage provides support for workers facing job displacement, fostering economic stability and facilitating retraining for alternative employment opportunities. Embracing these strategies fosters a culture of innovation, inclusivity, and social responsibility, leading to a more resilient and equitable society for all.   As the debate over the impact of AI on employment rages on, one thing remains clear: the need for a proactive and inclusive approach to harnessing the potential of this transformative technology. While AI undoubtedly holds the promise of unparalleled progress, its implications for the future of work must be carefully considered to ensure a sustainable and equitable society in the age of automation. Thus, the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents both immense opportunities and significant challenges for employment generation. While AI has the potential to enhance productivity and innovation across various sectors, there are legitimate concerns about its impact on job displacement and economic inequality.   To navigate this complex landscape, proactive measures such as investing in education, reskilling initiatives, ethical AI deployment, and robust social safety nets are crucial. By embracing these strategies, societies can harness the transformative power of AI while ensuring a sustainable and inclusive future for all in the age of automation.     (Author is a Ph.D Scholar, University of Kashmir.

The new operating system is likely to be unveiled at the company's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), and is expected to arrive with the latest iPhone 16 in September.Also Read | Apple removes Meta's WhatsApp, Threads from iOS store as China flags security concernsAccording to Bloomberg's Mark Gurnman, Apple is developing a large language model (LLM) that will be entirely on-device, meaning it will powered by the processor inside the phone instead of being run from the cloud. The use of the ‘on-device’ model for powering generative AI features on iOS 18 should result in a reduction in response time, make it easier for Apple to maintain privacy and may even run offline or in places with low internet connectivity.However, on-device LLMs are not backed by huge servers with billions of parameters (which power most commercial chatbots like ChatGPT or Gemini) and as a result, are less powerful and knowledgeable in many cases. The Bloomberg report does state though that Apple could partner with Google, OpenAI or other providers in order to mitigate some of these issues.&nbsp;Gurnman also states that Apple could use a different marketing strategy for its AI features than the competition by stating how these tools help in improving the daily lives of users.&nbsp;Also Read | Apple pitches its $3,500 Vision Pro headset to businesses. Will it catch on?Notably, Apple has reportedly been in touch with companies like OpenAI and Google to improve the quality of AI features in iOS 18. However, Gurnman states that Apple's initial AI features will not be superior to the competition but the Cupertino-based tech giant's implementation of these tools could be a ‘game changer’.While modern smartphones are equipped with specialized components like AI processors, executing complex algorithms directly on the device remains a formidable task. This complexity is highlighted by Samsung's approach, where users are given the option to choose between running certain AI features locally or leveraging server-based processing.&nbsp;&nbsp;",,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'cssSelector': ['h1', '.summary h2']}",,,,,,,,en,iPhone 16's generative AI features likely to work ‘entirely on-device’: Here's what we know so far | Mint

Last Updated Apr 21, 2024 07:01:13 AM.




OTTAWA — Worried artificial intelligence is coming for your job? So is the federal government — enough, at least, to set aside $50 million for skills retraining for workers. 
One of the centrepiece promises in the federal budget released Tuesday was $2.3 billion in investments aiming to boost adoption of the technology and the artificial intelligence industry in Canada.
But tucked alongside that was a promise to invest $50 million over four years “to support workers who may be impacted by AI.” Workers in “potentially disrupted sectors and communities” will receive new skills training through the Sectoral Workforce Solutions Program.
“There is a significant transformation of the economy and society on the horizon around artificial intelligence,” said Joel Blit, an associate professor of economics at the University of Waterloo.
Some jobs will be lost, others will be created, “but there’s going to be a transition period that could be somewhat chaotic.”
While jokes about robots coming to take jobs predate the emergence of generative AI systems in late 2022, the widespread availability of systems like ChatGPT made those fears real for many, even as workers across industries began integrating the technology into their workday.
In June 2023, a briefing note for Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland warned the impact of generative AI “will be felt across all industries and around 40 per cent of all working hours could be impacted.”
“Banking, insurance and energy appear to have higher potential for automation compared to other sectors,” says the note, obtained through access to information and citing information from Accenture. 
“This could have substantial impacts on jobs and skills requirements.”
The budget only singles out “creative industries” as an affected sector that will be covered by the program. In February, the Canadian TV, film, and music industries asked MPs for protection against AI, saying the tech threatens their livelihood and reputations.
Finance Canada did not respond to questions asking what other sectors or types of jobs would be covered under the program. 
“The creative industries was used as an illustrative example, and not intended as an exclusion of other affected areas,” deputy Finance spokesperson Caroline Thériault said in a statement. 
In an interview earlier this year, Bea Bruske, president of the Canadian Labour Congress, said unions representing actors and directors have been very worried about how their likenesses or their work could be used by AI systems. But the “reality is that we have to look at the implication of AI in all jobs,” she said. 
Blit explained large language models and other generative AI can write, come up with new ideas and then test those ideas, analyze data, as well as generate computer programming code, music, images, and video.
Those set to be affected are individuals in white-collar professions, like people working in marketing, health care, law and accounting.
In the longer run, “it’s actually quite hard to predict who is going to be impacted,” he said. “What’s going to happen is that entire industries, entire processes are going to be reimagined around this new technology.”
AI is an issue “across sectors, but certainly clerical and customer service jobs are more vulnerable,” Hugh Pouliot, a spokesperson for the Canadian Union of Public Employees, said in an email.
The federal government has used AI in nearly 300 projects and initiatives, new research published earlier this month revealed.
According to Viet Vu, manager of economic research at Toronto Metropolitan University’s the Dais, the impact of AI on workers in a sector like the creative industry doesn’t have to be negative. 
“That’s only the case if you adopt it irresponsibly,” he said, pointing out creative professionals have been adopting new digital tools in their work for years. 
He noted only four per cent of Canadian businesses are using any kind of artificial intelligence or machine learning. “And so we’re really not there yet for these frontier models and frontier technologies” to be making an impact. 
When it comes to the question of how AI will affect the labour market, it’s more useful to think about what types of tasks technology can do better, as opposed to whether it will replace entire jobs, Vu said. 
“A job is composed of so many different tasks that sometimes even if a new technology comes along and 20, 30 per cent of your job can be done using AI, you still have that 60, 70 per cent left,” he said.
“So it’s rare that (an) entire occupation is actually sort of erased out of existence because of technology.”
Finance Canada also did not respond to questions about what new skills the workers would be learning.
Vu said there are two types of skills it makes sense to focus on in retraining — computational thinking, or understanding how computers operate and make decisions, and skills dealing with data. 
There is no AI system in the world that does not use data, he said. “And so being able to actually understand how data is curated, how data is used, even some basic data analytics skills, will go a really long way.”
But given the scope of the change the AI technology is set to trigger, critics say a lot more than $50 million will be necessary.
Blit said the money is a good first step but won’t be “close to enough” when it comes to the scale of the coming transformation, which will be comparable to globalization or the adoption of computers.
Valerio De Stefano, Canada research chair in innovation law and society at York University, agreed more resources will be necessary. 
“Jobs may be reduced to an extent that reskilling may be insufficient,” and the government should look at “forms of unconditional income support such as basic income,” he said. 
The government should also consider demanding AI companies “contribute directly to pay for any social initiative that takes care of people who lose their jobs to technology” and asking “employers who reduce payrolls and increase profits thanks to AI to do the same.”
“Otherwise, society will end up subsidizing tech businesses and other companies as they increase profit without giving back enough for technology to benefit us all.”
