Such is the nature of an economy continuously influenced by new technology, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises to transform the workplace once again.

But while some herald in the AI revolution with unbridled enthusiasm, excited by the opportunities and enriching work it could create, others are more pessimistic. However, both parties agree that AI has widespread application, from automating routine tasks to making complex decisions instantly. The debate is not so much about the power of the technology itself – all agree it’s revolutionary - but rather the role of the people that will work alongside it.
PROMOTED
Either way, experts all agree that the workplace is about to change forever. Here are two ways that AI will change careers for young professionals.
Optimists say AI will create more jobs

A study of 1,000 companies revealed that AI systems created new jobs in 80% of the organizations they were implemented in. In fact, a 2017 Gartner report predicts that  AI will create 500,000 more jobs than it will displace over the next three years, ushering a slew of employment opportunities for medium-to high-skilled workers.
As the global economy gears up for the widespread adoption of AI solutions, competition grows fierce for employees with the scarce skills required to implement, manage and work alongside this new technology. Developing these skills is therefore vital for any young professional wishing to remain relevant in an increasingly automated workplace.

And as this skilled workforce drives the AI industry forward at an accelerated pace, the demand for even more highly trained professionals will grow alongside it. This will result in a workplace comprising of adaptable people - according to Gartner - whose jobs are reimagined, enriched or facilitated by the technology they work alongside.
While it’s true that many low-skill jobs will fall by the wayside, replaced by the sophisticated automation AI enables, new careers and industries will emerge that haven’t been invented yet. Just as our parents struggled to predict the emergence of fields like social media or blogging, so, too, are we incapable of comprehending the jobs AI will create.
Pessimists say AI will replace workers completely
In contrast to this optimistic view, Gallup suggests that  Millennials are the most vulnerable generation to the threats AI poses, with 37% of Millennials being at risk of redundancy. But redundancy isn’t just a short-term problem for young professionals. A McKinsey report states that half of today’s work activities could be automated by 2055, or in more extreme scenarios, up to 20 years earlier.
The relative job security of older generations (only 32% are at risk of redundancy) is in part due to the senior positions they hold within their companies. After all, it’s easier to replace somebody in the infancy of their career rather than replace entire branches of management or executive leadership. Not to mention that it’s often these senior staff members who are in charge of decisions surrounding AI implementation in the first place, and they’re unlikely to replace themselves.
How then can young professionals prepare for this wave of unprecedented redundancy? Optimistically, only low-level, repetitive tasks will be automated in the near future. This means that Millennials with developed and adaptable problem-solving and decision-making skills can insulate themselves from the immediate threat of redundancy, and aim to work alongside AI in more senior management positions over the long term.
Pessimistically, widespread redundancy is unavoidable and will usher in a new philosophy regarding the role of human work in society. If machines are able to perform cognitive functions that were previously too difficult to automate successfully, no jobs are safe.
Theorists suggest a universal basic income as a solution, whereby governments provide their citizens with a living wage to combat their inability to secure employment. And while hotly contested, pilots are already under way in Finland.
Key takeaway
Artificial Intelligence is still in its infancy, and is yet to reach the point of mass adoption. As such it’s difficult to predict the extent to which it will redefine the workplace or the jobs of the young professionals within it.
The most likely scenario, however, is a combination of both the optimistic and pessimistic views. An economy that prizes highly-skilled, well-trained, and adaptable employees who work alongside very smart machines. And a large segment of low-skilled workers whose skills are made redundant at an alarming rate.
While we can appeal to the better nature of organizations to nurture and prepare their staff for an inevitable technological transition, Millennials should heed the warning signs, take initiative, and equip themselves with the skills needed to survive a potentially tumultuous economic evolution.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Daniel MarlinI'm a managing partner of SOMS Consulting, a firm that designs business processes and software to make companies a pleasure to manage.

Congratulations are in order. You, yes you, dear reader, have been part of something incredible. Thanks to your hard work, millions of books containing pretty much the sum-total of human knowledge have been successfully digitised, saving their texts for future generations. All because of you.No, seriously.You know how occasionally you’ll be prompted with a “Captcha” when filling out a form on the internet, to prove that you’re fully human? Behind the scenes of one of the most popular Captcha systems - Google’s Recaptcha - your humanoid clicks have been helping figure out things that traditional computing just can’t manage, and in the process you’ve been helping to train Google’s AI to be even smarter.Sponsored LinksSponsored LinksPromoted LinksPromoted LinksSherumThis New AC Cooler Cools the Room In SecondsSherumLearn MoreUndoAnd you thought you were merely logging into some website or other.LATEST VIDEOS FROM techradar

OriginsRecaptcha (or “reCATCHA” if you prefer) started out as a collaboration by a number of computer scientists at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, first released in 2007 - and it was quickly snaffled up by Google in 2009. The premise was as described above: by marrying up users who need to prove they are human to data that needs transcribing, both sides get something out of it.So instead of digitising books by having one person carry out the very boring task of typing or checking a whole book manually, instead millions of people can unknowingly collaborate to achieve the same goal. Remember how it always used to be two words you had to enter? Conceivably, only one was the “real” test, and the other was a new word that was yet to be transcribed - but as the user you wouldn’t know which was which, so you’d have to attempt to do both accurately.The Google Books app on Android. Recaptcha can even check its own work. By showing the same words to multiple users, it can automatically verify that a word has been transcribed correctly by comparing multiple attempts from multiple users across the world.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Amazingly, thanks to Recaptcha boxes appearing on thousands of major websites and receiving tens of millions of completions a day, by 2011 Recaptcha had finished digitising the entire Google Books archive - as well as 13 million articles from the New York Times back-catalogue dating back to 1851.So what did Google do next, with no books left to digitise? In what was perhaps a happy coincidence, this coincided with the growth of artificial intelligence and machine learning.Training montageIn 2012, Google started including not just words, but snippets of photos from Google Street View - making users transcribe door numbers and other signage. And in 2014, the system became all about training AI.Essentially, the way machine learning works is that you hand the machine a bunch of data that is already sorted - say, a bunch of images of cats that you have tagged as cats, and then it uses this information to build a neural network that enables it to pick the cats out of other images. The more pictures of cats that you feed it, the more accurate the AI becomes at picking out cats from other images.A cat. Just in case you weren't sure. Google has countless reasons to want to train AI to recognise objects in images: better Google Image Search results, more accurate Google Maps results, and enabling you to search your Google Photos library for all of the photos you have taken of a specific object or place. Oh, and the small matter of making sure that your driverless car doesn’t hit anything. You know when Recaptcha asks you to identify street signs? Essentially you’re playing a very small role in piloting a driverless car somewhere, at some point in the future.So it is hugely convenient then that Google has as its disposal hundreds of millions of internet users to work for it: by using Recaptcha to tackle these problems, Google can use our need to prove we’re human to force us to use our very human intuitions to build its database.Google's Waymo driverless car system. This is why currently, instead of simply throwing up some text, Recaptcha is giving users more image-related tasks: “Click all of the images of cats”, “Click all of the boxes on the grid overlaying an image that contain a cat”, and so on. For thousands of different objects.This is a particularly useful asset for Google, as it competes with other internet giants to grow its machine learning datasets and algorithms: The more data it can analyse, the better results will be - giving its current and future products a competitive advantage.Using AI to beat AIAmusingly, there is only one problem with using captchas to train machine learning algorithms. What’s to stop, for example, people who want to get around captchas from using machine learning against captchas?Last year developer Francis Kim built a proof of concept means to beat Recaptcha by using Google’s machine learning abilities against it. In just 40 lines of Javascript, he was able to build a system that uses the rival Clarifai image recognition API to look at the images Google’s Recaptcha throws up, and identify the objects the captcha requires. So if Recaptcha demands the user select images of storefronts to prove their humanity, Clarifai is able to pick them out instead.Conceivably too, this sort of thing would also be possible using Google’s own technology. Because Google wants to sell its clever tech to other companies, it opens TensorFlow up to developers through an API itself. This means that you could conceivably use TensorFlow to trick the Captcha that trains TensorFlow. This wouldn’t work 100% of the time - but once an AI is sufficiently well trained, it should be able to do the trick in a large number of cases.What’s clear from Recaptcha is not just that it is an ingenious idea, but also that thanks to our hard work, it is getting increasingly difficult to separate us humans from the machines.TechRadar's AI Week is brought to you in association with Honor.

Not only have humans spent decades of research perfecting the mathematical calculations to make these wonderfully complex learning algorithms work but during this time we have looked further than our own species as inspiration to make the next generation of intelligent presence on our planet. Mother Nature, and all that it encompasses, has it’s roots firmly planted in the workings of Artificial Intelligence — and it’s here to stay.Aren’t Sir David Attenborough’s wildlife documentaries just incredible? They go into incredible, high definition detail about the behaviours and properties of the Earth’s many inhabitants, and they allow us to understand how they fit into the natural ecosystem and work together in order to allow our planet to flourish — to make it Earth. Now I’m no Sir David Attenborough, but I’m still going to take you on a wildlife documentary of my own. The star creatures in question are none other than those Artificial Intelligence algorithms that are inspired directly by Mother Nature’s own. But first, I need to introduce you to two algorithm concepts. Search/Pathfinding and Predictive Modelling.SEARCH (PATHFINDING) ALGORITHMSSearch algorithms are essentially programs that are designed to find the best/shortest route to an objective. For example, the travelling salesman problem is a typical search optimisation issue where you are given a list of cities and distances between those cities. You must search for the shortest route for the travelling salesman, whilst visiting each city once to minimise travel time and expenditure (ensuring that you return to the origin city). Real world applications of this problem are delivery trucks. Imagine 100 people in London made an online order and all the boxes are loaded into one van. The courier (let’s say…DPD), must now calculate the most efficient route (balancing distance/time taken) to deliver those packages from the depot (eventually returning to the depot) to ensure that the company is wasting as little time and money as it can during the delivery process.PREDICTIVE MODELLING ALGORITHMSToday, predictive modelling is where all the hype is. Data Scientists everywhere are shouting ‘Neural Networks!’ from the rooftops of their cosy office buildings and companies like Google are running around trying to solve the world’s problems with different variations of these complex little ‘artificial brains’. Essentially predictive modelling uses statistics in order to predict outcomes. You often hear Data Scientists attempting to solve two kinds of predictive modelling problems, Regression and Classification. Regression is the dark art of finding the correlation between two sets of variables, and classification is the process of determining the probability of a dataset belonging to a different set.5 BIOLOGICALLY-INSPIRED LEARNING ALGORITHMS1. ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKSFeed Forward Neural Network — the most basic type of Neural Network.Algorithm Type: Predictive ModellingBiological Inspiration: Cognitive Brain Function (Neurons)Use-cases: Sentiment Analysis, Image Recognition/Detection, Language Correction, RoboticsLet’s start with the most commonly known Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm of them all. Neural Networks are part of a sub-category of AI called Machine Learning. They have been designed and built to mimic brain function on a Neuron level, interacting with Axons and Dendrites in order to pass information through a system to generate a predictive output through a series of ‘layers’. Each layer provides an extra layer of data representation and allows you to model most complex problems.Neural Networks are probably the most widely used Machine Learning algorithms and is the hottest trend in Data Science and Machine Learning to date. The concept initially came to fruition in 1958, known as the Perceptron, later refined by Geoffrey Hinton and popularised by companies such as Google and Facebook. Neural Networks can be used to solve a wide range of problem types including Natural Language Processing, and Visual recognition. This supervised learning algorithm can support both Regression and Classification problems and examples of its use can be found in regular consumer products including smartphones, and connected home devices.2. GENETIC ALGORITHMSReproduction of individuals in a Genetic AlgorithmAlgorithm Type: Search/PathfindingBiological Inspiration: Survival of the Fittest/Evolution (Cell Reproduction)Use-cases: Data Mining/Analytics, Robotics, Manufacturing/Design, Process OptimisationGenetic algorithms take a ‘survival of the fittest’, evolutionary-like approach among a series of individuals over consecutive generations in order to solve a search problem. Each generation contains a population of strings that mimic chromosomes that we see in our DNA. Each individual within a population represents a point within the search space, therefore each is a possible candidate solution. In order to improve the population of solutions, we put the individuals through a process of evolution.Each individual in the population will compete for resources and mates.The individuals most successful in each competition will (often) produce more individuals than those that perform poorly.Genes from more ‘ideal’ candidates propagate through the population so those good parents will often produce offspring with even greater potential.3. SWARM/COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCEExample of Ant Colony Optimisation — a type of collective intelligence algorithm.Algorithm Type: Search/PathfindingBiological Inspiration: Ant Colonies/Schools of Fish/Flocks of BirdsUse-cases: Robotics, Video Game AI, Manufacturing, Route PlanningAnt Colony Optimisation and Particle Swarm Optimisation are the two most commonly known algorithms that conform to the bounds of the ‘collective intelligence’ concept. On a basic level, the algorithms in question all utilise multiple working agents. Each working agent exhibits very basic behaviour that collectively (as a pack) works together to bring out more complex, emergent behaviour in order to solve the problem.Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) is very different to Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO). Both aim to achieve emergent behaviour but go about it in two different ways. Like real ant colonies, ACO utilises a pheromone scent to guide individual agents onto the shortest path. Initially, a random pheromone is initialised across the problem space. Individual agents will begin to traverse the search space, dropping pheromone scent as they go. Throughout each time-step, the pheromone will decay at a defined rate. Single Agents make their decisions based on the strength of pheromone scent in front of them in order to traverse the search space. The stronger the scent in a particular direction, the more likely it is to travel that way. The best-known solution will end up being the one with the strongest pheromone scent.PSO looks more to the overall direction of the pack. A number of single agents are initialised and they begin in random directions. At each time step, each agent needs to make a decision on whether or not to change direction. The decision will be based on the direction of the best-known solution (known as pbest/global best), the direction of the best nearest neighbour (local best), and the current direction of travel. The new direction of travel is typically a good ‘compromise’ of all these values.4. REINFORCEMENT LEARNINGAgent Behaviour within a Reinforcement Learning Environment.Algorithm Type: Predictive ModellingBiological Inspiration: Classical ConditioningUse-cases: Video Games, Controlling Autonomous Vehicles, Manufacturing Line Software, Financial SystemsWith groundings in psychology and a process reminiscent of classical conditioning, Reinforcement Learning (RL) supports the idea of providing a positive numerical response to a favourable action taken by an agent. Learning the concept of Reinforcement Learning is often easier when compared to the popular classical conditioning example; Pavlov’s Dogs. It was a piece of research conducted in the 1890’s where Russian Psychologist Ivan Pavlov was looking at the salivation in dogs in response to being fed. An excellent article explaining the matter can be found here. Essentially, if an RL agent takes a good action, one that makes a step towards completing the task required, it is given a numerical reward. The agent will learn using a policy — for example; to maximise the reward given at each individual step. The application of raw inputs into the algorithm allows the agent to develop its own sense of the problem, and how to solve it in the most efficient manner.It is common to see RL algorithms paired with other Machine Learning technologies — such as Neural Networks. This is often referred to as Deep Reinforcement Learning. Neural Networks are often used to estimate the reward given to an RL agent when it makes a particular decision. Deep Mind, now a Google company, has made great progress within this space, using a Deep Q Learning approach to tacking more generic problems (such as the ability for one algorithm to play an entire library of Atari games, unassisted and beat the World Champion itself at the game ‘Go’. They are now adapting this approach to be able to tackle more complex games such as Starcraft II.For reference, Q Learning is a model-free version of the Reinforcement Learning algorithm. It can be used to find the optimal action-selection policy for any finite Markov Decision Process. Upon program initialisation, the Q values for each action-value pair are defined by the developer and updated by the RL algorithm at each time step. The following image is an example of the equation to update the Q action-value pair.Q Learning Value Update Equation5. ARTIFICIAL IMMUNE SYSTEMSComponents of an Artificial Immune SystemAlgorithm Type: Predictive ModellingBiological Inspiration: Immune SystemsUse-cases: Security Software, Autonomous Navigation Systems, Scheduling Systems, Fault Detection SoftwareAn immune system is a system that protects the body against substances and pathogenic organisms by producing an immune response. Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) are adaptive systems, inspired by theoretical immunology and observed immune functions that are applied to problem-solving. AIS is a subfield of biologically-inspired computing and natural computation with links to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. There are multiple algorithms commonly associated with AIS:Clonal SelectionDendritic CellNegative SelectionArtificial Immune RecognitionLike the biological immune system, AIS is able to categorise all ‘cell’s within a system as ‘self’ or ‘non-self’ cells. A distributed task force of intelligence is used to take action upon all cells. The two most important types of cells involved in immunisation are B-cells and T-cells (white blood cells to you and me). T-cells come in three types; one type to activate B-cells, one type to bind to and destroy foreign invaders and a final type to suppress auto-immune issues. B-cells are responsible for producing antibodies which are specific proteins that bind to an antigen — a toxic/foreign substance. Artificial Immune Systems are often used to defend against cyber attacks by monitoring intrusion detection and are often integrated into enterprise-grade software. Unlike the other algorithms mentioned in this article, free online learning material on this subject is very limited and is likely the least-developed.LET’S WRAP UP…So I’ve given 5 examples of how Mother Nature inspires our research and enhances our technology.

When I introduce myself as a data scientist, I often get questions like “What’s the difference between that and machine learning?” or “Does that mean you work on artificial intelligence?” I have responded enough times that my answer easily qualifies for my “rule of three”:






The fields do have a great deal of overlap, and there is enough hype around each of them that the choice can feel like a matter of marketing. But they are not interchangeable: most professionals in these fields have an intuitive understanding of how particular work could be classified as data science, machine learning (ML), or artificial intelligence (AI), even if it is difficult to put into words.So in this post, I’m proposing an oversimplified definition of the difference between the three fields:Data science produces insightsMachine learning produces predictionsArtificial intelligence produces actionsTo be clear, this isn’t a sufficient qualification: not everything that fits each definition is a part of that field. (A fortune teller makes predictions, but we would never say that they are doing machine learning.) These also aren’t a good way of determining someone’s role or job title (“Am I a data scientist?”), which is a matter of focus and experience. (This is true of any job description: I write as part of my job but I’m not a professional writer).But I think this definition is a useful way to distinguish the three types of work, and to avoid sounding silly when you are talking about it. It is worth noting that I’m taking a descriptivist rather than a prescriptivist approach: I’m not interested in what these terms “should mean,” but rather how people in the field typically use them.Data Science Produces InsightsData science is distinguished from the other two fields because its goal is an especially human one: to gain insight and understanding. Again, not everything that produces insights qualifies as data science (the classic definition of data science is that it involves a combination of statistics, software engineering, and domain expertise). But we can use this definition to distinguish it from ML and AI.The main distinction is that in data science there is always a human in the loop: someone is understanding the insight, seeing the figure, or benefitting from the conclusion. It would make no sense to say “Our chess-playing algorithm uses data science to choose its next move,” or “Google Maps uses data science to recommend driving directions.”This definition of data science thus emphasizes:Statistical inferenceData visualizationExperiment designDomain knowledgeCommunicationData scientists might use simple tools: they could report percentages and make line graphs based on SQL queries. They could also use very complex methods: they might work with distributed data stores to analyze trillions of records, develop cutting-edge statistical techniques, and build interactive visualizations. Whatever they use, the goal is to gain a better understanding of their data.Machine Learning Produces PredictionsI think of machine learning as the field of prediction: of “Given instance X with particular features, predict Y about it.” These predictions could be about the future, but they also could be about qualities that aren’t immediately obvious to a computer. Almost all Kaggle competitions qualify as machine learning problems: they offer some training data, and then see if competitors can make accurate predictions about new examples.There’s plenty of overlap between data science and machine learning. For example, logistic regression can be used to draw insights about relationships (“the richer a user is the more likely they’ll buy our product, so we should change our marketing strategy”) and to make predictions (“this user has a 53% chance of buying our product, so we should suggest it to them”).Models like random forests have slightly less interpretability and are more likely to fit the “machine learning” description, and methods such as deep learning are notoriously challenging to explain. This could get in the way if your goal is to extract insights rather than make predictions. We could thus imagine a “spectrum” of data science and machine learning, with more interpretable models leaning toward the data science side and more “black box” models on the machine learning side.Most practitioners will switch back and forth between the two tasks very comfortably. I use both machine learning and data science in my work: I might fit a model on Stack Overflow traffic data to determine which users are likely to be looking for a job (machine learning), but then construct summaries and visualizations that examine why the model works (data science). This is an important way to discover flaws in your model, and to combat algorithmic bias. This is one reason that data scientists are often responsible for developing machine learning components of a product.Artificial Intelligence Produces ActionsArtificial intelligence is by far the oldest and the most widely recognized of these three designations, and as a result it’s the most challenging to define. The term is surrounded by a great deal of hype, thanks to researchers, journalists, and startups who are looking for money or attention. This has led to a backlash that strikes me as unfortunate, since it means some work that probably should be called AI isn’t described as such.Some researchers have even complained about the AI effect: “AI is whatever we can’t do yet.” (It doesn’t help that AI is often conflated with general AI, capable of performing tasks across many different domains, or even superintelligent AI, which surpasses human intelligence. This sets unrealistic expectations for any system described as “AI.”)So what work can we fairly describe as AI?One common thread in definitions of AI is that an autonomous agent executes or recommends actions (e.g., Poole, Mackworth and Goebel 1998, Russell and Norvig 2003). Some systems I think should be described as AI include:Game-playing algorithms (Deep Blue, AlphaGo)Robotics and control theory (motion planning, walking a bipedal robot)Optimization (Google Maps choosing a route)Natural language processing (Bots - by “bots” here I’m referring to systems meant to interpret natural language and then respond in kind. This can be distinguished from text mining, where the goal is to extract insights (data science) or text classification, where the goal is to categorize documents (machine learning)Reinforcement learningAgain, we can see a lot of overlap with the other fields. But there are also distinctions. If I analyze some sales data and discover that clients from particular industries renew more than others (extracting an insight), the output is some numbers and graphs, not a particular action. (Executives might use those conclusions to change our sales strategy, but that action isn’t autonomous.) This means I would describe my work as data science: it would be cringeworthy to say that I’m “using AI to improve our sales.”The difference between AI and ML is a bit more subtle, and historically ML has often been considered a subfield of AI (computer vision in particular was a classic AI problem). But I think the ML field has largely “broken off” from AI, partly because of the backlash described above: most people who choose to work on problems of prediction don’t like to describe themselves as AI researchers. (It helped that many important ML breakthroughs came from statistics, which had less of a presence in the rest of the AI field). This means that if you can describe a problem as “predict X from Y,” I’d recommend avoiding the term AI completely.Case Study: How Would the Three Be Used Together?Suppose we were building a self-driving car, and were working on the specific problem of stopping at stop signs. We would need skills drawn from all three of these fields.MI: The car has to recognize a stop sign using its cameras. We construct a dataset of millions of photos of streetside objects, and train an algorithm to predict which have stop signs in them.AI: Once our car can recognize stop signs, it needs to decide when to take the action of applying the brakes. It’s dangerous to apply them too early or too late, and we need it to handle varying road conditions (for example, to recognize on a slippery road that it is not slowing down quickly enough), which is a problem of control theory.Data science: In street tests we find that the car’s performance isn’t good enough, with some false negatives in which it drives right by a stop sign. After analyzing the street test data, we gain the insight that the rate of false negatives depends on the time of day: it is more likely to miss a stop sign before sunrise or after sunset. We realize that most of our training data included only objects in full daylight, so we construct a better dataset including nighttime images and go back to the machine learning step.David Robinson is a data scientist at Stack Overflow, and works in R and Python.

These and many other fascinating insights are from Stanford University’s inaugural AI Index (PDF, no opt-in, 101 pp.). Stanford has undertaken a One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence (AI100) looking at the effects of AI on people’s lives, basing the inaugural report and index on the initial findings. The study finds “that we’re essentially “flying blind” in our conversations and decision-making related to Artificial Intelligence.” The AI Index is focused on tracking activity and progress on AI initiatives, and to facilitate informed conversations grounded with reliable, verifiable data. All data used to produce the AI Index and report is available at aiindex.org. Please see the AI Index for additional details regarding the methodology used to create each of the following graphs.

The following ten charts from the AI Index report provides insights into AI’s rapid growth:

The number of Computer Science academic papers and studies has soared by more than 9X since 1996. Academic studies and research are often the precursors to new intellectual property and patents. The entire Scopus database contains over 200,000 (200,237) papers in the field of Computer Science that have been indexed with the key term “Artificial Intelligence.” The Scopus database contains almost 5 million (4,868,421) papers in the subject area “Computer Science.”

Artificial intelligence and machine learning are eating up workloads at IT help desks, in cybersecurity, and other IT tasks, stirring significant concern over the long-term impact AI will have on jobs — even in the IT industry.
And the concern isn’t unfounded. According to a recent report from Tata Consulting Services, in 12 out of the 13 major industry verticals, IT is the most frequent user of AI, with more than 46 percent of IT organizations at large corporations incorporating AI into their work portfolios.
But that doesn’t mean IT jobs are about to go the way of telephone switchboard operators. Instead, the day-to-day activities of enterprise technology professionals will evolve alongside AI and new skills may be required.

The staff had difficulty keeping up with the round-the-clock needs of the company and handling emergencies, says Whigham.So, in early 2016, the company launched a major transformation to provide better self-service options, and to be able to scale up when needed.
“AI was part of our transformation strategy,” he says.
IHG deployed IPSoft Amelia, an AI-enabled IT service desk agent that can hold intelligent conversations, answer questions, perform common support tasks and, more importantly, learn from experience.
 
 
 













 
 

The company did not lay off staff. Instead, it increased headcount from 35 to 115. However, without the platform, IHG would have had to hire an additional 120 agents to fill demand, says Whigham.

“Our metrics are much improved over what we had before we started,” he says. “And our usage of the self-help and the AI platform has increased tremendously.”
IHG’s experience provides a glimpse of AI’s future impact on IT work, one in which productivity is enhanced and new career opportunities open up, but with some caveats on the types of tasks and roles that may no longer be necessary for humans to complete in the future.
 
 
 













 
 

Training up
Unlike most chatbots, Amelia doesn’t just work from a canned list of questions and answers, he says. “I can have a conversation with her, and she understands the intent of the conversation, and also learns from that conversation,” he says. “If she can’t answer your question or resolve your request, she will transfer it to a live human agent — and stay in that conversation, observe the exchange that takes place, and learn from it.”
Amelia can follow the thread of a conversation and pick up on a question after a long gap.
“If you had a life-change event and needed to update your insurance, and you had to get off the phone to do something else, she can pick that conversation back up the next time you come back,” he says. “Even a year later.”
 
 
 













 
 

With Amelia handling this “zero tier” support, humans can focus on more difficult issues and unusual situations. Some have also begun transitioning to roles where, instead of responding to calls, they are monitoring Amelia and training her.
“We’re leveraging their expertise in the soft skills and hard skills in technical support,” says Whigham, who hasn’t seen pushback from staff concerned about training robots that will eventually take their jobs.
“They embraced it,” he says. “It became the go-to place — everyone wanted to join. My skills are going to increase; this is the direction things are going.”
 
 
 













 
 

To get the employees up to speed on the new technology, IHG sent them to training from IPSoft, as well as that provided by other vendors, including IBM.
But the company has decided against developing its own AI technology from scratch, he says.
“If you are not in the AI or cognitive industry, you shouldn’t be trying to build a cognitive strategy,” he says. “I’ve seen other organizations try to get involved with it, and they seem to be overwhelmed. You should have a business strategy that this technology is just a part of.”
 
 
 













 
 

AI-related opportunities will expand
For IT pros, AI technologies present significant opportunities. By becoming expert at deploying AI technology for maximum business value, and integrating it with other tools and services, new career paths will open up. But even at a rudimentary level, AI will free up IT pros for higher-value tasks by taking over repetitive work.

“I wouldn’t use it to automate a person’s job per se, but make something better,” says Mike Fitzmaurice, VP of workflow technology at Nintex Group.
AI is particularly good at massively repeatable tasks, he says.
 
 
 













 
 

“At huge amounts of scale, people get tired and are terrible at pattern recognition,” he says. “Any kind of repetitive task, even if it looks creative, if it’s pattern based, it could be something AI could do.”
Nintex, for example, is adding third-party AI components, such as Microsoft’s sentiment analysis service, to its workflow automation offering. This allows companies that are not necessarily expert in AI to add these capabilities to a wide variety of routine tasks.
“In earlier years it was a specialty thing that only people with a lot of knowledge and scale and resources could do,” he says. “That’s not true anymore. AI is for everybody; you just need to know where to look. I think 2018 is the year when AI becomes something we can all use if we have the foresight and motivation and vision to use it.”
 
 
 













 
 

According to Gartner, by 2019, more than 10 percent of IT hires in customer service will mostly write scripts for bot interactions, and, by 2020, 20 percent of companies will dedicate workers to monitor and guide neural networks.
Some companies will also benefit from a more in-depth use of artificial intelligence, which could require training beyond that offered by bootcamps or vendors.
PayPal, for example, uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to add efficiencies to everything from risk management to customer life cycle management, says Nolwenn Godard, PayPal’s director of pricing product.
 
 
 













 
 

But there is a lack of AI talent, compared to demand, she says.
Another challenge is diversity and cognitive bias.

“There is a lack of women representation in AI,” she says. “We need ethical controls and tools for bias mitigation within the datasets and algorithms.”
 
 
 













 
 

She expects to see exceptional growth in the use of AI in the next few decades, allowing for more natural language use, larger data sets processed in real time, and more connections between systems.
AI developers will also focus on enhancing the human experience, she says. “For example, having AI that can talk, see, respond or proactively provide recommendations, while augmenting human abilities.”
The coming AI economy
For most firms, using products from Google, Microsoft, IBM and other vendors makes more sense than, say, building their own translation engines, chatbots, or image recognition systems.
 
 
 













 
 

“But companies also need to be looking at what their unique differentiation is, and see if AI can be applied,” says Bruce Molloy, CEO of Springboard.ai. “If they have to do with, for instance, product manufacturing, there could be a lot of insights that could give these companies an advantage into creating these products.”

There are possibilities for AI-powered companies, business models, and products and services that didn’t exist before, he says.
There’s also a defensive aspect, as well, he added, since AI powerhouses like Amazon have made it clear that they’re targeting many sectors that are ripe for transformation, such as, for example, retail sales and food delivery.
“This is their strategy,” he says.
 
 
 













 
 

Google and Tesla are other examples of companies using new technologies to challenge incumbents in a wide variety of industries, says Gregg Gordon, VP of the data science program group at Kronos.
“For companies that are slow to change, they will first feel the slow drain of profitability that comes from running less efficient operations than others,” he says. “They will then continue to ignore trends but react to the financial pressure caused by those inefficiencies in the form of cost-cutting. This will only accelerate them toward their demise. These companies have confused underinvesting with operational efficiency.”
But the threat isn’t just from the brand-name AI leaders.
Gartner predicts that, by 2019, startups will overtake Amazon, Google, IBM and Microsoft in driving the AI economy with disruptive business solutions, and AI platform services will cannibalize revenues for 30 percent of market-leading companies.
For companies that take advantage of the new technologies, AI can free IT pros from routine tasks. Those people can now shift to higher-value activities, which may also require additional training.
According to the TCS report, 80 percent of executives surveyed are currently investing in AI, and almost 100 percent plan to do so by 2020.
Future-proofing your IT career for the AI era
Experts recommend that IT pros looking to future-proof their careers should broaden their skill sets to include business or communication skills, growth areas like cybersecurity, or develop deeper industry expertise.
In cybersecurity, for example, there are about two million jobs that are going to go unfilled in the next few years, says Ian Doyle, executive security advisor for the U.S. federal government at IBM.
But AI is going to be a big component of cybersecurity, since the technology can help make security professionals more effective.
IBM recently conducted a survey to find out what the federal government is thinking about AI, and about half want to be leaders, and half want to be followers — but there was almost unanimous interest in using AI for cybersecurity.
Application development is also going to remain a strong area, says Matthew Mead, CTO at Chicago-based SPR, a consulting company focused on digital transformation.
“We’re going to try to incorporate more AI in what we do, but for the typical developer, the idea that the job will be majorly changed in the near future, that is absolutely false,” he says. “I think things are actually a little bit hyped in some ways. I’m not saying that there aren’t going to be a lot of transformations, but there’s a lot of hype and embellishment in this realm.”
Maybe in 100 years, AI systems will be creating new applications from scratch and taking over all other IT functions, he says.
“I’m not saying it’s all rosy, but in the next 20 years, in terms of job declining in IT, I don’t see that,” he says.
According to McKinsey, AI could help create 20 to 50 million new jobs globally in both in-house IT workers and external or outsourced tech consulting jobs.
Cloud, automation bigger threats than AI
Some traditional IT jobs might go away, experts say, but the culprit won’t be artificial intelligence — at least, not yet.
Instead, regular old automation, outsourcing and cloud technologies will have a bigger short-term impact, says Anand Rao, partner and global AI leader at New York-based PricewaterhouseCoopers.
“A number of factors are increasing productivity,” he says.
Take for example, CRM systems. Companies used to do CRM in-house, or with on-premises software. As they switched to Salesforce, all the in-house CRM-related support and administration jobs disappeared.
Many companies are still running legacy systems, systems that still work and that the companies have invested heavily in.
“But at a certain point, it collapses under its own weight,” Rao says. “Either the business goes broke, or they decide to start over with a fresh infrastructure. And the cost of packing up and starting something brand new has been decreasing substantially. It’s just a matter of time before they’re forced to upgrade.”
Is it all just hype?
With all the news reports recent advances in speech recognition, language translation, image processing, pattern recognition, and, of course, self-driving cars, many people are predicting an AI-powered cataclysm where humans become obsolete.
“People claim the world will be transformed overnight,” says Rao. “I don’t think that’s happening. At the same time, it’s not just all made-up vapor ware and will all just die down. It’s somewhere in between.”
Manual, repetitive, and routine tasks will be automated, he says. “And when all of those things are automated, you want to be in place where you can add value.”

VADER showcases its data analytic capabilities: a map view of distribution feeder; machine learning based power flow estimating voltages; radial configuration detector identifying switch states; and electric vehicle load flexibility visualization.







Today, utilities have limited ability to see the impact of higher amounts of solar photovoltaics (PV) in a given area of the distribution system, which can be problematic for system planning and operation. New research efforts from the Energy Department’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory at Stanford University are using artificial intelligence (AI) applications to help utilities better integrate their solar resources and make more informed planning decisions for enhancing grid reliability, resiliency, and security.In September 2017, SLAC researchers announced that they won a research award from the Energy Department’s Grid Modernization Initiative to explore the creation of an autonomous grid that can absorb power fluctuations(link is external) from renewable sources and respond to major grid disruptions with solar generation. Selected as a part of the Grid Modernization Laboratory Consortium effort to enhance the resilience of distribution systems, the team aims to develop a solution that employs data analytics and AI technologies, enabling automatic identification and strengthening of weak spots on the grid and faster recovery times after grid disturbances. The resulting solution has the potential to automatically optimize solar resources on the grid, reconfiguring itself for either normal or emergency operations.This effort stems from the same team’s successful, first-of-its-kind software platform that was funded by the Solar Energy Technologies Office and was designed to address PV distribution challenges with a unified, data-driven solution. The platform uses data from PV systems and smart meters that continuously updates and accurately models the electricity load and the behavior of  distributed energy resources (DERs) like a solar system on a home or business. The VADER platform, or Visualization and Analytics of Distribution Systems with Deep Penetration of Distributed Energy Resources, integrates a myriad of data streams for real-time monitoring, analytics, and visualization and control of DERs in a consistent and user-friendly manner. Through machine learning, the VADER platform can model potential changes in connectivity and the behavior of DERs on the grid, enabling the real-time optimization and automation of distribution planning and operation decisions for utilities.  The VADER platform is scalable and open-source, meaning that users can freely access the original source code to further refine it and contribute their improvements to the platform’s code library. In March 2017, the SLAC research team held a hands-on workshop for managers and engineers from California utilities, researchers from several national labs, and representatives from the growing number of companies operating in the data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence fields. The platform already serves as the foundation for the SLAC team’s autonomous grid effort and startups are beginning to consider how they can leverage the newly available tools.Learn more about the Grid Modernization Initiative and the grid integration research from the Solar Energy Technologies Office.

Insights How AI is changing game development

By Raka Mahesa -   January 16, 2018 - 12:00 am 3179 0 










4 min readArtificial intelligence is transforming many areas, but one of the most interesting and underrated is gaming. It’s not that surprising; after all, an AI last year beat the world’s top Go player, and it’s not a giant leap to see how artificial intelligence might be used in modern video gaming. However, things aren’t straightforward. This is because applying artificial intelligence to a video game is different from artificial intelligence applied to the development process of video game. Before we talk further about this, let’s first discuss artificial intelligence by itself.
What exactly is artificial intelligence? Artificial intelligence is, to put it simply, the ability of machines to learn and apply knowledge. Learning and applying knowledge is such a broad scope though. Being able to do simple math calculations is learning and applying arithmetic knowledge, but no one would call that capability artificial intelligence.
Artificial intelligence is a shifting field
Surprisingly, there is no definite scope for the kind of knowledge that artificial intelligence must have. It’s a moving goalpost, the scope is updated whenever a new breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence has occurred. There is a saying in the artificial intelligence community that “AI is whatever hasn’t been done yet,” meaning that whenever an AI problem is solved and figured out, it no longer counts as artificial intelligence and will be branched out to its own field. This has happened to searching algorithm, path finding, optical character recognition, and so on.
 So, in short, we have a divide here. When experts are saying artificial intelligence, they usually mean the most cutting-edge part of artificial intelligence like neural networks or advanced voice recognition. Meanwhile, problems that are seen as solved, like path finding, are usually no longer being researched and not counted as artificial intelligence anymore.
And it’s also why all the advancement that has happened to artificial intelligence doesn’t really impact video games. Yes, video games have many, many applications of artificial intelligence, but most of those applications are limited to problems that have already been solved like path finding and decision making. Meanwhile, the latest artificial intelligence technique like machine learning doesn’t really have a place in video games.
Things are a bit different though for video game development. Even though video games themselves don’t use the latest and greatest artificial intelligence, their creation is still an engineering process that can be further aided with the advancement in AI. Do note that most of the artificial intelligence used for game development is still being explored and still in an experimental phase.

 There has been research done recently about using an intelligent agent to learn about level layout of a game and then using that trained agent to layout another level. Having an artificial intelligence handle the level creation aspect of a game development will definitely increase the development speed because level designers now can just tweak existing layout instead of starting from scratch.
Automation in game development
 Another aspect of video game development that already uses a lot of automation and can be aided further by artificial intelligence is quality assurance (QA). By having an artificial intelligence that can learn how to play the game will great assist developers when they need to check for bugs and other issues. But of course, artificial intelligence can only detect stuff that can be measured like bugs and crashes, and they won’t be able to see if the game is fun or not.
Using AI to improve game design
 Having an AI that can automatically play a video game isn’t only good for testing purposes, but it could also help improve game design. There was a mobile game studio that uses artificial intelligence to mimic human behavior so they can determine the difficulty of the game. By checking how the artificial intelligence performs on a certain level, designers can project how real players would perform on that level and adjust the difficulty properly.
 And that’s how AI is changing game development. Despite all the advancement, there is still plenty of work to be done for artificial intelligence to truly assist game developers in their work. That said, game development is one of those jobs that don’t need to worry about being replaced by robots, because more than anything, game development is a creative endeavor that only humans can do. Well, so far at least.

From software development to construction to logistics and finance, every company has projects that need planning, managing and monitoring. But the tools we use to do that are often complex, designed for specialists and don’t do as much as they could to warn about potential problems. Could AI-powered decision support systems and automation make more of your projects successful by reducing costs and mistakes, analyzing risks, making things more efficient or keeping things on time and on budget?
Here is an early look at how artificial intelligence, machine learning and predictive analytics could affect project outcomes in the years to come.
Thinking about risk
Managing a project well takes more than just making a great plan in advance and sticking to it. Interdependencies within your project and external changes make outcomes unpredictable. Estimates and many forecasts are at best intuition; at worst, guesses and handwaving. Modern management techniques such as agile and continuous delivery aim to reduce uncertainty by working incrementally, but that still doesn’t guarantee final delivery. Portfolio management selects a mix of projects that balance risk and reward (because it’s hard to stay competitive if you only play it safe), but that means assessing risk accurately, which is hard.

“The risk in a project is always probabilistic and the human mind is not good at doing risk-based probability management, especially when we’re combining many different probabilities,” Aptage CEO John Heintz tells CIO.com. It’s easy to confirm your own opinions; “I got the answer I expected, and I agree with myself.”

We’re also prone to what he calls “hope-based planning.”
“It’s natural: We’re to some degree all optimistic; we all see the positive path forward, the way this could work, and we don’t have evidence to prove it can’t work, so we hope it’s going to go the way we want it to,” Heintz says.











 
 
 
Aptage uses machine learning to predict the outcomes of projects using data you already have, such as the planned start and end date of various phases of the project (and, if you have them, estimates about any backlogs) to learn the completion rate of the team and predict the likelihood of delivering on time. Estimates are always uncertain, so you can put in upper and lower bounds for how long tasks will take (or the software can model it using the golden ratio). You also need to put in some information on the source of risks: “Don’t just blame the last person holding the problem; figure out what’s going wrong,” as Heintz puts it.
That’s information most teams will have, he suggests. “Teams that don’t have a tremendously rigorous process can still use our tool right away. If a team has a backlog that are seven things written on a napkin, we can still give them some help. If a team has a complete best case/worse case analysis and work breakdown structure for the whole project, we can give even more advice,” Heintz says.
Aptage uses visualisations of confidence, feasibility and whether the risk is going up or down over time to help you switch between what Heintz calls fast and slow thinking.  “We had to create these visuals because we need to connect with the fast-thinking, intuitive mind to help people see things in a way that lets them make good intuitive decisions. If the project starts getting a whole lot more red, the lizard brain should have some fear. Maybe we still decide to go forward with that project, but we’ve thought about it and we’ve been triggered to think about the right things. ‘That might hurt but we have a safety net; if we have to spend 20% more on this project, we’ll still have a good probability [of success]; let’s take the risk.’”











 
 
 
The algorithms and models Aptage uses were designed for software development but also fit construction projects. The first (rather basic) integration is with Jira and in time Heintz hopes to put the visualisations inside tools project teams use on a daily basis such as Microsoft Project, Primavera construction planning, Trello, or even feature roadmaps and KPI dashboards in Salesforce or Power BI. “If I put a task into Trello or ServiceNow, when might I expect and with what level of confidence is the estimate? Give me the 90 percent confidence date.”

Generally, the goal is to avoid getting to the end of a project and being surprised. “If you knew today that the project was at 60 percent risk of not being done and done well, what would you do differently? We point you to the source of the risk and what you might do about it.”
Aptage won’t fix problem projects but it should warn you about them, Heintz says. “It’s the ability to collaborate and talk about ‘This is a high-risk project and we’re managing it well’ versus ‘We don’t know what the risk is; we’re just going to promise it’s going to be done and at the last minute we might say no.’”











 
 
 
Resource management
Some of the AI tools businesses are already adopting, such as predictive maintenance, can help make projects more efficient and reliable, says Lance Olsen, director in Microsoft’s Cloud AI team. “One of the most common things that can throw a project out of whack in terms of its schedule and risk is unforeseen failure in systems that you’re relying on in the project.”
In general, he believes that AI will be most helpful by removing risk in projects, “whether that’s prediction for the project up front or removing risk in the execution.” That’s going to make projects more efficient: “There’s so much uncertainty and how we deal with it now is that we create giant buffers,” he says.
AI can already help track progress and performance, especially if you take a broad view of what project management is, suggests Nadya Duke Boone, director of product management for platform at New Relic, which recently added what it calls applied intelligence to its performance monitoring tools. “A lot of project management is going on where there’s nobody who officially has that title or role and there’s a new set of project management tools we don’t think of consciously that way.”











 
 
 
With incremental projects, success isn’t always determined at the end of a project; it’s more likely to be on-going KPIs around quality and reliability. “Customers asking ‘Are we on track?’ are using metrics like how many deployments can I do? How reliable are my deployments? Am I having regression errors? Is my performance where I want it to be?” Boone says. “AI could identify slowly ramping trends in that stream of data that are significant but hard to see — or easy for humans to ignore even if they see them.”
New Relic Applied Intelligence includes a tool called Radar that looks for these patterns and issues, suggests actions and learns from what users pick up on. “It’s helping us find things like a week-over-week slowdown; something trending in the wrong direction where we wouldn’t have caught it because the project is so focused on day to day,” she says.
AI, Boone suggests, could help make sure we pay attention to bad news. “I’ve known cases where metrics have shown things are trending in the wrong direction but it’s hard for people to acknowledge that.”











 
 
 
It can also help with automation, leaving project managers more time to actually manage. “A large part of AI in any industry right now is removing the work that’s tedious and letting the humans focus on the part machines don’t do well. So much work in project management is not number crunching; it’s about do we have clear goals, is everyone moving in the same direction and is their work coordinated.”
New Relic, for example, uses a chatbot to remind managers to manage capitalizable hours. Boone also speculates that natural language analysis of how people phrase status updates might help to determine how confident they are about progress.
“Reducing monotonous and time-consuming tasks that aren’t necessarily high value but show up in every project” doesn’t just free up time, Olsen points out; it also reduces errors.











 
 
 
Rick McEachern, vice president of business development at Software AG, sees robotic process automation (RPA) taking over a lot of the mundane, repetitive, high-volume tasks from project managers, like merging data from different systems to coordinate deliveries and other logistics and updating case management systems. “There’s a ton of work that could be done as far as transferring data, moving it around between different systems, handling mass emails, doing reporting and file and document processing,” McEachern says. “Robots are great at that sort of activity.”
“You could have robots looking at different updates and status reports and data and doing alerting if a file was supposed to be here on a certain date and it didn’t arrive,” McEachern suggests. “If someone hasn’t submitted their latest estimate, you might use a robot with the case management system to ping them to say, ‘It’s two days away from deadline and I’m going to send you an hourly reminder’. And when they upload the new schedule, I can invoke a robot to extract the data I care about and put it into the master project schedule.”
Predicting and experimenting
RPA could also be useful for resource optimization and scheduling, if you can define business rules or create data models that they can use to evaluate and report exceptions. That could be particularly useful for transportation and logistics, he said; “There are lots of different optimizations where you can use machine learning, like least cost routing for minimizing fuel costs or optimizing loads.”











 
 
 
“You can use forecasting as a way to fine-tune project execution and have fewer misses,” Olsen says, but if you really want to use AI to improve projects you have to look for ways to experiment and improve. “These kinds of practices are going to be what really differentiate organizations in the next five years. These are systems of intelligence and CIOs have to design these to drive the rate of experimentation.”
“Part of that loop is saying, ‘We got 75 percent accuracy last month; what about the other 25 percent? Maybe weather is a predictor for us; let’s get a weather feed and add it to the model and maybe we get to 80 percent.’ Look at your rate of experimentation and your rate of learning as a key metric for success on your projects. How are you being systematic about getting that learning and driving more experiments?” Olsen says.
It’s tempting to think that you could use machine learning to make forecasts about which projects will succeed and fail, but that could be a long way off, he warns.











 
 
 
“What we see people focusing in today is components within the project; the resources and progress against the resources, or the health or performance of resources. As that matures, a logical next step is to go up a level and what about the whole project itself — how can we make that more efficient?” That will mean gathering detailed information about a lot of projects, he warns.
“To get predictions about projects you have to be capturing data about the project itself and feeding that into a model and saying what were the anomalies or common traits in the project that made it successful?” Olsen says.
Boone also sounds a note of caution on how accurate predications can be, noting that some project tasks are easier to estimate than others because they’re more repetitious. When working as a project manager she found experienced electrical engineering estimators were very accurate, and not just because of how long the construction industry has had to build up knowledge.











 
 
 
“The difference between engineering and building software is that we don’t know the unit of work; in engineering that’s a foot of conduit or a yard of concrete but we just don’t have that in software. Laying asphalt is laying asphalt no matter where and when you’re doing it but even adding a column to a database can be very different depending on where you are in the project and who is doing it,” Boone says.
For large, complex projects with a lot of staff where the final goal is something repeatable, like setting up a new data center or moving applications to a container platform, Boone believes there could be enough data for machine learning to identify outliers, anomalies or correlations. “Here are three interesting correlations we’ve found; you might want to dig into them. That’s treating AI as a partner to the project manager and letting them apply their human-level and emotional intelligence.”
