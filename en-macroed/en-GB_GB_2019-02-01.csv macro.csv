His interests include but are not limited to whiskey, kimchi, and Catahoulas. Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  In case we haven’t been cautioned enough about the threats of emerging artificial intelligence, a panel of academics addressed the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) on Sunday with a warning that advancements in intelligent and semi-intelligent automation could lead to overwhelming unemployment across many industries.   Machines’ ability to recognize patterns is yet to match our own, but their increasing sophistication in regards to tasks like speech recognition and data analysis has seen AI applied to real world applications such as autonomous driving. In this vain Bart Selman, professor of computer science at Cornell University, said, “For the first time, we’re going to see these machines and systems as part of our everyday life.” The predicted success of self-driving cars may prove to be a blessing that greatly reduces car accidents, but – with 10% of U.S. jobs requiring some degree of vehicle operation – the technology will also undoubtedly effect the labor market. Moshe Vardi, professor of computer science and director of the Ken Kennedy Institute for Information Technology at Rice University, told AAAS, “We can expect the majority of these jobs will simply disappear.” He went on to suggest that the disconnect between the manufacturing industry and job growth is a result of automation. Though manufacturing volume is right now at its peak, U.S. manufacturing jobs are currently below the figures from the 1950s. He pointed to the 250,000 industrial robots in the U.S. and the increasing growth rate of their use. What Vardi suggests will happen is “job polarization”, a phenomenon that emerges when high-skilled jobs demand complex human intelligence and low-skilled jobs are too expensive to automate. Thus, the middle ground jobs will be the easiest to automate, leading to greater economic inequality. Vardi also noted that although this issue is widely regarded as a threat that could make a huge impact on American economic life, there is no discussion of it in politics, particularly not in the presidential election. “We need to start thinking very seriously: What will humans do when machines can do almost everything?” he said. “We have to redefine the meaning of good life without work.” Furthermore, Wendell Wallach, an ethicist at Yale University’s Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics and the Hastings Center, said  “There’s a need for concerted actions to keep technology a good servant and not let it become a dangerous matter.” He also proposed that 10% of AI research funding should be put towards studying the impact that AI machines will have on society, echoing Vardi’s concern that politics has failed to address the tremendous issue. “We need strong, meaningful human control,” he said.  More than a billion dollars was spent on AI research last year. That’s more than has been spent in the fields entire history. That may not match investment in the auto industry or other tech sectors, but it illustrates the increasing role that AI will play in our everyday life and economy.  Image credit: Joost Swarte Related Posts AI and IT Consultants: 2 Ways to Win Deals and Trust in the Coming Age of AutomationConsultants and professional services leaders face one of the hardest times in business in the… AI is Colorizing and Beautifying the WorldArtificial intelligence may be making the world smarter, safer, more functional and accessible.

 Artificial intelligence is helping physicists working on particle accelerators in many ways. AI is being used to help manage the large volume of data produced by these experiments, to find patterns in this data, and to develop new ways of analyzing it. Additionally, AI is being used to develop new computer vision algorithms that can be used to detect features in particle jets and other data sets. Experiments at the world’s largest particle accelerator, the LHC (the Large Hadron Collider), at the physics lab CERN, produces more than one million gigabytes of data every minute. Even after compressing this colossal amount of data, the data amassed in just a few hours is tantamount to an entire year’s worth of data that social networking sites like Facebook gather from users—far too much to save and study by mortals like us. This volume of data will also increase multifold in the years to come. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN (Photo Credit : apod.nasa.gov) Driven by a conscientiousness to efficiently manage these discoveries with such staggering data volumes, physicists working on particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have brought in artificial intelligence (AI) experts to tackle the LHC data deluge. For the uninitiated, artificial intelligence (AI) is a specially designed set of software that mimics the way humans learn and solve complex problems. Machines running AI programs learn activities like speech recognition, planning, problem-solving, perception, and planning by themselves and can work efficiently without getting lost in the labyrinth of data. The next generation of particle-collider experiments will engage some of the world’s most intelligent thinking machines if the links between particle physicists and AI researchers take off smoothly. Such machines could make incredible discoveries with nearly zero human input. Recommended Video for you:PlayParticle accelerators: What are they, how do they work and why are they important to us?  Role Of Artificial Intelligence (AI) In The Higgs Boson Discovery Particle physics and artificial intelligence are not strangers. The ATLAS and CMS are two of the popular LHC experiments that paved the way for the discovery of the Higgs Boson a few years back. They were able to do so thanks to machine learning technology, a form of artificial intelligence that trains algorithms to recognize patterns in data and bring out meaningful conclusions from those patterns. The AI algorithms were primed using simulations of the debris from particle collisions and learned to accurately detect the patterns educed from the decay of rare Higgs particles among thousands of other unimportant bits of data.

Deep learning uses structures that are loosely inspired by the human brain—consisting of a set of units (equivalent to neurons in our brain). Each unit combines a set of input values to generate an output value, which in turn is passed on to other neurons in the deeper layer of the network. In other words, deep learning refers to the use of neural networks—computer programs with a structure inspired by a dense network of neurons in the human brain. An illustration of deep learning.

However, advanced ‘deep learning’ algorithms, such as those used by tech giants like Google (Google Assistant) and Apple (Siri) in their voice recognition systems, typically receive no such supervision and must find their own ways to categorize the data in their respective fields. Google Assistant responding to user’s query on a Pixel phone (Photo Credit : Maurizio Pesce/Wikimedia Commons) Until recently, the success of deep learning was limited because training the AI software to supervise themselves for subsequent uses was difficult. Also, earlier, the neural networks employed for deep learning were just a couple of layers deep, but thanks to recent advances in machine learning and neural networks, it is now possible to build and train networks that are thousands of layers deep. Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), an international mega-science project, employs these sophisticated deep learning algorithms to study neutrino science and proton decay.

Many of the new tasks that AI programs use have their applications in computer vision. Computer vision deals with automatic extraction, analysis, and detection of relevant information from standalone images or a sequence of images. It’s similar to facial recognition, which most high-end camera phones come with these days, except that in particle physics, image features are much more abstract than simple facial features like your eyes, ears or nose. Some popular neutrino experiments, like Nova and Microboone, produce data that can be easily translated into actual images. Computer vision algorithms can be readily used to discern features in such scenarios. However, in particle accelerator experiments, images first need to be recreated from a heterogeneous pool of data that is generated by millions of sensor elements. Even if the data doesn’t look like images, physicists can still use computer vision programs if they process the data in the correct way, opines machine learning researcher Alexander Radovic. One area where this approach could wield great results is in the analysis of particle jets produced in large numbers during particle accelerator experiments, like those at the LHC. Particle jets are narrow suds of particles whose individual tracks are extremely difficult to detect. Computer vision algorithms could help to identify features in jets. Today, physicists are primarily employing artificial intelligence to find features in the large pool of data generated from particle acceleration experiments that can help us answer the biggest questions concerning particle physics.  Ten years from now, AI algorithms might be able to independently ask their own questions and notify researchers when they come up with groundbreaking new discoveries in physics!

AI tools are already starting to automate what used to be time-consuming manual processes — but the results may be good for artists’ creativity, rather than potential job killers.Companies that make industry-standard creative tools like Adobe and Celsys have been adding AI features to their digital art software in recent years in the hopes that it’ll speed up workflows by eliminating drudge work, and give artists more time to experiment. From machine learning tools that help find specific video frames faster, to features that color in entire works of line art with just a button, AI is being incorporated in subtle, but surprisingly impactful ways.The best AI features can assist artists and cut out repetitive tasks, says Tatiana Mejia, who manages Adobe’s AI platform, Sensei. Her assessment comes from a Pfeiffer Consulting study commissioned by Adobe, in which most creatives said they weren’t worried about being replaced by AI, and that they could see the most potential for AI and machine learning applied to tedious, uncreative tasks. That could mean a smart cropping feature that automatically recognizes the subject of a photo, or automatic image tagging to help people find stock photos faster. They’ll still require an artist’s control, too. “Creativity is profoundly human,” Mejia says. “AI cannot replace the creative spark.”Adobe makes a big splash every time it shows off concept AI tools, like content-aware fill for video, but it’s usually the more subtle AI features that actually ship.

AI tools are already starting to automate what used to be time-consuming manual processes — but the results may be good for artists’ creativity, rather than potential job killers.

Companies that make industry-standard creative tools like Adobe and Celsys have been adding AI features to their digital art software in recent years in the hopes that it’ll speed up workflows by eliminating drudge work, and give artists more time to experiment. From machine learning tools that help find specific video frames faster, to features that color in entire works of line art with just a button, AI is being incorporated in subtle, but surprisingly impactful ways.

The best AI features can assist artists and cut out repetitive tasks, says Tatiana Mejia, who manages Adobe’s AI platform, Sensei. Her assessment comes from a Pfeiffer Consulting study commissioned by Adobe, in which most creatives said they weren’t worried about being replaced by AI, and that they could see the most potential for AI and machine learning applied to tedious, uncreative tasks. That could mean a smart cropping feature that automatically recognizes the subject of a photo, or automatic image tagging to help people find stock photos faster. They’ll still require an artist’s control, too. “Creativity is profoundly human,” Mejia says. “AI cannot replace the creative spark.”

Ian Cheng, BOB, 2018, artificial lifeform. 
 








COURTESY THE ARTIST AND GLADSTONE GALLERY, NEW YORK AND BRUSSELS




Over the past few years, artist Ian Cheng has been creating what he’s called “live simulations,” or digital moving-image works that change over time and address ideas about evolution, artificial intelligence, and our fear of the unknown. In 2017, some of these works were included in a solo exhibition at MoMA PS1 in New York, where they received rave reviews. For his first show with Gladstone Gallery in New York, Cheng is showing a new work, BOB (Bag of Beliefs), an “artificial lifeform,” as the artist calls it, centered around an AI creature who’s part snake, part branching tree. Users can interact with BOB, the piece’s titular protagonist, through an iOS app called Bob Shrine, which allows users to give BOB various objects, including a shiny fruit, a rock, and a shrub. BOB will then interact with each object and learn what he wants to do with it, and in the process determine whether he trusts the person that offered it to him or not. To learn more about the work, ARTnews chatted with Cheng ahead of the show’s opening. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.
ARTnews: This piece premiered at the Serpentine Galleries in London in March of last year. Since then, you’ve completely redone the work’s AI, right? 
Ian Cheng: Yeah, that’s right. I pretty much restructured the architecture of its mind, which was a significant undertaking. So that’s probably the main difference between the Gladstone version and the Serpentine one, but it’s resulted in a lot of other implications, because the heart of the project is BOB’s AI. I realized that I needed to give BOB the other half of its brain, which I call the “Congress of Demons.” Primarily, it gives BOB motivations. [Humans] don’t just recognize an apple, we’re motivated to recognize that apple and do something with it because we’re hungry. We’re constantly motivated by something—we’re never just in a neutral observational state. Even when we’re neutrally observing, we’re hungry, maybe for information, or we’re staving off boredom. 

I’m really curious about the language you’ve used to describe BOB. What is demonic about the demons? 
There’s psychological literature about how several different sub-personalities compose a person. We built the work around the idea [of demons] because it motivated me and everyone that I work with to understand that level of sub-personalities. They’re impulsive and possessive, like demons possessing you. Your whole body is forced toward that one goal. I chose the metaphor of a “congress,” meaning that the demons meet every few seconds in BOB’s mind to decide who gets to be in charge, and they’re all competing.
Aside from the programming of BOB, the aesthetic of the project is really interesting to me, too. What went into how BOB’s look? 
I was sitting in my studio thinking about what BOB looks like, and the natural combination manifested almost like a daydream. It was a snake that, as it grew and learned, fractalized like the branches of a tree. I don’t know why I chose that. Personally, I have a deep fear of snakes because as a kid, I went to the pet store and a baby snake latched on to my finger, and they had to pry it off, but they couldn’t kill it because it was merchandise. [Laughs.] Snakes also recur in imagery across cultures, and I think that’s because there’s an inherent neurobiological instinct to be alert to snakes. So snakes somehow became synonymous to alertness or awareness. A snake is not a purely evil being, but it’s a being that makes a human more aware.
You’ve continually returned to working with AI. What interests you about it?
I think it goes back to my own interest in cognitive science as an undergrad. I’ve just been very interested in behavior and how people learn. Specifically, I’m obsessed with this idea of how a person deals with change. And I’m obsessed with this duality, this relationship between known and unknown and between order and chaos. It’s manifested in the world, and it’s manifested in our own neurobiology. I think it’s so crazy that the two hemispheres dividing the brain are literally a mirror dividing the world into known and unknown. I think that’s so beautiful and under-appreciated.
People are generally scared of AI. Everyone’s so paranoid about its potential, it seems. Do you think that’s warranted? 
It’s an interesting question, and I’m of two minds about it. On the one hand, the general fear of AI is coming from an insecure place. If human beings believe that the most threatening thing is oppressive power, then AI seems like a threat because it’s unknown—our projection is that its first move would be to use its power against us. However, that’s not entirely true, because in making BOB and working with AI, there’s a huge possibility of AI being an extension of a human being, integrated into human culture. I think there’s great opportunity to see it as an augmentation rather than a separate entity that’s potentially threatening. 
However, in making BOB, the other side of me realized where a threat might lie. People are interested in AI that feels sentient and lifelike, whether at the level of a pet or a digital human companion. . . . In making BOB, I had to start from the most basic, animalistic, limbic core of the brain—the most basic drives and desires like threat, fight/flight, territory, status. There’s an instinctual layer [to sentient beings], which I would say is that demonic layer. There’s something maniacal about basic desires. Then there’s the [more] social layer where you learn to cooperate with other people, but you also learn to cooperate with your future self. To get BOB to the social level, I had to first program a foundational motivational structure for this brutal chimpanzee level. My fear about AI and making this is that whoever does this at an industrial scale, if they want life-like AI, they have to go through this chimpanzee level. But chimpanzees can rip each other apart over a banana. I recognize that that evolutionary stage is necessary to get anything remotely resembling the complexity and intelligence of our own culture and human behavior. But they better get through it fast.

Millions of gig economy workers around the world now earn a living on so-called crowd worker websites — work that falls under the umbrella of crowdsourcing, or dividing up tasks into minuscule portions to spread over a large number of people. The sites pay as little as $1 an hour for individuals to perform short, repetitive tasks, such as identifying images seen in pictures and churning out product reviews.
Some of these crowd workers were unknowingly helping to build out the Pentagon’s battlefield drone capability.
The work was done as part of a Defense Department initiative called Project Maven. Last year, The Intercept reported that the Pentagon had quietly tapped Google as part of the project to develop an artificial intelligence program to help Air Force analysts swiftly sort the thousands of hours of drone video and choose targets on the battlefield.
Outsourced crowd workers were tasked with providing the initial image data labeling — correctly identifying parts of an image — that allowed Google’s artificial intelligence program to tell buildings, images, trees, and other objects apart.
The artificial intelligence program, however, must learn to be able to distinguish between objects on the videos — and in order for the program to learn, someone must teach it. Enter the outsourced crowd workers, who were tasked with providing the initial image data labeling — correctly identifying parts of an image — that allowed Google’s artificial intelligence program to tell buildings, images, trees, and other objects apart. The role of the crowd workers has garnered little attention.
Emails obtained by The Intercept show that shortly after Google inked the deal with the military, the tech giant began working to label a set of satellite images captured by a technology known as wide-area motion imagery. In October 2017, Google sent a company called CrowdFlower — which subsequently changed its name to Figure Eight — the raw images with instructions on data labeling. The data labeling project started showing results quickly over the following month, as engineers developed better guidelines for the crowd workers to teach the artificial intelligence to identify the objects.

Project Maven, with the help of the crowd workers, was designed to allow Pentagon officials to engage in “near-real time analysis” and to “click on a building and see everything associated with it,” including people and vehicles, according to leaked documents obtained by The Intercept.
Asked if crowd workers have continued to contribute to Project Maven, a spokesperson for Google referred our questions to Figure Eight, which did not respond to The Intercept’s inquiry.

Since 2007, Figure Eight has hosted one of the largest digital platforms that allows individuals to sign up to perform micro-tasks, such as data annotation. The “human-in-the-loop” service is marketed as a cost-effective way for companies to fine-tune large data sets to make algorithms more accurate. Other firms in the industry include Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, Upwork, and Clickworker.
Will Pleskow, an account executive at Figure Eight, confirmed his company’s role on the Project Maven initiative during a September 2018 interview with The Intercept at the AI Summit, a trade show for machine-learning companies. Pleskow said the workers performing the data labeling, known as “contributors,” did not know that they were working for Google or for the military, which is not an unusual arrangement.
“Our customers have the option of showing who they are. Most of the time, it’s kept anonymous,” said Pleskow. He added that his firm provides similar image labeling tasks to improve the quality of technology for autonomous vehicles, such as driverless cars.
Several Figure Eight workers told The Intercept that it is not out of the ordinary for workers to be left in the dark about how their assembly-line style of data entry is used.
“Contributors to the Figure Eight platform are not given who the data will benefit,” said one former crowd worker, who used an online username when The Intercept reached out over social media. “Usually, they are given a reason for why they are doing a task, like, ‘Draw boxes around a certain product to help machines recognize it,’ but they are not given the company that receives the data.”
Another former crowd worker said that Figure Eight only provided the identity of the end-user client in a handful of scenarios, typically when the platform was used to conduct academic studies.
“Workers absolutely should have the right to know what they are working on, and especially when moral or politically controversial activities are involved.”
The rise of the gig economy has presented a myriad of challenges for organized labor. Most gig economy firms, including virtually all crowd-worker platforms, classify their workers as contractors, which means that they do not qualify for benefits, minimum wage, or overtime.
The distributed network allows for a global workforce. Figure Eight has a large user base in countries such as Venezuela, Indonesia, and Russia, as well as the United States. The far-flung employee base and individualized tasks on an opaque platform provide few opportunities for questioning corporate decisions.
Pleskow said in the September 2018 interview that he was unaware of any discontent or ethical concerns from Figure Eight workers after the revelation of the Project Maven initiative last year.



At Google, however, an open rebellion broke out over the project. Several employees quit Google in protest, while others openly challenged the Silicon Valley giant’s leadership, claiming that the company had abandoned its “Don’t Be Evil” ethos. Employees demanded that the company swear off future “warfare technology” projects. Executives were later caught misleading workers, erroneously stating that the contract was merely worth $9 million, while internal documents revealed that Google expected Project Maven to ramp up to a $250 million contract.
Following the protest, Google executives announced that they would not renew work on Project Maven after the initial phase of the contract ran its course — though they did not promise to eschew military work in the future.
Other tech giants are reportedly interested in engaging the military as it continues to deploy artificial intelligence technology. Much larger machine-learning projects may require vastly new engagement from gig economy workers, who may unknowingly engage in the work.
“Workers absolutely should have the right to know what they are working on, and especially when moral or politically controversial activities are involved,” said Juliet Schor, a sociology professor at Boston College, in an email to The Intercept. “It’s a basic dimension of democracy, which should not stop at either the factory or the platform ‘door.’ For too long, the country has tolerated erosion of basic civil rights in the workplace, as corporations assume ever-more control over their workforces. It’s time to win them back.”

BOT or NOT? This special series explores the evolving relationship between humans and machines, examining the ways that robots, artificial intelligence and automation are impacting our work and lives.






The artificial intelligence agent behind the Iconary picture puzzle game, known as AllenAI, has been given a decidedly un-Terminator-like persona. (AI2 Graphic)
For decades, the games that put artificial intelligence to the test have been played human vs. machine – whether it’s checkers, chess, Go, poker, StarCraft or “Jeopardy.” Why isn’t there a game where the AI and the human are on the same side?
Now there is, and you can play, too.
Researchers at Seattle’s Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence are taking the wraps off Iconary, a Pictionary-type puzzle game in which an AI and human players take turns putting together pictures and guessing what phrases the pictures signify. Anyone can play the game with the AI agent, nicknamed AllenAI, by going to Iconary.AllenAI.org.
But it’s not just a game.
Iconary is also a platform designed to see how far the institute, known as AI2, can go in its quest to perfect what the game’s inventors call “common-sense AI” — that is, the ability to understand everyday concepts and make abstractions to deal with new situations.
“We wanted to study the kinds of games that teach us more about the underlying assumptions and knowledge about how the world works,” said Ali Farhadi, a University of Washington computer scientist who heads up AI2’s Perceptual Reasoning and Interaction Research team, or PRIOR.

Farhadi said the structure of the game meshes with how he and his colleagues believe AI will actually be used in the real world, in contrast to the Terminator-tinged dystopia that comes up so often in the debate over the future of AI.
“Thinking about this space, and also all the noise that’s out there saying that AI’s going to wake up tomorrow and rule the world, and we’re all going to be slaves to the AI and it’s going to kill everybody … we don’t believe that,” he said. “The future that we believe in is an AI who can help human beings, and actually collaborate with human beings in achieving a goal.”
Testing for theory of mind
A key concept for understanding collaboration, and human-style intelligence in general, is a little something called “theory of mind” — basically, our ability to put ourselves in someone else’s shoes and see reality through their eyes.
Theory of mind is what’s thought to distinguish human cognition from animal cognition, although some scientists say they see signs of the trait in chimpanzees, birds and other creatures. It’s what makes it possible to imagine alternate scenarios and formulate strategies for those scenarios, even if they’ve never been encountered before.
Farhadi said the theory-of-mind approach is different from the typical machine-learning approach to AI, which involves training the software on myriad real-world examples that have been encountered before. Iconary could provide a way to get at the distinction.
Iconary grew out of the PRIOR team’s search for alternatives to the adversarial games so often used for AI research.
“We stumbled upon Pictionary as a perfect testbed for us,” Farhadi said. “If you are playing a Pictionary game successfully, you are collaborating with your teammate. You are connecting to your teammate at a deep level and getting into his or her thought. You need to understand his or her way of thinking about the problem … and you need the predict the future behavior of your teammate, based on the kind of feedback you provide.”
Pictionary checked all the boxes that Farhadi and his fellow researchers wanted to fill, but they had to change the game to have it work on a computer.
The PRIOR team created a vocabulary of 1,200 icons, ranging from stick figures and arrows to pictures of fruit and buildings. When AllenAI is doing the drawing, it will formulate a phrase – for example, “drinking fruit punch” – and then select the icons for a mouth, a glass and an orange to represent the phrase.

If you’re not able to guess the correct phrase, AllenAI will try again, focusing on the incorrectly guessed words. For example, if you guess “drinking orange juice,” AllenAI will fill the screen with fruit icons to steer you in the right direction.
“Growing up, I played a lot of Pictionary … I think AllenAI is a better drawer than my family,” AI2 principal software engineer Sam Skjonsberg joked.
When it’s your turn, you can draw rough sketches of your clues and pick out the icons that come closest to your clues from a menu. Then AllenAI will try guessing the phrase. If it can’t figure out the puzzle, it’ll ask for more clues.
For the researchers, the most interesting part has to do with how AllenAI puts together the clues and figures them out.
“AllenAI has never before encountered the unique phrases in Iconary, yet our preliminary games have show that our AI system is able to both successfully depict and understand phrases with a human partner, with an often surprising deftness and nuance,” AI2 CEO Oren Etzioni, Ani Kembhavi and Carissa Schoenick say in a Medium blog post.
Kembhavi, a research scientist at AI2, said AllenAI is catching on to our human ways.
“It has started understanding the meanings of and the usages of abstraction,” he said. “For example, it will put an arrow when it wants to show, let’s say, a state change. If the phrase is ‘ice melting,’ it will show ice with an arrow and water — which is a state change.”
Unleashing AllenAI
Now it’s time to send AllenAI out of the lab and into the wider world. “We need large-scale feedback from human players about the game to tell us what’s working and what’s not working, so we can actually devise the next steps,” Farhadi said.
Iconary might be tweaked to provide AllenAI with icons for even more abstract concepts such as “roommate” or “governor.” And because Iconary is open-source, like all the data generated by the late billionaire philanthropist Paul Allen’s scientific ventures, other AI researchers can tweak it for non-commercial purposes. (For what it’s worth, the makers of Pictionary haven’t raised legal objections to Iconary.)

Eventually, AI2’s team might mix things up so that you’re playing with AllenAI only part of the time, and with human players the rest of the time.
“At the end I’m going to ask you if you could distinguish the fact that you played a human or you played a machine,” Farhadi said. “We’re going to basically see how much data we can get out of this as a first step, and that will give us a benchmark to evaluate how far we are from a Turing-qualified intelligent machine.”
Farhadi suspects that Iconary will have even more staying power than chess, Go or StarCraft as a tool for exploring the frontiers of artificial intelligence.
“This is a whole different way of thinking about AI and games, and what you can actually learn from playing a game other than just being the best at playing that game,” he said. “Because of that, I believe we are going to spend a fair amount of time on this. I certainly hope that looking back at this in five years, this will really be … an icon in that space.”

He weighs a little over 100 pounds, has auburn dyed hair, and wears a hoodie emblazoned with the words “Dope Shit.” But in China’s rise to superpower status, the 20-year-old student is a foot soldier playing a vital role.Yin works at Bainiaohe Digital Town, a tech hub set deep in the tree-covered hills of China’s southwestern province of Guizhou. The region is traditionally known for growing tea and producing fiery Moutai liquor, but today it’s luring Yin, and hundreds of young Chinese like him, to work in the booming sector of Artificial Intelligence or AI.For eight hours each day, they sit at computer terminals on brightly colored swivel chairs and help refine the reliability of facial and voice recognition software, driverless car programs, and even mobile apps that are used to identify plants and insects.“I used to think of AI as what’s in American sci-fi movies—many robots and Star Wars,” says Yin. “AI right now is nowhere near that level. It needs to learn. My job here is to teach it.”He does that by highlighting objects in images on his computer monitor. To help a self-driving car algorithm learn to identify common features of a city street, for example, Yin clicks on endless images of buses, sidewalks, or pedestrians. To assist voice recognition software, he’ll listen to garbled human pronunciations and input the correct meaning. It’s a thankless, repetitive job.“AI is only as intelligent as the labor you put in,” says Hu Dingxiang, project manager for Mengdong Technology Ltd., the Beijing-founded firm where Yin works.As China’s economy slows and rising wages make manufacturing less competitive, the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is turning to technology to arrest the slide. Strategic technologies such as AI are a key focus. President Xi Jinping’s Made in China 2025 plan aims to ensure that China dominates AI as well as other high-tech industries, such as aeronautics and microchips.Last year, China’s State Council issued the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan to establish China as the “premier global AI innovation center” by 2030, when it predicts that China’s core AI industry will be worth $148 billion, with AI-related fields ten times that.With Beijing and Washington sparring over cybersecurity, trade and myriad other issues, this has huge strategic implications. In 2017, Russian President Vladimir Putin said whoever leads in AI “will become ruler of the world.”According to Adam Segal, director of the Digital and Cyberspace Policy Program at the Council on Foreign Relations, the “significant economic and national security implications … are why Beijing is so driven to be a major player in AI.”It’s a mission that has seeped down through Chinese society. China’s first dedicated AI school opened in September. An AI textbook series designed for primary and secondary students is expected to hit classrooms this year. In the future, the hope is that gleaming “AI Farms” like Mengdong’s will replace the nation’s polluting factories.“Just like the Middle East has lots of oil, China can be the world’s center for AI data,” says Sheng Hua, CEO of Mengdong, whose clients include Chinese tech titans Baidu, JD.com and Alibaba.AI farms are well suited to impoverished regions like Guizhou, where land and labor are cheap and the climate temperate enough to enable the running of large machines without expensive cooling systems. It takes only two days to train workers like Yin in basic AI tagging, or a week for the more complicated task of labeling 3D pictures.“Thanks to cheap labor, which only costs a tenth of what our overseas competitors must pay, we have a big advantage,” says Hu. “The U.S. cannot compete with China when it comes to cheap labor.”Some experts believe China overestimates the importance of data volume and point out that Silicon Valley firms still reign supreme when it comes to top quality algorithms—the building blocks of AI. But that may change as the Chinese government supports AI with plenty of hard cash.The country’s AI sector took nearly 50% of funding going to AI startups globally in 2017, according to CB Insights, surpassing the U.S. for the first time. AI-related patent applications in China are also surging ahead of those filed at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.‘We are like farmers in technology’Bainiaohe Digital Town is attached to the campus of Guizhou Forerunner College, a government-subsidized school providing “non-profit education for rural needy students,” according to giant red billboards posted around its lush grounds.Founded in 2012, the school boasts an AI-focused curriculum. Taiwanese tech giant HTC is a cornerstone investor. The 4,000-odd students pay only $1,500 for their three-year degree, thanks to state scholarships. In addition, from their sophomore year they can offset school fees by working at Mengdong or one of the other tech firms at Bainiaohe—an incongruous faux Alpine village of European-style buildings overlooked by a neoclassical clock tower.For Yin and his colleagues, work as an AI tagger is steady and safe when compared with toiling on a dusty construction site, or in a noisy factory making cheap goods for export. The office is clean and comfortable and they can take regular breaks. On average, Yin labels around 300 pictures each day, and has a personal record of tagging 14,000 cars in a single shift. The sedentary lifestyle does take its toll, however.“Since taking this job I’ve become so tired of look at computer screens that I’ve stopped playing video games,” he says. “Instead, I try to look at something far away to make my eyes feel more comfortable.”Yin You (C), 20, a tagger at an AI farm, has dinner with colleagues in the company dorm at Bainiaohe Digital Town in Guizhou, China, on Dec. 4, 2018Zhang ChiYin earns on average about $450 per month, which is significantly more than a typically assembly line worker. He shares a room at a spanking new boarding house with eight colleagues. They live and cook together, and treat TIME to Guizhou’s famous pig fat hotpot.The recipe was passed to Yin by his parents, who both work as migrant laborers, jumping from farm to construction site to factory depending on season and demand. Were it not for AI, Yin would likely follow their path. “Today, I’m a migrant worker in AI,” he jokes. “But it’s not as tiring as carrying bricks at a construction site.”His employer does more than just develop software. TIME speaks to one worker at Mengdong who says she’s “helping to shape public opinion” by monitoring social media for negative comments about clients. When criticism arises, she and other paid cheerleaders blanket the topic with positive remarks to drown it out.Of course, fake Amazon or Yelp reviews are common in the West. But here, there is nothing surreptitious about it. “When there is negative coverage, we help clients to handle the crisis,” shrugs Sheng, the CEO.It’s a tactic that has long been employed by the CCP. A 2016 study by Harvard, Stanford and UC San Diego academics estimates that Beijing is behind the posting of 448 million social media comments annually. The potential for AI to take on this propaganda role is huge. “AI is part of the CCP’s strategy to maintain control and guide public opinion,” says Segal.Mengdong also creates “Party-building” propaganda using virtual reality, which is then disseminated to CCP organizations across China. “I handle this project personally,” says Sheng proudly. “Virtual reality is perfect technology to show and recreate major events from the past.”But right now the focus is mostly on the future—for both young people like Yin and for all of China. “If a country wants to be stronger, it needs farmers to grow food,” says Yin. “We are like farmers in technology. Without us, China cannot grow strong in AI.”—With video by Zhang Chi",https://schema.org,VideoObject,,,,,,,,,,,'AI Farms' Are at the Forefront of China's Global Ambitions,,"{'@type': 'SeekToAction', 'target': 'https://time.com/5518339/china-ai-farm-artificial-intelligence-cybersecurity/?jw_start={seek_to_second_number}', 'startOffset-input': 'required name=seek_to_second_number'}",https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/1g6umlPd/poster.jpg?width=720,,,,,,,,2019-02-01T08:58:54.000Z,https://cdn.jwplayer.com/manifests/1g6umlPd.m3u8,https://time.com/5518339/china-ai-farm-artificial-intelligence-cybersecurity/,PT2M38S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ethical AI
Artificial intelligence (AI) can enable prediction and problem-solving approaches that save the lives of seriously ill hospital patients. Yet AI can also be used in ways that threaten human rights.
For example, we have seen allegations of AI entrenching bias and discrimination in the United States criminal justice system, as well as in policing in Australia.
Scandals and controversy connected to new technologies have increased public concern regarding decision-making that uses AI, data privacy, cyber security, political influence and labour market shifts.
Technology and human rights 
Our challenge as a nation is to ensure these technologies deliver what Australians need and want, rather than what they fear. There is added urgency because other countries are investing heavily in these areas.
Globally, we are witnessing a fundamental shift. Leaders in the technology industry are increasingly abandoning a long-standing hostility to government intervention. Many are starting to call for new forms of governance and regulation.
Whitepaper
Protecting Australians while powering our future economy requires innovation that reinforces Australia’s liberal democratic values, especially human rights, fairness and inclusion.
Making this vision real is a complex task. It will involve carefully crafted laws supported by an effective regulatory framework, strong incentives that apply to the public and private sectors, and policies that enable Australians to navigate an emerging AI-powered world.

He has reported on politics and policy issues for news organizations including National Memo, Massroots, NBC, and is a published science fiction author. Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  Both artificial intelligence and robotics have been improving over the past few years. Large companies are betting billions that in the near future we will have cars that can drive themselves, drones that can fly themselves to deliver packages, automatic fast food chefs, AI personal assistants, manufacturing robots that can train themselves and other robots, etc.  This has raised some big questions, including: What happens if a new technology causes millions to lose their jobs in a short period of time, or what if most companies simply no longer need many human workers? In the United States our current society is built on the premise that companies and government need human workers to function, and most able bodied adults can perform tasks companies would pay for. Everything from the way we design our transit systems to allow for daily commutes to work, to how we structure health insurance and how set monetary policy is based on this premise. The Federal Reserve’s core function is its dual mandate: to maximize employment and keep prices stable. One of the most important policy decisions based around this concept of mass employment is how the government is funded. Roughly 80 percent of all federal tax revenue comes from income or payroll taxes. If even a modest segment of workers are displaced, the impact on government budgets could be substantial. To deal with this possible problem the world’s richest man, Bill Gates, has floated the idea of a robot tax. Gates has suggested we tax robots at a rate similar to what we would’ve taxed the workers so tax revenue could pay for more employment in education and elder care. The idea is also to slow down the speed of the technology’s adoption, to give society more time to adjust. This article is going to give an overview of where a robot tax stands as a policy from multiple angles: Whether a robot tax might even be needed. I.e. how quickly are robots going to replace workers How such a robot tax might work. What are the arguments for or against it. The first big policy question about the robot tax is if it would even be needed in the next few decades.  Background Insight: Robotic Automation and the Job Market Gates obviously thinks broad job replacement will happen relatively soon. He told Quartz that, “warehouse work, driving, room cleanup, there’s quite a few things that are meaningful job categories that [will be replaced by machines], certainly in the next 20 years.” However, estimates about the rate and speed of automation in the next several years vary greatly.  Gates is not alone in his fears. A 2013 analysis by Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael A. Osborne concluded about 47 percent of total US employment is in jobs that are at high risk of computerization, possibly over the next decade or two. As Carl Benedikt Frey explains in the video below, he believe automation not trade will be the main driver in changes in employment:  Similarly a 2017 analysis from PwC found 38 percent of jobs in the United States “could potentially be at high risk of automation by the early 2030s.” They found transportation, manufacturing, wholesale and retail to be at the greatest risk.  On the other hand Melanie Arntz, Terry Gregory, and Ulrich Zierahn published a paper in 2016 which concluded that just 9 percent of jobs in the United States are at risk of automation. The following graphic shows how PwC charted compares these three analyses: Expert perspectives vary on just how much of the US / UK job market is at “high risk” for automation. (Include this graph or just a graph based on this data from page 3 of the united states https://www.pwc.co.uk/economic-services/ukeo/pwcukeo-section-4-automation-march-2017-v2.pdf) The economist Dean Baker has been skeptical that there is good evidence automation will soon lead to mass unemployment. He points to data on productivity, which in theory should be going up if we are currently seeing big advancements in automation spread throughout the whole economy. “It’s averaged just 1.2 percent annually in the last 10 years and 0.6 percent in the last five years. By comparison, productivity growth averaged 3 percent in both the decade from 1995 to 2005 and the long Golden Age from 1947 to 1973.”  Chart from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (source) Dean doesn’t dispute the idea we could theoretically reach a tipping point in AI where technology could lead to mass job displacement at some point in the future, but he thinks the current focus on robots taking people’s jobs is misdirected at this time. Looking at current productivity numbers, a tax that disincentive investments in productivity would seem misguided right now. There is broad agreement at least some jobs will be eliminated by technology, but the United States has been able adjust to technology eliminating some jobs over the past several decades. There are less travel agents now compared to 30 years ago but more yoga instructors.  That is why the rate at which it will happen is so important. Will it happen at a rate our current system can already manage, or at some point in the near future will it turn into a torrent of change requiring new government policy solutions?  Could a Robot Tax Work? The first step is policy makers need to be convinced that automation will lead to mass unemployment is a serious and potential problem. It is only once policy makers think there is a problem does talking about the design possible solutions become relevant. At this point the idea of what a “robot tax” would be or how it would actually work in practice is very nebulous. There are a few ideas which have been called a “robot tax,” but they very significantly in design and scale. For example South Korea relatively modest move to reduce the tax incentives for investment in automation a being called a “robot tax,” but that is nowhere near the scale what Gates is envision for his “robot tax.” The Telegraph (article linked above) jestingly points out that machines and humans share some important limitations – namely – the inability to build IKEA furniture Gates simply suggested that “some of it could come on the profits that are generated by the labor-saving efficiency there. Some of it could come directly from some type of robot tax.” A segment of a proposed motion in the EU parliament which was rejected simply called for looking at, “levying tax on the work performed by a robot or a fee for using and maintaining a robot should be examined in the context of funding the support and retraining of unemployed workers whose jobs have been reduced or eliminated.” Levying a fee on each robot sounds much easier in theory than it practice. How would we define “robots” for these tax purposes? What separates a tool from a robot or a complex computer program from AI? For example, a backhoe replaces human ditch diggers, but few people consider that a “robot.” Is a vending machine a human-replacing robot? What about a vending machine that can automatically alert its owner when it is out of a product? What about a vending machine the size of a small store that can automatically stock itself and answer complex questions from customers? If a country did try to place a fee on actual robots, it is likely it would be difficult for some companies to avoid the tax. Manufacturing robots, self-driving cars, delivery drones, and anything that looks like a classic “robot” or clearly replaces a specific category of job would likely be hit.  But there are a lot of marginally robot-like tools that manufacturers would aggressive lobby policy makers to exclude from the tax. Alternatively, manufacturers could modify the tools just enough to exploit some loophole in the definition of a robot.  To get a sense of just how complex and protracted a legal question “what is a robot” could turn into, one needs only look at the legal fight (and huge tax repercussions) over whether Marvel’s mutants are “humans”.  For years, the United States has taxed the importation of “dolls,” which are representations of humans, at roughly twice the rate it taxes the import of “toys.” So Marvel entered into a decade-long legal fight to prove its characters like Wolverine and Spiderman weren’t technically “humans” and so their action figures would be taxed at the toy rate. One big impact of an attempt to tax specific robots might not be slowing innovation but redirecting it towards almost-robots. Right now many companies are hyping how much they are using AI and machine learning to investors, but in a country with a robot tax you could easily see the opposite: companies using very AI-like programs they refuse to admit are true AI. The difficulty of defining “what is a robot” might putting a tax on every robot a logistical and legal nightmare. As a result any “robot tax” concept might take on the form of something less direct. For example South Korea reducing the tax incentives for investing in automation is called a robot tax. It is possible to imagine the “robot tax” taking the form of higher taxes certain types of productively enhancing developments and/or the form of big tax breaks for companies that keep the size of their workforce stable each year.  A “robot tax” could also maybe take the form of a tax that target companies with high profits/revenue but small workforces. Something like a worker to profit ratio could serve as a proxy for deciding what company are making use of a lot of automation.  All of these less direct “robot tax” ideas get around the question of defining what is a robot but they all have their own implementation challenges and possible drawbacks.  Arguments “For” and “Against” For The argument for some variety of a ‘robot tax’ is based in the belief that automation will cause mass employment displacement in the near future (or at least massive economic inequality). Computer development hasn’t been linear; it has been exponential. We could reach a tipping point where machines suddenly become better than people at a whole range of tasks. The last major employment displacement, the industrial revolution, caused decades of falling wages and significant social unrest. A robot tax would accomplish two goals.  First, it would slow down the deployment of automation to give society more time to adjust to the possible employment displacement.  Second, it would raise money needed to keep government programs going and to pay for programs to deal with this displacement, such as increasing the number of teaching jobs. Against The arguments against a “robot tax” are numerous, and many have been touched on in other parts of this article. Mostly they come down to questions of is it needed, can it even be implemented, would it cause more problems than it tries to solve, and is there a better way. Is it needed? – Some analysts don’t believe automation will have as big an impact on employment in the near future. With the current weak productivity numbers, talking about policies that would disincentivize productivity gains seems like a bad idea. Meanwhile, automation does eliminate some jobs but also creates new ones; it is possible the rate of change will be manageable.  Could it be implemented? – Trying to define what is or is not a “robot” for the purposes of taxation would be an extremely difficult task and would turn regulations over the issue into a never-ending legal battle. The different states and levels of the United States government can’t even agree on what legally constitutes a sandwich, a question that requires far less technical expertise than defining what is an AI or robot. Could it backfire? – Andrus Ansip, the European Commissioner in charge of the bloc’s push for a Digital Single Market, argued aggressively against the robot tax, saying if the EU adopted a robot tax, “somebody else would take this leading position.”  Unless all countries on Earth adopted a robot tax, you run the risk of robotics companies moving their operations from countries with a robot tax to nearby ones without. Instead of getting money from robots and slowing their deployment, the country with a robot tax could lose out on the cash and cause the development to occur elsewhere.  Is there a better way? – If mass automation does cause dramatic job displacement, the money that was previously spent on wages for these jobs doesn’t just go away. It should result in high corporate profits and capital gains. Instead of trying to figure out how to tax specific robots, countries could just try other ways to increase revenue from corporations.  This could be accomplished via high corporate taxes and capital gains taxes. Noah Smith suggested an alternative to the robot tax could be developing a sovereign wealth fund. The government could buy up shares in companies, or it could replace the entire corporate tax structure with the requirement that all companies give the government a set percentage of shares.  Concluding Thoughts For businesses, the idea of a robot tax is new and mostly unformed, so there is little threat of it happening in the next few months or even years. But it is starting to gain the attention of policy makers in Europe and the United States.  Earlier this year Benoît Hamon, the Socialist candidate for president in France, campaigned on the idea. San Francisco Supervisor Jane Kim, launched the Jobs of the Future Fund to advocate in California the idea “if an employer replaces a human worker with a robot or algorithm, he or she would pay a tax.” And recently UK Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn called automation an urgent challenge that must be managed – see the video below from 49:36 to 51:55:  The regulatory and legal nightmare that would likely result from any effort to define what is a robot, and trying to place a specific fee on every type of robot, makes a broad-based, true robot tax seem very unlikely. When it comes to broad-based policy, it is likely the idea of a robot tax will end up being used as a way to simply refer to the general idea that automation could cause mass employment displacement.  Any big policy change that would result from that opinion is in practice more likely to take the form of restructuring how much a government taxes payrolls versus corporations and capital gains. That doesn’t mean we won’t see some targeted robot taxes. While a fee on every possible type of robots would be a massive legal challenge, it would be fairly simple to tax a few very specific types of robots.  I think the most likely short term concern for companies about discussions around a robot tax is that a few high-profile industries could be hit with a tax at a national or local level. For example, self-driving taxis, self-driving trucks, and delivery drones are all very easily seen as job-taking “robots” by the public. Local legislatures could target these robots with a special fee to fund retraining of drivers or to make up lost revenue. These taxes would be easy to understand and give legislatures the chance to say they are doing something. For the AI and robotics industries overall, the idea of a robot tax creates an interesting collective action problem. On an individual level, any one company benefits from playing up the labor-saving benefits of their technology and making very optimistic claims about how quickly it will be adopted.

FrayMeta’s A.I. ScrapingAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSupported bySKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe Rise of the Robot ReporterShare full articleRead in appCredit...Cam CottrillBy Jaclyn PeiserFeb. 5, 2019As reporters and editors find themselves the victims of layoffs at digital publishers and traditional newspaper chains alike, journalism generated by machine is on the rise.Roughly a third of the content published by Bloomberg News uses some form of automated technology. The system used by the company, Cyborg, is able to assist reporters in churning out thousands of articles on company earnings reports each quarter.The program can dissect a financial report the moment it appears and spit out an immediate news story that includes the most pertinent facts and figures. And unlike business reporters, who find working on that kind of thing a snooze, it does so without complaint.Untiring and accurate, Cyborg helps Bloomberg in its race against Reuters, its main rival in the field of quick-twitch business financial journalism, as well as giving it a fighting chance against a more recent player in the information race, hedge funds, which use artificial intelligence to serve their clients fresh facts.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“The financial markets are ahead of others in this,” said John Micklethwait, the editor in chief of Bloomberg.In addition to covering company earnings for Bloomberg, robot reporters have been prolific producers of articles on minor league baseball for The Associated Press, high school football for The Washington Post and earthquakes for The Los Angeles Times.Examples of machine-generated articles from The Associated Press: TYSONS CORNER, Va. (AP) — MicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR) on Tuesday reported fourth-quarter net income of $3.3 million, after reporting a loss in the same period a year earlier.MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) — Jonathan Davis hit for the cycle, as the New Hampshire Fisher Cats topped the Portland Sea Dogs 10-3 on Tuesday.Last week, The Guardian’s Australia edition published its first machine-assisted article, an account of annual political donations to the country’s political parties. And Forbes recently announced that it was testing a tool called Bertie to provide reporters with rough drafts and story templates.As the use of artificial intelligence has become a part of the industry’s toolbox, journalism executives say it is not a threat to human employees. Rather, the idea is to allow journalists to spend more time on substantive work.“The work of journalism is creative, it’s about curiosity, it’s about storytelling, it’s about digging and holding governments accountable, it’s critical thinking, it’s judgment — and that is where we want our journalists spending their energy,” said Lisa Gibbs, the director of news partnerships for The A.P.The A.P. was an early adopter when it struck a deal in 2014 with Automated Insights, a technology company specializing in language generation software that produces billions of machine-generated stories a year.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIn addition to leaning on the software to generate minor league and college game stories, The A.P., like Bloomberg, has used it to beef up its coverage of company earnings reports. Since joining forces with Automated Insights, The A.P. has gone from producing 300 articles on earnings reports per quarter to 3,700.The Post has an in-house robot reporter called Heliograf, which demonstrated its usefulness with its coverage of the 2016 Summer Olympic Games and the 2016 elections. Last year, thanks to Heliograf, The Post won in the category of Excellence in Use of Bots at the annual Global Biggies Awards, which recognize accomplishments in the use of big data and artificial intelligence. (As if to make journalists jittery, the Biggies ceremony took place at Columbia University’s Pulitzer Hall.)Jeremy Gilbert, the director of strategic initiatives at The Post, said the company also used A.I. to promote articles with a local orientation in topics like political races to readers in specific regions — a practice known as geo-targeting.“When you start to talk about mass media, with national or international reach, you run the risk of losing the interest of readers who are interested in stories on their smaller communities,” Mr. Gilbert said. “So we asked, ‘How can we scale our expertise?’”The A.P., The Post and Bloomberg have also set up internal alerts to signal anomalous bits of data. Reporters who see the alert can then determine if there is a bigger story to be written by a human being. During the Olympics, for instance, The Post set up alerts on Slack, the workplace messaging system, to inform editors if a result was 10 percent above or below an Olympic world record.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTA.I. journalism is not as simple as a shiny robot banging out copy. A lot of work goes into the front end, with editors and writers meticulously crafting several versions of a story, complete with text for different outcomes. Once the data is in — for a weather event, a baseball game or an earnings report — the system can create an article.But machine-generated stories are not infallible. For an earnings report article, for instance, software systems may meet their match in companies that cleverly choose figures in an effort to garner a more favorable portrayal than the numbers warrant. At Bloomberg, reporters and editors try to prepare Cyborg so that it will not be spun by such tactics.A.I. in newsrooms may also go beyond the production of rote articles.“I hope we’ll see A.I. tools become a productivity tool in the practice of reporting and finding clues,” said Hilary Mason, the general manager for machine learning at Cloudera, a data management software company. “When you do data analysis, you can see anomalies and patterns using A.I. And a human journalist is the right person to understand and figure out.”The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones are experimenting with the technology to help with various tasks, including the transcription of interviews or helping journalists identify “deep fakes,” the convincingly fabricated images generated through A.I.“Maybe a few years ago A.I. was this new shiny technology used by high tech companies, but now it’s actually becoming a necessity,” said Francesco Marconi, the head of research and development at The Journal. “I think a lot of the tools in journalism will soon by powered by artificial intelligence.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe New York Times said it had no plans for machine-generated news articles, but the company has experimented with using A.I. to personalize newsletters, help with comment moderation and identify images as it digitizes its archive.Previous technological advances have rendered moot a number of jobs that were once essential to the journalism industry, such as Linotype operator. But reporters and editors have not yet been tempted to smash the programs now taking care of some of the busy work that once fell to them.“When you look at the ways things are laid out and printed and produced and distributed, a lot of those functions have been replaced with technology,” said Nastaran Mohit, the organizing director for the News Guild of New York. She added that she did not consider A.I. a threat to newsroom workers, while also noting that the guild monitors emerging technologies to make sure that hypothesis holds true.Mr. Marconi of The Journal agreed, likening the addition of A.I. in newsrooms to the introduction of the telephone. “It gives you more access, and you get more information quicker,” he said. “It’s a new field, but technology changes. Today it’s A.I., tomorrow it’s blockchain, and in 10 years it will be something else. What does not change is the journalistic standard.”Marc Zionts, the chief executive of Automated Insights, said that machines were a long way from being able to replace flesh-and-blood reporters and editors. He added that his daughter was a journalist in South Dakota — and although he had not advised her to leave her job, he had told her to get acquainted with the latest technology.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“If you are a non-learning, non-adaptive person — I don’t care what business you’re in — you will have a challenging career,” Mr. Zionts said.For Patch, a nationwide news organization devoted to local news, A.I. provides an assist to its 110 staff reporters and numerous freelancers who cover about 800 communities, especially in their coverage of the weather. In a given week, more than 3,000 posts on Patch — 5 to 10 percent of its output — are machine-generated, said the company’s chief executive, Warren St. John.In addition to giving reporters more time to pursue their interests, machine journalism comes with an added benefit for editors.“One thing I’ve noticed,” Mr. St. John said, “is that our A.I.-written articles have zero typos.”A correction was made on Feb. 5, 2019: An earlier version of this article misstated the name of a tool that Forbes is testing for reporters.
