Is artificial intelligence ready to move out of the labs and proofs of concept and into the mainstreams of enterprises? Leading industry observers say yes, it’s ready — but organizations may still need some preparation. “We’ve moved beyond the phase of ‘Is AI a shiny object?’ toward broader mainstream adoption and actual value creation,” says Bryce Hall, associate partner with McKinsey, noting that data from a survey of 2,300 executives shows a nearly 25% year-over-year increase in the use of AI in standard business processes.


Hall joined McKinsey colleague Michael Chui in a recent podcast Q&A, in which they note that while AI is being widely adopted, much of the work is confined to specific narrow use cases, versus more strategic enterprise-centric adoption. “We’re very early in this trend,” says Chui. “As much as we’re seeing this growth in adoption, less than a third of the companies that we surveyed have deployed AI in multiple businesses or functions.” Popular use cases in these initial stages of AI include improving logistics functions, reducing inventory, increasing inventory turns, and increasing overall equipment effectiveness, he adds.

These individual use cases are delivering positive results, Chui adds, estimating improvements — either for the top line or bottom line — of at least one percent to 10%.

At the same time, moving AI out of narrow use cases into wider deployments is “hard work,” Chui says, “not only because the technology problems are hard but also because the change management is really hard. There’s a reason why this doesn’t happen faster.”

PROMOTED
Part of the challenge is finding business requirements that can be satisfied through the use of AI — bringing to mind the old adage of a solution in search of a problem. Many of the emerging technologies around AI are fascinating, but it’s still unclear how businesses can capitalizing on these technologies. “For example, reinforcement learning is terrifically good at being able to train machines to play all kinds of games better, but not as obvious is how much value that can create in the world,” says Chui.
Another major industry survey concurs that AI is still in exploratory stages. Just five percent of 2,200 executives surveyed by MIT Sloan Management Review and underwritten by SAS are implementing AI widely across the organization, while 18% have implemented it in a few processes, and 19% are running pilot projects.

The MIT Sloan survey authors also outlined the work ahead to move AI deeper into the enterprise. CIOs and CTOs, for example, “will need to prioritize developing foundational technology capabilities, from infrastructure and cybersecurity to data management and development processes — areas in which those with more advanced AI implementations are already taking the lead.” AI also requires “significant changes to software development and deployment processes,” along with formal data governance efforts.

In addition, the MIT Sloan report points out, AI will require an increased focus on risk management and ethics. The survey “shows a broad awareness of the risks inherent in using AI, but few practitioners have taken action to create policies and processes to manage risks, including ethical, legal, reputational, and financial risks.”
Having the right combination of skills and competency is also essential. “It’s never just a technology challenge,” says McKinsey’s Hall. When looking at successful enterprise AI implementations, they are always aligned to business goals, and these enterprises are “doubling down on investing in current employees and upskilling and training them by creating analytics and AI academies.” Another common element is “internal collaboration and having processes in place to bring business leaders, technologists, and data scientists together to identify where there are collaboration opportunities, making it far more likely that the AI technologies actually generate business value.”

Content production helps connect brands with customers, governments with citizens and organizations with their supporters. But, while important, content production can also be a labor- and time-intensive task.







Producing articles, infographics, videos and a variety of other content requires a significant amount of work from writers and editors. With organizations producing and managing content daily, many have begun to turn to various technologies to help.
One of the more capable of these technologies is AI. The use of artificial intelligence content writing systems can help create, manage and analyze content across the production lifecycle and ease the burden that organizations feel.

Natural language and content production
One of the strengths of modern AI technology is its ability to understand, process and even generate human-readable content. One aspect of natural language processing is natural language generation (NLG), which uses machine learning to enable computers to transform structured data into natural language.
These systems take data from a variety of sources, including databases and quantitative sources, and turn it into narrative text. NLG-powered content generation systems are used to produce items such as reports, social media text, chatbot conversations, and custom content for web or mobile applications.
Advanced NLG systems can then take the text that has been generated and process it through content design systems that can give a human-like personality to the content.


Use cases and voice content creation
With NLG systems, large quantities of content can be generated in a short amount of time, thus helping an organization to save time while still reaching its content goals. Artificial intelligence content writing also enables brands to keep a consistent message and tone even if different departments produce content.
Content production outlets such as the Associated Press use AI to generate thousands of quarterly earnings reports and sports articles. Yahoo! Sports uses AI to produce weekly fantasy football reports, while the Orlando Magic basketball team uses AI to personalize in-app and email messaging to its fans.
Organizations are also turning to voice-based applications to reach their audience. The major voice assistant companies, including Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft, are introducing NLG-powered offerings that enable companies to deliver original content to users without having to spend time crafting those messages.
Through the power of AI-enabled content production, organizations can integrate voice assistants with their back-end NLG platform to provide the voice assistant with subject matter expertise and industry-specific knowledge.
The traditional writing process takes time and needs to be edited and refined before being published. Because computers can work far faster than their human counterparts, artificial intelligence content writing systems can create thousands of pieces in a relatively short amount of time.
But humans aren't fully removed from this process. Rather than publishing the AI-generated pieces directly to the audience, they are instead sent to human editors for moderation, filtering and further editing.


Intelligent monitoring tools
Creating content is just one part of the content production process. Monitoring and measuring the content and how readers engage with it is equally important. Intelligent monitoring tools help companies track a variety of different metrics to make sure content companies produce effective and attractive content.
Social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest want to keep users on their site. To do this, they must provide content to keep them engaged.
To assist with this, these companies are increasingly employing AI systems to show relevant and personalized content to each user. By continuously monitoring users, these platforms can improve their machine learning models, provide real-time feedback to advertisers and tweak their messaging for improved performance.
Additionally, AI is getting better at translating content into different languages. This is particularly important for multinational companies who want to reuse content but don't have writers that are fluent in multiple languages.
AI can accurately translate content, thus saving time, resources and money. Humans may still be the original content creator, but the AI-enabled system can take that work and replicate it across multiple languages and with culturally relevant content. This enables content developers to increase their reach.
Organizations are looking for ways to gain a competitive advantage over their competition while also delivering meaningful content and value to customers. Over the last few years, great strides have been made in using computers for content production and we see this trend continuing for years to come.

This article is part of our reviews of AI research papers, a series of posts that explore the latest findings in artificial intelligence.
Should you feel bad about pulling the plug on a robot or switch off an artificial intelligence algorithm? Not for the moment. But how about when our computers become as smart—or smarter—than us?
Debates about the consequences of artificial general intelligence (AGI) are almost as old as the history of AI itself. Most discussions depict the future of artificial intelligence as either Terminator-like apocalypse or Wall-E-like utopia. But what’s less discussed is how we will perceive, interact with, and accept artificial intelligence agents when they develop traits of life, intelligence, and consciousness.
Guide to Deep Learning Basics – by Springer
In a recently published essay, Borna Jalsenjak, scientist at Zagreb School of Economics and Management, discusses super-intelligent AI and analogies between biological and artificial life. Titled “The Artificial Intelligence Singularity: What It Is and What It Is Not,” his work appears in Guide to Deep Learning Basics, a collection of papers and treatises that explore various historic, scientific, and philosophical aspects of artificial intelligence.
Jalsenjak takes us through the philosophical anthropological view of life and how it applies to AI systems that can evolve through their own manipulations. He argues that “thinking machines” will emerge when AI develops its own version of “life,” and leaves us with some food for thought about the more obscure and vague aspects of the future of artificial intelligence.
AI singularity
Singularity is a term that comes up often in discussions about general AI. And as is wont with everything that has to do with AGI, there’s a lot of confusion and disagreement on what the singularity is. But a key thing that most scientists and philosophers agree that it is a turning point where our AI systems become smarter than ourselves. Another important aspect of the singularity is time and speed: AI systems will reach a point where they can self-improve in a recurring and accelerating fashion.
“Said in a more succinct way, once there is an AI which is at the level of human beings and that AI can create a slightly more intelligent AI, and then that one can create an even more intelligent AI, and then the next one creates even more intelligent one and it continues like that until there is an AI which is remarkably more advanced than what humans can achieve,” Jalsenjak writes.
To be clear, the artificial intelligence technology we have today, known as narrow AI, is nowhere near achieving such feat. Jalšenjak describes current AI systems as “domain-specific” such as “AI which is great at making hamburgers but is not good at anything else.” On the other hand, the kind of algorithms that is the discussion of AI singularity is “AI that is not subject-specific, or for the lack of a better word, it is domainless and as such it is capable of acting in any domain,” Jalsenjak writes.
This is not a discussion about how and when we’ll reach AGI. That’s a different topic, and also a focus of much debate, with most scientists in the belief that human-level artificial intelligence is at least decades away. Jalsenjack rather speculates of how the identity of AI (and humans) will be defined when we actually get there, whether it be tomorrow or in a century.
Is artificial intelligence alive?

There’s great tendency in the AI community to view machines as humans, especially as they develop capabilities that show signs of intelligence. While that is clearly an overestimation of today’s technology, Jasenjak also reminds us that artificial general intelligence does not necessarily have to be a replication of the human mind.
“That there is no reason to think that advanced AI will have the same structure as human intelligence if it even ever happens, but since it is in human nature to present states of the world in a way that is closest to us, a certain degree of anthropomorphizing is hard to avoid,” he writes in his essay’s footnote.
One of the greatest differences between humans and current artificial intelligence technology is that while humans are “alive” (and we’ll get to what that means in a moment), AI algorithms are not.
“The state of technology today leaves no doubt that technology is not alive,” Jalsenjak writes, to which he adds, “What we can be curious about is if there ever appears a superintelligence such like it is being predicted in discussions on singularity it might be worthwhile to try and see if we can also consider it to be alive.”
Albeit not organic, such artificial life would have tremendous repercussions on how we perceive AI and act toward it.
What would it take for AI to come alive?
Drawing from concepts of philosophical anthropology, Jalsenjak notes that living beings can act autonomously and take care of themselves and their species, what is known as “immanent activity.”
“Now at least, no matter how advanced machines are, they in that regard always serve in their purpose only as extensions of humans,” Jalsenjak observes.
There are different levels to life, and as the trend shows, AI is slowly making its way toward becoming alive. According to philosophical anthropology, the first signs of life take shape when organisms develop toward a purpose, which is present in today’s goal-oriented AI. The fact that the AI is not “aware” of its goal and mindlessly crunches numbers toward reaching it seems to be irrelevant, Jalsenjak says, because we consider plants and trees as being alive even though they too do not have that sense of awareness.
Another key factor for being considered alive is a being’s ability to repair and improve itself, to the degree that its organism allows. It should also produce and take care of its offspring. This is something we see in trees, insects, birds, mammals, fish, and practically anything we consider alive. The laws of natural selection and evolution have forced every organism to develop mechanisms that allow it to learn and develop skills to adapt to its environment, survive, and ensure the survival of its species.
On child-rearing, Jalsenjak posits that AI reproduction does not necessarily run in parallel to that of other living beings. “Machines do not need offspring to ensure the survival of the species. AI could solve material deterioration problems with merely having enough replacement parts on hand to swap the malfunctioned (dead) parts with the new ones,” he writes. “Live beings reproduce in many ways, so the actual method is not essential.”
When it comes to self-improvement, things get a bit more subtle. Jalsenjak points out that there is already software that is capable of self-modification, even though the degree of self-modification varies between different software.

Today’s machine learning algorithms are, to a degree, capable of adapting their behavior to their environment. They tune their many parameters to the data collected from the real-world, and as the world changes, they can be retrained on new information. For instance, the coronavirus pandemic disrupted may AI systems that had been trained on our normal behavior. Among them are facial recognition algorithms that can no longer detect faces because people are wearing masks. These algorithms can now retune their parameters by training on images of mask-wearing faces. Clearly, this level of adaptation is very small when compared to the broad capabilities of humans and higher-level animals, but it would be comparable to, say, trees that adapt by growing deeper roots when they can’t find water at the surface of the ground.
An ideal self-improving AI, however, would be one that could create totally new algorithms that would bring fundamental improvements. This is called “recursive self-improvement” and would lead to an endless and accelerating cycle of ever-smarter AI. It could be the digital equivalent of the genetic mutations organisms go through over the span of many many generations, though the AI would be able to perform it at a much faster pace.
Today, we have some mechanisms such as genetic algorithms and grid-search that can improve the non-trainable components of machine learning algorithms (also known as hyperparameters). But the scope of change they can bring is very limited and still requires a degree of manual work from a human developer. For instance, you can’t expect a recursive neural network to turn into a Transformer through many mutations.
Recursive self-improvement, however, will give AI the “possibility to replace the algorithm that is being used altogether,” Jalsenjak notes. “This last point is what is needed for the singularity to occur.”
By analogy, looking at determined characteristics, superintelligent AIs can be considered alive, Jalsenjak concludes, invalidating the claim that AI is an extension of human beings. “They will have their own goals, and probably their rights as well,” he says, “Humans will, for the first time, share Earth with an entity which is at least as smart as they are and probably a lot smarter.”
Would you still be able to unplug the robot without feeling guilt?
Being alive is not enough
At the end of his essay, Jalsenjak acknowledges that the reflection on artificial life leaves many more questions. “Are characteristics described here regarding live beings enough for something to be considered alive or are they just necessary but not sufficient?” He asks.
Having just read I Am a Strange Loop by philosopher and scientist Douglas Hofstadter, I can definitely say no. Identity, self-awareness, and consciousness are other concepts that discriminate living beings from one another. For instance, is a mindless paperclip-builder robot that is constantly improving its algorithms to turn the entire universe into paperclips alive and deserving of its own rights?
Free will is also an open question. “Humans are co-creators of themselves in a sense that they do not entirely give themselves existence but do make their existence purposeful and do fulfill that purpose,” Jalsenjak writes. “It is not clear will future AIs have the possibility of a free will.”
And finally, there is the problem of the ethics of superintelligent AI. This is a broad topic that includes the kinds of moral principles AI should have, the moral principles humans should have toward AI, and how AIs should view their relations with humans.
The AI community often dismisses such topics, pointing out to the clear limits of current deep learning systems and the far-fetched notion of achieving general AI.

But like many other scientists, Jalsenjak reminds us that the time to discuss these topics is today, not when it’s too late. “These topics cannot be ignored because all that we know at the moment about the future seems to point out that human society faces unprecedented change,” he writes.
In the full essay, available at Springer, Jalsenjak provides in-depth details of artificial intelligence singularity and the laws of life. The complete book, Guide to Deep Learning Basics, provides more in-depth material about the philosophy of artificial intelligence.

On 25 June this year, a first virtual mission was organised in Paris between Nadine Girault, Minister for International Relations and the Francophonie and Minister for Immigration, Francization and Integration, and Cédric O, Secretary of State to the Minister for the Economy and Finance and the Minister for Action and Public Accounts, in charge of the Digital Agenda. They took this opportunity to take stock of the work undertaken by Quebec and France in the digital field and more specifically in artificial intelligence.

The Minister and the Secretary of State welcomed the establishment of the Montreal International Centre of Expertise in Artificial Intelligence (MICIA), one of the two centres of expertise, along with the one in Paris, of the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPIA), whose secretariat is provided by the OECD.
They also wished to reiterate their willingness to contribute, together with the founding partners of the PMIA, to the responsible development and human-centred use of artificial intelligence, while respecting human rights, fundamental freedoms and their common democratic values. They welcomed the organization, by CIEIMIC, of the first international meeting of the PMIA multi-stakeholder expert group in Montreal in December 2020. Québec will participate actively in this new international partnership through a Canada-Québec Memorandum of Understanding, modelled on the UNESCO agreement.
At the end of the meeting, the ministers highlighted the three-year agreement between Université Laval (more specifically the Observatoire sur les impacts sociétaux de l’intelligence artificielle-OBVIA), the ENS and the Abeona Foundation, which allows for the invitation of a professor from OBVIA to lead the Abeona-ENS-OBVIA Visiting Research Chair in Artificial Intelligence and Social Justice, more specifically through the prism of equity, diversity and inclusion.
For one year, he will be able to develop work on artificial intelligence and social justice and interact with researchers from the Paris and Quebec ecosystems in the fields of artificial intelligence, human and social sciences and health.
Quebec-France cooperation


During their meeting, Mr. O. and Ms. Girault discussed possibilities for cooperation between the Paris and Montreal centres of expertise of the PMIA.
OBVIA and the ENS offer a research ecosystem bringing together a vast network of teaching and research institutions, various non-governmental organizations, businesses, government players and various groups from Quebec, Canada, France and internationally.
The guest chair will allow the selected professor to participate in various seminars and symposiums, both in France and in Quebec, including the Semaine numériQC.
Digital technology is at the heart of several Franco-Quebec initiatives in various fields, such as :

France-Quebec digital pathway for incubators and accelerators for startups;
Seminars on pedagogical innovation in education ;
Work on the online discoverability of French-language cultural content under the responsibility of the Ministries of Culture in France and Quebec;
Exchanges on government digital transition, telework and
digital literacy in the public service.


Québec and its metropolis, recognized as a world innovation pole, now has an ecosystem of more than 300 researchers and doctoral students, 15,000 experts and more than 11,000 students in fields related to artificial intelligence. This constitutes one of the world’s largest concentrations of researchers in deep learning.
More broadly, Quebec has a pool of 91,000 information and communications technology specialists working in nearly 5,000 organizations.
The next alternating First Ministers’ Meeting (FMM) is scheduled to take place in Quebec City in 2021.

Using artificial intelligence to craft clean air campaigns

The country-wide lockdown to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic in India resulted in an unprecedented drop in air pollution levels across cities. As people practise social distancing and marvel at the positive impact of the lack of human mobility on the environment, this is an opportune time to curate and run an effective air pollution campaign so that the new normal might be brighter.
Air pollution causes nearly two million deaths in India every year. As many as 21 out of the 30 most polluted cities in the world are in India. Yet, public outrage and civic action towards air pollution are sporadic and scattered, peaking during Diwali but remaining low-key for the rest of the year.
In light of this trend, Clean Air Fund and Quilt.AI studied the history and impact of 30 major environmental and public health campaigns in India since 2015. We sought to answer some key questions: What makes a campaign effective? What are the communication cues adopted by them? What is the role of timing and semiotics?
We analysed 21 million data points on online search behaviour for air pollution, more than 7,000 tweets, over 5,000 images and 63 Facebook pages using Quilt’s Culture A.I. tools, including emotion and linguistic analysis. We found that the nature of the air pollution campaigns in India range from the raw to the curated.
While the former represents an unvarnished truth via unfiltered images and dense rhetoric, the latter uses animated or highly edited images and sophisticated media strategies to tie local truths to global discourse.
Campaigns also differ based on the types of information they share. While some of them target informed citizens by highlighting facts and accurate information, others target passionate advocates with poignant images and moving tales to inspire individuals to act together.
Based on this understanding, we observed five broad profiles of air pollution campaigners. They are candid scientists, bridge builders, local crusaders, global activists and fearmongers.

Candid scientists
These are typically research-based organisations consisting of scientists and knowledge seekers. Their campaign strategy is to raise accurate awareness about the issue and work with various stakeholders and politicians to change policies.
They seek to convince their target audience using statistics and academic or technical jargon to precisely frame the issue and provide a glimpse into formal knowledge-sharing events. The most common phrases identified by our artificial intelligence (A.I.) include capacity building, adverse health effects and sustainable development.
This section believes that the challenges of air pollution can be solved by establishing collective mechanisms informed by fact. These campaigns use unpolished images, showing researchers and knowledge seekers hard at work during workshops and symposiums on their social media channels. The top A.I.-detected emotion from their posts is collective bonding.
Bridge builders
Bridge builders range from corporations to grassroots organisations. They are flexible communicators seeking to raise awareness on climate change. Using a spectrum of messaging, they aim to have a message that can appeal to a broad range of stakeholders.
They highlight connections between their main issue and popular issues with wide appeal. Bridge builder campaigns typically use mainstream phrases like world, climate change, mental health, and clean energy.
To them, air pollution can be solved by having a more informed society that has a strong sense of community. Almost 10% of their tweets contained the word we, while the top A.I.-detected emotion is collective bonding at 50%.
From plenary sessions and infographics to protest marches, these movements find campaign processes, messages and actions that appeal to multiple sectors and audiences.
Local crusaders
Local crusaders are grassroots organisations and local advocacy initiatives that seek to inspire the everyday citizen to act. They use simple but emotive messages in native languages. Images uploaded on social media are unfiltered, symbolic pictures of fierce demonstrations and successful community projects, invoking feelings of success and community, whilst collectively fighting the good fight.
These initiatives are highly localised, often in rural settings, in order to spur communities to join the movement. The top detected emotion is collective bonding. Local crusader campaigns differentiate themselves with the second top AI-detected emotion, which is emotional. Terms like rich soil, abundant water, lungs, beating heart and dream dominate the list of commonly used phrases.
Global activists
Global activists are the organisations inhabiting the archetype of activist-driven NGOs aiming for collective action. They reference global movements, politicised issues, startling facts, and create eye-catching infographics to inspire individual change and community action.
The top AI-detected emotions in this case are collective bonding (55%) and emotional (26%). This cluster also has the highest percentage of detected detached reality (4.3% higher than average) and the campaigns have a polarising effect due to the use of politicised perspectives.
While this creates a strong sense of community and results in greater reach, they also inadvertently cause an ‘us versus them’ sentiment, hindering the effectiveness of cross-sector partnerships.
Fearmonger
The fearmonger is not explicitly found in climate campaigns but could be an effective strategy to bring stronger attention to air pollution. Major political parties use this style of campaigning and tend to have strong, nationalistic undertones.

Multimedia uploads are a mixture of highly curated and highly raw, emphasizing the message of diversity and inclusion. The majority of messages are about specific issues that should be changed. However, for every 4-5 progressive messages, there is one repeat message about nationalism and ‘the enemy’ who we must fight against. This strategy could be effective for air pollution campaigns, especially if it is framed as a war that needs to be fought.
Each profile of campaigners has their own unique strengths; collaboration and strategic partnerships are likely to make air pollution campaigns more effective.
What makes a campaign effective?
After understanding existing and past digital air pollution campaigns in India and the counter-narratives they are faced with, we developed an online effectiveness framework that gave us insight into which campaigns have the greatest online reach and effectiveness. However, this is not a reflection of their overall impact, as offline interventions and impact are not taken into consideration.
Timing and usage of certain words are important elements of any effective campaign. We found that both the search volume and rate of change for the following air pollution-related words rise significantly between the months of October and January each year and can be used more: air pollution, causes of air pollution, air purifier, effects of pollution, PM 2.5, Diwali pollution, and anti-pollution mask.
The majority of campaigns we analysed launch in May. However, based on search behaviour, it is more strategic to launch in October and finish by February of the following year.

But as Black Lives Matter protests spread and corporations faced pressure to address systemic racism, Francis has seen his workload explode this month, from offering emotional support to the group’s 450 members to meeting with top executives to ensure the company responds in a meaningful way.Subscribe for unlimited access to The PostYou can cancel anytime.SubscribeFrancis says he’s grateful to have the ear of the chief executive officer Hans Vestberg, who has been open to the group’s request for Juneteenth and Election Day to be paid holidays and for additional transparency on workforce demographics. But pushing for black representation in the midst of police violence and protests has turned what he said was once a “fun second job” into a heavy obligation that competes with the demands of his real work, without additional time or pay“You’re called to do this work in one sense,” Francis said, “but it’s almost like if you don’t, your voice won’t be heard.”Black tech founders say venture capital needs to move past ‘diversity theater’Black employee groups are facing such tensions as corporate America grapples with concerns about racism. In the tech industry, which is still largely white, Asian, and male, the tensions have been particularly pronounced in recent weeks as companies have leaned heavily on these groups to host panels on race, vet company statements, allocate donations to racial justice nonprofits, and shepherd new diversity initiatives.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementSeventeen current and former leaders of “employee resource groups” (ERGs) — for black, Latino, LGBTQ and women workers — said in interviews they welcome the visibility and access to upper management. But they worry these programs can give business leaders a pass on diversity by allowing them to demonstrate support for minority groups without diversifying the people in charge. And some say pushing for change can hurt their careers.💻Follow TechnologyFollow“The dependence on ERGs has stifled the industry because it gives a false sense of progress,” by saddling volunteers with a small budget and disproportionate responsibilities, said Dominique Hollins, a veteran of Google and eBay who helped launch an annual summit of black and Latino groups in the Bay Area.GET CAUGHT UPStories to keep you informedPreviousNextThe Republicans are here.

Some are starting to acknowledge the burden it puts on employees.In the past year, Twitter has incorporated group leadership into performance reviews, which is tied to compensation.Francesca Fontenot, Twitter’s head of global business resource groups, said in a statement that Twitter’s employee groups “are blazing a trail on our journey to becoming the world’s most inclusive and diverse tech company. They play a central role in promoting a culture where everyone can bring their full authentic selves to work and belong.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementVerizon declined to comment for this story but pointed to a June 1 statement by Vestberg that the company donated $10 million to social justice groups and that diversity “makes us and the world better.”Tech companies also note that these employee-run groups are one facet of a larger strategy to diversify their ranks. Firms have also opted to hire executives whose sole focus is on equity and inclusion, train employees about unconscious racial bias, and increase the pipeline of talent by partnering with schools and donating to skill-training programs.Google chief executive Sundar Pichai, after meeting with Google’s black employee resource group, this month committed to a 30 percent improvement on the number of executives from underrepresented groups at Google’s senior level by 2025.Story continues below advertisementDespite these efforts, most tech companies have not significantly increased the percent of black and Latino employees in the past six years, according to public diversity reports.AdvertisementThe idea of workplace affinity groups entered corporate America more than 50 years ago with Xerox, as a response to anti-black prejudice following the 1964 riots in Rochester, N.Y., where Xerox was founded.Today, group leaders said their duties stretched beyond offering members a sense of belonging. They were frequently asked to serve as brand ambassadors, diversity strategists, recruiters, event planners and focus groups for policies and features affecting users from their community. The annual budgets for these services ranged from $1,000 to $20,000 a year. Members are sent to conferences such as AfroTech and Grace Hopper to help recruit.Story continues below advertisementGroup leaders said the impact this work had on their careers depended on their manager’s view of diversity. Many said their managers saw time spent leading employee groups as a distraction, even when it did not impact job performance. Others said they were advised to stop participating. Some felt it was the reason they were held back from expected raises and promotions.Advertisement“It may appear to the outside as though the black ERGs are listened to the most, but it is often when leadership is looking to leverage them,” said a former leader of a black employee group at a social networking company.At Microsoft, chief diversity officer Lindsay-Rae McIntyre says input from employee groups brings “tremendous impact and influence to the work we do as a company in many areas.” For instance, groups helped shape how Microsoft approached Juneteenth, offering paid time off while being careful not to frame it as a holiday “but instead to ask all employees, including those who are not members of the Black and African American community, to dedicate time and space to accelerate individual learning and engagement on the issues.” Groups also helped Microsoft curate a list of related books, podcasts and films.As big corporations say ‘black lives matter,’ their track records raise skepticismOutside of the biggest tech companies, most tech firms don’t have an executive focused on diversity and inclusion. And leaders of employee-run groups say there is high turnover for that role, which often reports to human resources rather than the CEO. This leaves driven but untrained employees to pick up the slack, which has been the case as companies try to find the right way to respond to demands for racial justice.With protests, silence is ‘not an option’ for Corporate AmericaAt Foursquare, which does not have a designated role responsible for diversity and inclusion, two black employees who are members of Fourmation, a multicultural employee resource group, volunteered to participate in a panel on race with two speakers who have publicly shown strong support for the Black Lives Matter movement, including co-founder Dennis Crowley, said director of communications Jennifer Yu, one of Fourmation’s leaders.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIn an all-hands meeting at SoFi, CEO Anthony Noto told everyone to listen to a recording of a meeting held for members of black employee group SoulFi on coping with trauma, according to two employees.

She declined to name the company.Sanchez said tech companies could do much more to fix underlying disparities in their organizations if they approached diversity like any other business initiative.“They can send a freaking rocket out to space but can’t figure out how to how to project manage [diversity, equity and inclusion],” Sanchez said. “Just do it the same way. Put smart people who are experts on it, put the resources behind, give it goals, give it room to breathe, give it room to innovate, and rewarded it accordingly.”'Make the hire.

If employers are depending on the group to implement their diversity strategy, “then people need to be released from their 9-to-5 jobs to do it,” she said. “And if you’ve got people being released from their 9-to-5 jobs, you clearly have a job function for which you need to hire.”Silicon Valley’s two-tiered system for white-collar workers is under pressure as coronavirus spreadsScrutiny of how the tech industry uses employee resource groups intensified this month after black tech workers who previously led employee groups at Twitter and Slack questioned tech leaders’ claims to support the black community.Raki Wane, who previously led Twitter’s employee resource group, Blackbirds, and now works in policy communications at Instagram, urged companies to rethink the way they use black employees to defend their reputation.“If you, an employer have deferred the work of supporting the black community to the black employees without recognizing them beyond empty platitudes, or pointed to your black employees to absolve yourselves, maybe reassess that?” Wane wrote on Twitter.Engineer Duretti Hirpa, who helped start and run Earth Tones, Slack’s employee group for people of color, tweeted, “Running an ERG hurt my career but it helped my soul.”After her manager told her the effort she invested in the group was “extracurricular,” Hirpa stepped down from the role. In retrospect, she wonders if the additional labor mainly served to bolster Slack’s reputation. (Slack declined to comment.)“The best thing I did there was making a whole group of people feel important and that somebody cared what happened to them,” she said, but, “I don’t think I would organize one again myself. It’s a little too much of my heart.""Correction: An earlier version of this story suggested the name of Slack’s employee resource group for black employees is “Earth Tones.” The name of the black employee group is “Mahogany,” while “Earth Tones” is the employee group for people of color more broadly.

Web scraping has been around almost as long as there has been a web to scrape. The technology forms the cornerstone of search services like Google and Bing and can extract large amounts of data.







Data collection on the web tends to be at the mercy of how it is presented, and many sites actively discourage web scraping. However, developers can create web scraping applications in languages such as Python or Java to help bring data into a variety of AI applications. It is crucial for developers to carefully think about pipelines they use for acquiring their data. Each step of this process -- getting the right data, cleaning it and then organizing it into the appropriate format for their needs -- must be reviewed.
These pipelines are a continual work in progress. The perfect web scraping pipeline for today may have to be completely revamped for tomorrow. Knowing this, there are a variety of tools and best practices that can help automate and refine these pipelines and keep organizations on the right path.

Web scraping applications and AI
Web scraping involves writing a software robot that can automatically collect data from various webpages. Simple bots might get the job done, but more sophisticated bots use AI to find the appropriate data on a page and copy it to the appropriate data field to be processed by an analytics application.
AI web scraping-based use cases include e-commerce, labor research, supply chain analytics, enterprise data capture and market research, said Sarah Petrova, co-founder at Techtestreport. These kinds of applications rely heavily on data and the syndication of data from different parties. Commercial applications use web scraping to do sentiment analysis about new product launches, curate structured data sets about companies and products, simplify business process integration and predictively gather data.
One specific web scraping project includes curating language data for non-English natural language processing (NLP) models or capturing sports statistics for building new AI models for fantasy sports analysis. Burak Özdemir, a web developer based in Turkey, used web scraping to build a neural network model for NLP tasks in Turkish.



Though web scraping has existed for a long time, the use of AI for web extraction has become a game changer.


Sayid ShabeerChief product officer, HighRadius




""Although there are so many pretrained models that can be found online for English, it's much harder to find a decent data set for other languages,"" Özdemir said. He has been experimenting with scraping Wikipedia and other platforms that have structured text to train and test his models -- and his work can provide a framework for others looking to develop and train NLP in non-English languages.


The tools of web scraping
There is a variety of tools and libraries that developers can use to jumpstart their web scraping projects. Primarily, Python has web scraping technology readily available via online libraries.
Python plays a significant role in AI development with focus on web scraping, Petrova said. She recommended considering libraries like Beautiful Soup, lxml, MechanicalSoup, Python Requests, Scrapy, Selenium and urllib.
Each tool has its own strength and they can often complement one another. For example, Scrapy is an open source and collaborative framework for extracting data that is useful for data mining, monitoring and automated testing. Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. Petrova said she deploys it for modeling scrape scripts as the library provides simple methods and Pythonic idioms for navigating, searching and modifying a parse tree.


Augmenting data with web scraping
AI algorithms are often developed on the front end to learn which sections of a webpage contain fields such as product data, review or price. Petrova noted that combining web scraping with AI, the process of data augmentation can become more efficient.
""Web scraping, especially smart, AI-driven, data extraction, cleansing, normalization and aggregation solutions, can significantly reduce the amount of time and resources organizations have to invest in data gathering and preparation relative to solution development and delivery,"" said Julia Wiedmann, machine learning research engineer, at Diffbot, a structured web search service.
Petrova said common data augmentation techniques include:

extrapolation (relevant fields are updated or provided with values);
tagging (common records are tagged to a group, making it easier to understand and differentiate for the group);
aggregation (using mathematical values of averages and means -- values are estimated for relevant fields, if needed); and
probability techniques (based on heuristics and analytical statistics -- values are populated based on the probability of events).



Using AI for resilient scraping
Websites are built to be human-readable and not machine-readable, which makes it hard to extract at scale and across different page layouts. Anyone who has tried to aggregate and maintain data knows what a difficult task this can be -- whether it be a manually compiled database with typos, missing fields, and duplicates or the variability of online content publication practices, Wiedmann said.
Her team has developed AI algorithms that use the same cues as a human to detect the information that should be scraped. She has also found that it is important to integrate outputs into applied research or test environments first. There can be hidden variability tied to the publication practices of the sources. Data quality assurance routines can help minimize the manual data maintenance.
""Designing systems that minimize the amount of manual maintenance will reduce errors and data misuse,"" Wiedmann said.


Improving data structure
AI can also structure data collected with web scraping to improve the way it can be used by other applications.
""Though web scraping has existed for a long time, the use of AI for web extraction has become a game changer,"" said Sayid Shabeer, chief product officer at HighRadius, an AI software company.
Traditional web scraping can't extract structured data from unstructured documents automatically, but recent advancements built AI algorithms that work in data extraction in a similar fashion to humans and that continue to learn as well. Shabeer's team used these types of bots for extracting remittance information for cash applications from retail partners. The web aggregation engine regularly logs into retailer websites and looks for remittance information. Once the information becomes available, the virtual agents automatically capture the remittance data and provide it in a digital format.
From there, a set of rules can be applied to further enhance the quality of data and bundle it with the payment information. AI models allow the bots to master a variety of tasks rather than have them focus on just one process.
To build these bots, Shabeer's team collated the common class names and HTML tags that are used on various retailer's websites and fed these into the AI engine. This was used as training data to ensure that the AI engine could handle any new retailer portals that were being added with minimal to no manual intervention. Over time, the engine became more and more capable of extracting data without any intervention.


Limitations of web scraping
In a recent case in which LinkedIn tried to prevent HiQ Labs from scraping its data for analytics purposes, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that web scraping for analytics and AI can be legal. However, there are still a variety of ways that websites may not intentionally or accidentally break web scraping applications.
Petrova said that some of the common limitations she has encountered include:

Scraping at scale. Scraping a single page is straightforward, but there are challenges in scraping millions of websites, including managing the codebase, collecting data and maintaining a data warehouse.
Pattern changes. Each website periodically changes its user interface.
Anti-scraping technologies. Some websites use anti-scraping technologies.
JavaScript-based dynamic content. Websites that heavily rely on JavaScript and Ajax to render dynamic content makes data extraction difficult.
Honeypot traps. Some website designers put honeypot traps inside websites to detect web spiders and deliver false information. This can involve generating links that normal users can't see but crawlers can.
Quality of data. Records that do not meet the quality guidelines will affect the overall integrity of the data.



Browser vs. back end
Web scraping is generally done by a headless browser that can scour webpages independent of any human activity. However, there are AI chatbot add-ons that scrape data as a background process running in the browser that can help users find new information. These front-end programs use AI to decide how to communicate the appropriate information to a user.
Marc Sloan, co-founder and CEO at Scout, an AI web scraping chatbot, said they originally did this by using a headless browser in Python that pulled webpage content via a network of proxies. Information was extracted from the content using a variety of techniques. Sloan and his team used Spacy to extract entities and relations from unstructured text into knowledge graphs using Neo4j. Convolutional networks were used to identify features such as session type, session similarity and session endpoints.
They have since moved the processing into the user's browser itself running in JavaScript to preserve privacy. And in order to run better in the browser, they have simplified the data models. Sloan said he believes this is only the beginning. The development of different kinds of AI agents that run locally to help people automate their interactions with various sites is only going to continue in the future.

Tertiary institutions are increasingly using artificial intelligence and students' personal information to spot students who are at risk of dropping out.

The measures are part of a national push to dramatically reduce long-standing failure rates, particularly among Māori and Pasifika students.
This year University of Canterbury began using a new computer system it developed to spot struggling students before they failed papers or dropped out altogether.
The university's deputy vice-chancellor academic, Catherine Moran, said it was using machine learning to monitor what students were doing in their courses.
""We use machine learning, an artificial intelligence system, that pulls in all the data for the students as they're doing their work online,"" she said.
""So for instance, whether they're watching a lecture, or whether they're doing a discussion with their classmates or whether they're reading the notes from their lectures. Everything on the learning management platform, that information all gets pulled into the AI machine and it creates a pattern of what the students are doing for each course.
""If a student falls outside the expected amount, if they're not engaging at all, if they're not clicking on to their LEARN page, not looking at their notes, we can see that. That triggers an alert and the students get a text immediately.""
The text would remind students to log into their course, and if they did not within a couple of days, they would be sent a second text and university staff would follow up in person.
The system flagged 1000 students this year and a mixture of text messages and personal contact got most of them back on track very quickly, she said.
Twenty of the students needed intensive support or counselling, but Moran said even a single text message could make a huge difference to a student's prospects.
""For some of them, they just weren't sure how to navigate some of the systems, they got a little bit lost around logging in, they didn't like their courses and so a few of them did actually come back and say 'well thanks, I had kind of given up'.""
The move from school to first-year study was a big change that many students found difficult.
Nationally, about 20 percent of first year students dropped out and the university hoped it could dramatically reduce that.
Waikato Institute of Technology was developing its own alert system to identify students who might need help.
Its executive director of products and planning Warwick Pitts said it had already identified that personal factors played a big role in student success and during the lockdown had checked in with students every 10 days to find out how they were going.
""We're asking students around how they're coping financially, what's their learning environment at home like, how are they balancing study and home commitments.
""Those data points are then going to be plugged into the system to be able to give us that fuller version of what student need is, or risk, just beyond grades and are they attending classes.""
Pitts said the institute had also overhauled the way it provided support for students.
Students no longer had to go to a special office to access academic support - instead those staff were based in classes with students.
""We've also introduced a tuakana/teina model where students that have successfully completed the course come back and help coach and mentor other students during that semester. And we're seeing for those learners a 10 to 15 percent higher course completion rate.""
Tertiary Education Commission's deputy chief executive, learner success, Paora Ammunson said the institute's work was new and exciting.
""It's building on the work that all tertiary providers will have done around understanding their students, but what we're doing for New Zealand now is taking that to a newer level and really deeply understanding what is driving attrition, and the times attrition that occurs and how we can intervene to stop that happening,"" he said.
The commission was also supporting the University of Waikato, Te Wananga o Raukawa, and Manukau Institute of Technology to trial new ways of working with students.
""This is a key part part of our wider New Zealand goals of supporting Māori achievement, Pasifika achievement, supporting the achievement of New Zealanders with disabilities,"" he said.
The biggest disparity in the tertiary education system was in degree completion, where the gap between Māori and Pasifika students and other learners was about 16-18 percent, Ammunson said.
It was clear that students who were the first in their families to do tertiary study needed more support right from the start of their enrolment, he said.
""That transition from high school to tertiary and the first year experience is where the biggest gains can be made.""
