Large language models (LLMs) are a paradigm-changing innovation in data science. They extend the capabilities of machine learning models to generating relevant text and images in response to a wide array of qualitative prompts. While these tools are expensive and difficult to build, multitudes of users can use them quickly and cheaply to perform some of the language-based tasks that only humans could do before.
This raises the possibility that many human jobs — particularly knowledge-intensive jobs that primarily involve working with text or code — could be replaced or significantly undercut by widespread adoption of this technology. But in reality, LLMs are much more complicated to use effectively in an organizational context than is typically acknowledged, and they have yet to demonstrate that they can satisfactorily perform all of the tasks that knowledge workers execute in any given job.

LLMs in Organizations
Most of the potential areas of use for LLMs center on manipulating existing information, much of it specific to an individual organization. This includes summarizing content and producing reports (which represents 35% of use cases, according to one survey) and extracting information from documents, such as PDFs containing financial information, and creating tables from them (33% of use cases).1 Other popular and effective uses of LLMs include creating images with tools like Dall-E 2 or generating synthetic data for applications when real data is difficult to obtain, such as data to train voice recognition tools like Amazon’s Alexa.2
Most organizations using LLMs are still in the exploration phase. Customer interactions, knowledge management, and software engineering are three areas of extensive organizational experiments with generative AI. For example, Audi recruited a vendor to build and deploy a customized LLM-based chatbot that would answer employees’ questions about available documentation, customer details, and risk evaluations. The chatbot retrieves relevant information from a variety of proprietary databases in real time and is supposed to avoid answering questions if the available data is insufficient. The company used prompt engineering tools developed by Amazon Web Services for retrieval augmented generation (RAG), a common customization procedure that uses organization-specific data without requiring changes to the underlying foundation model.

Generative AI has emerged as a transformational force in computing, but it’s not always clear how to utilize it when designing new products. At Microsoft, our teams are learning how to incorporate Microsoft Copilot and other new AI technology into their everyday work.
Our UX designers and managers in Microsoft Digital (MSD), the company’s IT organization, are on the cutting edge of the shift that AI is bringing to modern engineering. And we’re now able to share their in-the-trenches observations on how generative AI is and will change the way they work.
Immediate impact
One of the first dramatic changes we’ve seen since incorporating generative AI into our workflows, is that our product designers no longer need to create mockups of every screen in a product—now there’s a better way.
Now it’s like creating a book where the pages are always changing. At the critical junction in the UX, where humans interact with Copilot, the AI transforms into the conductor of the user experience. This shift is enabling our designers to move away from defining fixed flows to embracing a non-deterministic design style orchestrated by the AI.
—Yannis Paniaras, principal designer, Microsoft Digital Studio

“Now it’s like creating a book where the pages are always changing,” says Yannis Paniaras, a principal designer in the Microsoft Digital Studio. “At the critical junction in the UX, where humans interact with Copilot, the AI transforms into the conductor of the user experience. This shift is enabling our designers to move away from defining fixed flows to embracing a non-deterministic design style orchestrated by the AI.”
Microsoft Digital Studio is our team of designers and researchers in MSD. The MSD Studio team is committed to using their expertise in design, research, content strategy, accessibility, and product planning to create experiences that empower Microsoft employees to achieve more in their lives.
Paniaras has observed that designing an AI-enabled product is very different from designing a traditional desktop or mobile app. In conversations with designers, program managers, and developers, he frequently encounters questions about how various product-making disciplines should coordinate their work in this new context.
“We have Copilot, powered by a large language model (LLM), and we use Fluent AI design language for experiences that rely on lean graphical user interfaces with dynamic prompts and dynamically generated, contextual cards,” Paniaras says. “These provide just-in-time user interface elements that map to the generative flow. Consequently, designers are shifting their focus from standard UI towards the vocabulary of prompts, dynamically designed adaptive cards, and on finding consistency withing the UX context. These elements are becoming the new building blocks of AI-based UX design.”
The MSD Studio team’s designers still work in Figma, the popular design and prototyping tool, but their designs need to remain open-ended and sometimes more abstract, rather than a set of fixed linear designs.
With all the power of generative AI, user experience and design are still responsible for the quality of the experience and the outcome, so we’re finding ways to scale working with engineering and data science.
—Laura Bergstrom, principal UX manager, Unified Employee Experience team

“The design becomes a set of probabilities,” Paniaras says. “While this poses a challenge for designers, it also encourages us to collaborate more closely with everyone else.”
Laura Bergstrom, a principal UX manager for the Unified Employee Experience team, adds that content designers and designers on her team developed guidance for engineers to scale Copilot responses creating consistent, reliable responses with the right tone of voice at the right time.
“With all the power of generative AI, user experience and design are still responsible for the quality of the experience and the outcome, so we’re finding ways to scale working with engineering and data science,” Bergstrom says.
Spurring collaboration with AI
Using AI to quickly align plans and goals is causing a shift in the way the entire product-making crew works together. “All the different disciplines are working together to get things in place,” Paniaras says.
He tells a story of a designer who worked concurrently with PMs and engineers to design prompts, comparing it with the previous way of doing things.
“It used to be different: you had research, based on that you would have ideas, prototype certain things, build them, then engineers would test them,” Paniaras says. “It was more linear.”
I need to figure out what the user wants. When we build an application, I need to know where they are coming from, what they want to do, and where the experience that we’re building for them will break down.
—Victor Albahadly, senior UX designer in MSD Studio

Modern engineering with AI requires a shift to a more collaborative culture on product teams, where there aren’t clear lines of ownership and people can work flexibly together. It’s similar to the shift that engineering went through from the waterfall approach to agile, when instead of owning specific pieces, engineers swarmed over one part of the product for a sprint, then swarmed on another part in the next sprint.
 
We’re shifting from a fixed, traditional UX approach to AI-influenced UX. With traditional UX, the UI is central and static, mapping out all possible user interactions. The surrounding UX context has a minor role, not influencing the UI dynamically. In AI UX, the UI is minimized, signifying a responsive and adaptive approach that relies on AI for real-time user interaction. Here, the UX context is amplified, reflecting the system’s capacity to accommodate various user environments, thereby shaping a more tailored experience.




Streamlining design with AI
AI is helping us test our designs more fully and to ship them more quickly. Here are some of our top tips for doing the same at your company.
 

Personalized Recommendations: AI can analyze user behavior and preferences, providing designers with insights to create personalized user experiences tailored to individual needs.
Efficient Prototyping: AI-powered tools can automate prototyping processes, speeding up design iterations and allowing designers to explore multiple concepts more efficiently.
Data-Driven Decision Making: By leveraging AI analytics, designers can make informed decisions based on user data, ensuring that design choices are backed by insights into user interactions and preferences.
User Behavior Prediction: AI algorithms can predict user behavior patterns, helping designers anticipate user actions and design interfaces that align with user expectations, ultimately enhancing user satisfaction.
Accessibility Integration: AI can assist designers in creating more accessible designs by identifying potential accessibility issues and suggesting improvements, ensuring that digital products are inclusive and user-friendly for all.




Victor Albahadly, a senior UX designer in MSD Studio, says AI has potential to transform the way he does his core job, which is to test to find out where the designs he and his team build breakdown and fail to meet the needs of the people who will use them.
“I need to figure out what the user wants,” Albahadly says. “When we build an application, I need to know where they are coming from, what they want to do, and where the experience that we’re building for them will break down.”
The challenge is that he has to sample the experiences users have with his designs and extrapolate what he learns to the rest of the design. And importantly, he does this at scale—not for just one person, but for all the people who use the application.
“I need to test how the experience will work for many people,” he says. “That’s an intense process.”
AI has the potential to change that because it will be able to see everything—something a human will never be able to do on their own.
“With AI’s help, someday in the near future, I’ll be able to test the entire application,” Albahadly says. “There will be a lot of power in that.”
AI can help designers get this kind of scale at every step in the process, which not only makes the results far more accurate, but also much faster.
The future of ideation




Boosting user flow and telemetry with AI
AI is helping us figure out where our designs breakdown much more quickly. Here’s what we’ve learned along the way.
 

Behavioral Analytics: AI can continuously analyze user interactions within the app or website, providing insights into user behavior, preferences, and patterns.
Predictive Modeling: By employing machine learning algorithms, AI can predict user actions, allowing designers to anticipate potential pain points and optimize the user flow proactively.
A/B Testing Automation: AI can automate the A/B testing process, experimenting with different user flows and suggesting improvements based on real-time user feedback and performance metrics.
Personalization Algorithms: Utilizing AI-driven personalization, the system can adapt user flows based on individual preferences, creating a more tailored and engaging experience for each user.
Dynamic User Journey Mapping: AI can dynamically map user journeys, identifying bottlenecks or areas of improvement in the current flow and proposing adjustments for a smoother and more intuitive user experience.




 
Albahadly also envisions AI enhancing parts of the design process. Today, ideation is done by talking to experts and customers, holding brainstorming sessions, and doing workshops. In the future, he suggests he could do similar ideation with his teammates and AI.
“In your app, say there’s a huge drop-off of traffic coming from Japan,” he says. “Now we need to do a workshop to find out why this is happening. The AI could point to specific stuff like a language barrier or culture barrier, or a time issue like a holiday. Instead of taking a week to ideate, it could become a step in the process the same day.”
In addition to changes in design processes, generative AI is changing the user experience.
“We’ve had a linear way of pumping out experiences—an OS, products on top of it, and apps,” Bergstrom says. “Now there are different copilots, different extensibility, ways of doing things on surfaces. This all has to make sense to a user end-to-end.”
 
Human designers can only sample the experience users have with experiences they build—they can’t test every scenario because that takes far too long. AI is going to change that because, after it’s fully deployed in the UX space, it will be able to test every use case.
It requires a lot of design thinking to produce that experience.
Data quality is also crucial to producing an experience that makes sense. “Generative AI is a wildcard, which requires data to be more pristine,” Bergstrom says.
For example, the LLM for Microsoft 365 can go through all your emails and SharePoint sites. If you type in “benefits,” it should identify the authoritative source and display that information—not go through your email to find every benefits-related message you’ve ever gotten.
Transforming work with AI
What about the potential of AI to do routine, repetitive work and give people the time to do higher value work? Bergstrom sees a wide range of opportunities.
“We can use generative AI to help employees with everyday tasks, from finding the best place to park to managing the immigration process to identifying the best selections for employee benefits,” Bergstrom says. “And for large enterprises, we can use generative AI to help manage facilities by identifying cost-to-benefit ratios, building usage, and for finding the best locations to have offices.”
Both Bergstrom and Albahadly see an opportunity for AI to help employees write their performance reviews. Bergstrom notes that it could help managers combine review feedback from multiple sources and tie it to OKRs.
And Albahadly says that for employees, AI can help with writing their own performance reviews.
“That’s been a challenge for most Microsoft employees, because at the end of the year, you have to sit and remember everything you worked on,” he says.
Because AI will be exposed to your meetings, your calendar, your projects, it will be easy for it to co-write your review with you.
“In the future, it will be less writing and more selecting stuff, and AI will generate a whole year for you,” Albahadly says.
With all this transformation happening, some people worry about the future of work.
Paniaras is optimistic.
“Everything around us, including our roles, work, processes, and definitions of values, has been created by us humans” he says. “Whenever any of these dimensions change, we inevitably end up redefining them or filling the void. But you need to have that thinking attitude, and the recognition that everything around us is a result of our own making.”
Bergstrom agrees.
“Durable problems don’t change,” she says. “But now we have infinitesimally more ways to solve for those problems with an intelligent assistant that can anticipate needs and predicts possibilities—we’re just trying to figure out how to harness all the capability in our designs.”

Recognize that AI has limitations—it can’t replace human intuition, empathy, or domain expertise. Use it as a tool to enhance your creativity.


Design for adaptability and personalization:

AI-driven UX should be adaptable and personalized. Create interfaces that adjust dynamically based on user behavior, context, and preferences.
Use AI to tailor experiences for individual users, providing relevant content and recommendations.


Collect and curate data:

AI models require data to learn and improve. Collect relevant user data (with privacy considerations) to train AI algorithms.
Curate high-quality datasets that represent diverse user scenarios and behaviors.


Iterate and refine AI models:

Start with simple AI models and gradually increase complexity. Iterate based on user feedback and real-world usage.
Regularly evaluate and fine-tune AI models to ensure they align with user needs and business goals.


Ethical considerations:

Be mindful of biases in AI algorithms. Ensure fairness, transparency, and inclusivity.
Understand the ethical implications of AI-driven decisions and design accordingly.


Learn from existing AI-driven products:

Study successful AI-powered products and services. Analyze how they integrate AI seamlessly into the user experience.
Learn from industry leaders and adapt their best practices to your own projects.



Remember, AI is a powerful tool, but it’s most effective when combined with human creativity and empathy. By embracing AI and understanding its role, UX designers can create innovative, personalized, and adaptive experiences for users.

Candidates are trying to beat the systemAlaina Demopoulos in New YorkWed 6 Mar 2024 07.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 6 Mar 2024 21.31 ESTShareWhen Ty landed an introductory phone interview with a finance and banking company last month, they assumed it would be a quick chat with a recruiter. And when they got on the phone, Ty assumed the recruiter, who introduced herself as Jaime, was human. But things got robotic.“The voice sounded similar to Siri,” said Ty, who is 29 and lives in the DC metro area. “It was creepy.”Ty realized they weren’t speaking to a living, breathing person. Their interviewer was an AI system, and one with a rather rude habit. Jaime asked Ty all the right questions – what’s your management style? are you a good fit for this role? – but she wouldn’t let Ty fully answer them.“After cutting me off, the AI would respond, ‘Great! Sounds good! Perfect!’ and move on to the next question,” Ty said. “After the third or fourth question, the AI just stopped after a short pause and told me that the interview was completed and someone from the team would reach out later.” (Ty asked that their last name not be used because their current employer doesn’t know they’re looking for a job.)A survey from Resume Builder released last summer found that by 2024, four in 10 companies would use AI to “talk with” candidates in interviews. Of those companies, 15% said hiring decisions would be made with no input from a human at all.In person, you get more social prompts. In this case, I was just talking to myselfAdele WaltonAs Laura Michelle Davis wrote for CNET: “Today, it’s not uncommon for applicants to be rejected by a robot before they’re connected with an actual human in human resources.” To make the grueling process of getting hired even more demoralizing, many people are afraid generative AI – which uses data sets to create text, video, audio, images and yes, robo-recruiters – will take our jobs altogether. But could AI help us find a new gig in the meantime?The human element is lostAsk an employer who uses AI in their hiring process about the choice, and they’ll share a common refrain: these systems are used to cross quotidian tasks off a recruiter’s daily schedule; AI helps weed through the top 1,000 applicants, but once you get to the top 10, it’s a strictly human process.In 2019, ZipRecruiter noted that AI systems could streamline boring tasks – like writing job descriptions or scanning résumés – and give hiring professionals “back time to spend on more strategic tasks”. (Imagine how it feels to be on the other side, applying to dozens of jobs a day.) A survey conducted in 2020, sponsored by the AI interview system Sapia.ai, found that 55% of companies were increasing investment in automated recruiting measures.“I do not use AI to write job descriptions, but I know many employers who do,” said Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter. Pollak said that a manager might also ask an AI program to give them a list of reasons why they should, or should not, hire a final-round candidate. “Employers use it as a coach, as a guide, as a friend to bounce ideas off,” she added.View image in fullscreenAdele Walton was recently interviewed by AI. Photograph: Courtesy Adele WaltonBut, as applicants like Ty now know, employers’ use of AI goes beyond it being a sounding board.Experts advise applicants to act as though they’re speaking to a human during AI-led interviews, although that’s easier said than done. Adele Walton, a 24-year-old journalist and content creator from Brighton, England, recently sat through an AI interview that felt extremely unnatural. “I expected a person or a panel,” she said. “When I clicked on the call, I was surprised to enter a chat room with just myself.”Questions flashed on a screen that also showed her own face. Walton had 60 seconds to answer. “I was looking at how my face was moving, looking at how I looked on screen,” she said. “As someone who’s struggled with body dysmorphia, I found that my face was an unnecessary distraction in the interview process. I know I would have done better if there was another person there.”Walton did not get another interview. “In an in-person meeting, you get more social prompts from the other person,” she said. “In this case, I was just talking to myself – or an AI system – with no measure of how well I was doing. I couldn’t read anyone’s face, body language, or see them nod yes. That small type of human reassurance that you get in a real interview is completely lost when companies outsource interviews to AI.”Applicants are gaming the systemIf employers use AI to make their hiring process easier, why shouldn’t applicants? That’s Fanta-Marie Touré’s mindset. The 24-year-old, who lives in Atlanta and works in cybersecurity, has used AI tools to tailor her résumé, write cover letters and even auto-apply to jobs. She does this through a program called Massive.“It’s very expensive to hire someone to help you with your résumé,” Touré said. “A lot of people charge $150 an hour to do résumé reviews. That’s a lot, so why not use a tool that costs me maybe $30 a month?”Touré maintains that it’s still important to “personalize” application materials – adding relevant anecdotes, for example. “Otherwise, everybody who uses AI is getting the same result,” she said. “You have to tweak.”Sometimes, supposed hacks on how to game the AI recruitment process hit social media. A few years ago, Touré heard one trick: a TikTok creator advised applicants to copy and paste a job description on to their résumés, and then change the font of that description to a tiny size that matched the résumé’s white background. A human wouldn’t be able to see it, but AI would scan it, recognize the text verbatim and send it to the front of the pack. Or so the theory went.View image in fullscreenA 2019 survey found that by 2024, four in 10 companies would use AI to ‘talk with’ candidates in interviews. Photograph: AsiaVision/Getty Images“I never got any hits from that,” Touré said. “That was a couple of years ago, and I bet the systems are smarter now.”It’s a move that’s familiar to Pollak, the ZipRecruiter economist. “That tactic has been used so widely that most job site algorithms now know to penalize it. Don’t try to be too smart with your résumé: if a match is too close, it will be kicked out.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to TechScapeFree weekly newsletterAlex Hern's weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.after newsletter promotionAccording to Pollak, employers are more suspicious of AI-generated résumés and cover letters these days. “I’m hearing that employers are now discounting a lot of the information they receive that’s in written form, and want to get to a face-to-face conversation as quickly as possible with the candidates so they can properly vet them,” she explained.Even on video interviews – with humans or robots – applicants can still call on AI programs to assist. Michael G is the founder of Final Round AI, an “interview co-pilot” that listens to recruiters’ questions and prompts personalized answers in real time, based on the résumé and cover letter uploaded by the interviewee. (Michael asked that his last name not be used because Final Round AI is still in “stealth mode”, a startup’s temporary state of secretiveness to quell competition.)“Users can quickly glance through the AI’s response, and then develop their own response to the question,” Michael said. “It’s not like they need to read the text verbatim off the screen. It’s natural: you have celebrities, TV hosts looking at teleprompters all the time. Why can’t ordinary people use a teleprompter?”According to Michael, Final Round AI has over half a million users, some of whom send him job offers they credit in part to the service. (That’s tough to factcheck – Final Round AI has less than 2,000 followers across its social platforms.) Michael added that about 40% of users come from the tech industry, and 30% work in the banking or finance fields. The cost to use it can range from $0 to $100 a month. Michael says all personal data is deleted at the end of the call, but generally, AI systems learn from the data they are fed over time.Is it cheating? “I believe that because of AI, there are new boundaries and it’s hard to define whether someone is cheating or not,” Michael said, somewhat terrifyingly. “And, if I were an employer, I would prefer candidates who know how to use AI, because they bring value and a productivity boost to the company.”Michael said he used Final Round AI at points while answering questions for this interview; yes, you could tell.Who’s hit the hardest by AI hiring?AI systems encode bias. You don’t need to be a wildly imaginative person to consider how that might affect job-seekers – Amazon reportedly scrapped an in-house hiring algorithm, trained on data submitted by applicants, that favored men and penalized résumés that included the word “women”. Will automated hiring processes also reject people who are not white, male and able-bodied?AI won’t pick a CEORory Mir of the Electronic Frontier Foundation“The current wave of AI uses algorithms that are probabilistic models, which means they simply rely on patterns in past data to make likely predictions,” said Rory Mir, associate director of community organizing at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “The problem is, patterns in past data include the patterns which emerge from systemic bias.”Racial bias is present when humans do the hiring: studies have found that hiring managers are likely to pass over names that are perceived as Black while reviewing résumés. Pollak said that to avoid such bias, ZipRecruiter strips “any kind of identifiable information” like names and zip codes from résumés before putting them through an AI system. But if a résumé still includes education, AI systems could theoretically learn to favor applicants who went to Ivy League schools. Pollak defended the practice of retaining education because “employers do want to know something like [that]”.‘Disinformation on steroids’: is the US prepared for AI’s influence on the election?Read moreHigher-ups in the corporate world rarely apply for jobs – at a certain pay grade, you network instead. Mir believes that early-stage or low-level applicants will “bear the brunt” of AI hiring: “AI won’t pick a CEO. It might filter applicants for management, and it may have the final say on hiring a gig worker,” they said. “Automated hiring will have an outsized impact on marginalized folks who rely on more precarious lines of work.”Case in point: 404 Media recently reported on a company called Paradox.ai, used by FedEx, McDonald’s and the company that operates Olive Garden, which recruited people in customer and food service jobs with a “long and bizarre personality quiz” illustrated with “blue humanoid aliens”. The goal was to discover how candidates “rank in terms of ‘agreeableness’ and ‘emotional stability’”.Ty never heard back from anyone at the company after speaking with its AI recruiter; they assume they won’t. They aren’t surprised that the interview process is becoming more artificial.“I’ve been in interviews where human recruiters ask me directly how I feel about using apps like ChatGPT for creative work, and if I would feel comfortable doing that at my job,” they said. “So I guess it was only a matter of time before I got straight-up interviewed by a robot.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Job huntingfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewedSunday was world’s hottest ever recorded day, data suggestsWhen a bad Trump joke becomes an affair of state, Germany has lost more than its sense of humourFatma Aydemir‘We pledged not to eat each other’: the family that was shipwrecked for 38 daysWho might Kamala Harris pick for VP?

Since its release in November 2022, OpenAI's ChatGPT has been used to write cover letters, create a children's book, and even help students cheat on their essays. The chatbot may be more powerful than we ever imagined. Google found that, in theory, the search engine would hire the bot as an entry-level coder if it interviewed at the company.Amazon employees who tested ChatGPT said it does a ""very good job"" of answering customer support questions, is ""great"" at making training documents, and is ""very strong"" at answering queries around corporate strategy.

Companies are taking notice. Both IBM and British telecommunications giant BT Group cited AI when announcing job cuts last year — and said that many wouldn't come back.

A Goldman Sachs study from last year found that generative AI tools could, in fact, impact 300 million full-time jobs worldwide, which could lead to a ""significant disruption"" in the job market.By 2030, nearly 12 million Americans in occupations with shrinking demand may need to switch jobs, a McKinsey analysis published last July. AI was deemed a key reason — McKinsey estimated that 30% of hours worked in the US could be automated by 2030.Human judgment needs to be applied to these technologies to avoid error and bias, Anu Madgavkar, a partner at the McKinsey Global Institute, previously told Business Insider. Users of ChatGPT have found that the bot can generate misinformation, incorrectly answer coding problems, and produce errors in basic math.""We have to think about these things as productivity-enhancing tools, as opposed to complete replacements,"" Madgavkar said.

Business Insider talked to experts and conducted research to compile a list of jobs that are at the highest risk for replacement by AI.

Tech jobs (Coders, computer programmers, software engineers, data analysts)











Coders, software developers, and data analysts could be displaced by AI, an expert says.
 
                                            Jens Schlueter/Getty Images
                                          




Coding and computer programming are in-demand skills, but it's possible that ChatGPT and similar AI tools may fill in some of the gaps in the near future. Tech jobs such as software developers, web developers, computer programmers, coders, and data scientists are ""pretty amenable"" to AI technologies ""displacing more of their work,"" Madgavkar said.That's because AI like ChatGPT is good at crunching numbers with relative accuracy.In fact, advanced technologies like ChatGPT could produce code faster than humans, which means that work can be completed with fewer employees, Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute who has researched AI's impact on the American workforce, told Business Insider.""What took a team of software developers might only take some of them,"" he added.Tech companies like ChatGPT maker's OpenAI have already considered replacing software engineers with AI.Still, Oded Netzer, a Columbia Business School professor, said he thinks that AI will help coders rather than replace them. ""In terms of jobs, I think it's primarily an enhancer than full replacement of jobs,"" Netzer told CBS MoneyWatch last year. ""Coding and programming is a good example of that. It actually can write code quite well.""

Media jobs (advertising, content creation, technical writing, journalism)











Experts say AI like ChatGPT is good at producing written content and can do so ""more efficiently than humans.""
 
                                            Westend61/Getty Images
                                          




Media jobs across the board — including those in advertising, technical writing, journalism, and any role that involves content creation — could be affected by ChatGPT and similar forms of AI, Madgavkar said. That's because AI is able to read, write, and understand text-based data well, she added.""Analyzing and interpreting vast amounts of language based data and information is a skill that you'd expect generative AI technologies to ramp up on,"" Madgavkar said. Economist Paul Krugman said in a New York Times op-ed published in December 2022 that ChatGPT may be able to do tasks like reporting and writing ""more efficiently than humans.""The media industry has already begun experimenting with AI-generated content. Tech news site CNET used an AI tool similar to ChatGPT to write dozens of articles — though the publisher had to issue a number of corrections — and BuzzFeed has used tech from the ChatGPT maker to generate new forms of content like quizzes and travel guides.But Madgavkar said that the majority of work done by content creators is not automatable.""There's a ton of human judgment that goes into each of these occupations,"" she said.

Legal industry jobs (paralegals, legal assistants)











AI can replicate some of the work that paralegals and legal assistants do, though they aren't entirely replaceable, experts say.
 
                                            Worawee Meepian/Shutterstock
                                          




Generative AI could impact legal workers in the US, a March Goldman Sachs report found.That's because legal services jobs had already been highly exposed to AI automation before the advent of new AI tools, Manav Raj, an author of the Goldman study, told Business Insider. Like media roles, jobs in the legal industry such as paralegals and legal assistants are responsible for consuming large amounts of information, synthesizing what they learned, then making it digestible through a legal brief or opinion. Language-oriented roles like these are susceptible to automation, Madgavkar said.""The data is actually quite structured, very language-oriented, and therefore quite amenable to generative AI,"" she added.But again, AI won't fully be able to automate these jobs since it requires a degree of human judgement to understand what a client or employer wants.""It's almost like a bit of a productivity boost that some of these occupations might get, because you can use tools that actually do this better,"" Madgavkar said.

Market research analysts











Market research analysts are susceptible to AI-driven change, says an expert.
 
                                            Laurence Dutton/Getty Images
                                          




AI is good at analyzing data and predicting outcomes, Muro said. That is why market research analysts may be susceptible to AI-driven change. Market research analysts are responsible for collecting data, identifying trends within that data, and then using what they found to design an effective marketing campaign or decide where to place advertising. ""Those are things that we're now seeing that AI could handle,"" Muro said.

Teachers











Even teachers are susceptible to job disruptions from AI.
 
                                            Getty Images
                                          




Teachers across the country are worried about students using ChatGPT to cheat on their homework, but according to Pengcheng Shi, an associate dean in the Department of Computing and Information Sciences at Rochester Institute of Technology, they should also be thinking about their job security. ChatGPT ""can easily teach classes already,"" Shi told the New York Post.""Although it has bugs and inaccuracies in terms of knowledge, this can be easily improved,"" he said. ""Basically, you just need to train the ChatGPT.""But Shannon Ahern, a high school math and science teacher who said she used ChatGPT to do things like lesson planning, told Business Insider last year that she's not worried she'll be replaced by the tech.""There will always be a need for us and the human connection that comes with in-person instruction,"" she said.

Finance jobs (Financial analysts, personal financial advisors)











Workers in the finance industry could be at risk for AI replacement, expert says.

Like market research analysts, financial analysts, personal financial advisors, and other jobs in personal finance that require manipulating significant amounts of numerical data can be affected by AI, Muro, the researcher at The Brookings Institution, said.""AI can identify trends in the market, highlight what investments in a portfolio are doing better and worse, communicate all that, and then use various other forms of data by, say, a financial company to forecast a better investment mix,"" Muro said. These analysts make a lot of money, he said, but parts of their jobs are automatable.

Experts say ChatGPT could upend jobs across a range of Wall Street industries, from trading to investment banking. ""It's going to automate select tasks that knowledge workers are engaged in today so that they can focus on higher-value tasks,"" Dylan Roberts, a partner at KPMG, told Business Insider.Pengcheng Shi, a dean at the Rochester Institute of Technology's computer science department, agreed that certain Wall Street roles could be in jeopardy.""At an investment bank, people are hired out of college, and spend two, three years to work like robots and do Excel modeling — you can get AI to do that,"" Shi told the New York Post.

In a Harvard Business Review post published in December 2022, three professors pointed to DALL-E, an AI tool that can generate images in seconds, as a potential disruptor of the graphic design industry.""Upskilling millions of people in their ability to create and manipulate images will have a profound impact on the economy,"" they wrote, adding that ""these recent advances in AI will surely usher in a period of hardship and economic pain for some whose jobs are directly impacted and who find it hard to adapt.""But Dr. Carl Benedikt Frey, an economist at Oxford University, told Business Insider that AI tools like ChatGPT may actually help workers in ""creative"" industries like art and graphic design produce higher quality work. Frey said he was more concerned about how the tech will impact wages.""In my view, it's less about automation,"" he said. ""It's more about democratization and competition, potentially leading to lower wages for people in some of these professions.""

Accounting is generally viewed as a stable profession, but even employees in this industry could be at risk.""Technology hasn't put everybody out of a job yet, but it does put some people out of a job,"" Brett Caraway, associate professor with the Institute of Communication, Culture, Information and Technology at the University of Toronto, said on Global News Radio 640 Toronto in January 2023.Caraway added that ""intellectual labor"" in particular could be threatened.""This could be lawyers, accountants,"" he said. ""It is something new, and it will be interesting to see just how disruptive and painful it is to employment and politics.""

You've probably already experienced calling or chatting with a company's customer service department and having a robot answer. ChatGPT and related technologies could continue this trend.A 2022 study from the tech research company Gartner predicted that chatbots will be the main customer service channel for roughly 25% of companies by 2027.

Generative AI is an utterly transformative technology that is already impacting how organizations and individuals work. But what does the future have in store for this incredible technology? Read on for my top predictions.


Multi-Modal Generative AIs
We now have generative AI tools that can see, hear, speak, read, write, or create. Increasingly, generative AIs will be able to do many of these things at once – such as being able to create text and images together. As an example, the third iteration of the text-to-image tool Dall-E is reportedly able to generate high-quality text embedded in its images, putting it ahead of rival image-generator tools. Then there was the 2023 announcement that ChatGPT can now see, hear, and speak, as well as write.

So, one of my predictions is that generative AIs will continue this move towards multi-modal AIs that can create in multiple ways – and in real-time, just like the human brain.

“Interactive AI”
PROMOTED
According to DeepMind cofounder Mustafa Suleyman, the next step beyond generative AI is “interactive AI"" – by which he means bots that don't just chat but can carry out all sorts of tasks by delegating to other software (and even people) to get stuff done for you.

Take software development as an example. Generative AI can already write and test computer code, meaning you could use it to build, say, a new recipe app designed around healthy eating. As AI becomes more interactive, you could, in theory, task an AI with the entire app-creation project – from writing and testing the code to hiring nutritionists, food photographers and recipe developers (some of whom may be bots), to liaising with beta testers, releasing the app, and organizing the marketing campaign. In a simpler example, you could ask a bot like ChatGPT to book a night away for you and your partner – including finding and booking the hotel, choosing a restaurant for you, booking a table (and informing the restaurant of your partner’s egg allergy), and booking a walking tour of the city. You could delegate the entire task to a bot.

So far, generative AI enables us to automate and augment cognitive and creative tasks, including some of the tasks done by doctors, designers, musicians, marketers, and more. Physical jobs such as building, assembly line work, cleaning, and so on are (by and large) unaffected by the wave of generative AI transformation. But combine generative AI with robots, and that may change. We could see AIs working in all sorts of sectors. On factory floors, for example, or construction sites, retail stores and hotels.

Generative AI For A Better World
I firmly believe that, as one of the most transformative technologies we’ve ever seen, generative AI may become a force for enormous good in this world. Yes, a tool like ChatGPT can be used to draft a funny speech for your friend's wedding or come up with an idea for tonight's supper. But it can also be used to address issues like climate change, massive inequality, hunger, access to healthcare, and more. It can help us find new treatments for diseases. It can democratize access to mental health support. It can predict how infectious diseases will progress. It can address food security through crop yield optimization. When you think about it, it's rather like giving humans superpowers.
Generative AI Regulation And Oversight
Of course, we can’t deny that generative AI can also be used to spread misinformation, create new biological weapons, or even build autonomous weapons that can identify and neutralize threats without any human oversight. This is why we will need regulation to protect us and ensure generative AI is used for positive transformation – and not to create more polarization, meddle in elections, deliberately spread false information, and the like. We will need transparency around how these systems are used. We will need ethical guidelines and frameworks in place. As such, generative AI will become a top priority for regulators.
To some extent, oversight is beginning to happen. Meta, for example, has announced that political ads running on Facebook and Instagram will be required to disclose if they contain AI-generated content and images. Other tech companies are following suit, which is good, but we also need formal regulations in place rather than just relying on tech companies to do the ethical thing.
AI Delegation And Making Work Better
Making the world a better place is one thing. But perhaps a humbler prediction is that generative AI will make work better. Yes, some jobs will be lost to AI automation. But more jobs will be augmented – enhanced – by generative AI. Because generative AI allows us to hand over the more mundane and repetitive tasks to machines, human workers will have more time for value-adding tasks like problem-solving, creativity, and relationship-building. But finding that balance between human expertise and machine intelligence will be crucial. As such, I expect AI delegation – or the art of working out which tasks are best left to machines and which should be done by humans – to become a vital future skill.

Does permitting the use of AI in employment call the works council into action? Not necessarily, says the German Labour Court
By Anna-Maria Hesse on March 5, 2024 Posted in Artificial Intelligence, Consultation, Data Protection, Monitoring, Privacy



The use of ChatGPT and its peers to make work easier and faster – whether permitted, tolerated or prohibited – is already part of everyday working life in many companies. However, the spread of that technology has raced far ahead of the law so the legal consequences of that use (employment rights and obligations, data protection, employee inventions, etc.) are in many cases still far from clear.
In one of the first judicial decisions in this area, the Hamburg Labour Court has recently addressed one particular question remaining unresolved around the use of AI and its consequences, the extent of the employer’s obligations to consult with works councils before AI is brought into the workplace. In its decision of 16 January 2024 (case no. 24 BVGa 1/24) the Court said that the works council has no right of co-determination pursuant to Section 87 (1) nos. 1, 6 and 7 Works Constitution Act where the employer chooses to permit the use of ChatGPT and comparable generative AI systems by staff using their own private web-based accounts, and to regulate that use by an AI policy. To be clear, a right of co-determination goes further than a right merely to be informed and consulted about workplace measures. Co-determination is the strongest form of the works council’s participation rights. In matters of co-determination the employer may not make decisions without the consent of the works council; instead, the works council must authorise any planned measures, or the parties must come to an agreement (e.g. a works agreement).
Background:
The employer decided to allow its employees to use generative AI as a new tool to support their work and published an AI Policy on its intranet stipulating terms and rules to be observed by employees in that use. These AI tools were accessible via a web browser and employees who wanted to use them had to obtain a private account (in this case, ChatGPT) at their own expense. The employer itself did not create a company AI tool. No doubt fearful of the possible longer-term impact of such tools on job security, the works council considered the consent to use ChatGPT and the publication of the AI Policy to be a gross violation of its co-determination and participation rights. Among other things, it requested the employer to block ChatGPT and prohibit its use.
Decision:
Use of AI tools does not concern “issues relating to the organization of the company and the orderly behaviour of employees in the company”
The Labour Court ruled that the works council’s right of co-determination under Section 87 (1) No. 1 Works Constitution Act was not affected, as generative AI systems constitute a work tool and therefore affect the work behaviour of the employees (which is not subject to co-determination) and not the orderly behaviour (which is subject to it).
Permission to use of AI tools not considered as “introduction and use of technical equipment designed to monitor the behaviour or performance of employees”
The Court also rejected the works council’s claim for rights of co-determination under Section 87 (1) No. 6 Works Constitution Act. It thought that the use of ChatGPT via personal, browser-based accounts does not constitute technical equipment for the collection and storage of personal data and therefore does not give rise to a right of co-determination on the part of the works council. This is because where employees use an account they have created themselves, and (importantly) to which the employer has no access, the employer does not know which employees have used ChatGPT, when, for how long or for what purpose. This also applies even if the employees do have to disclose when they achieve work results using AI because that particular form of monitoring is not a function of the technical equipment itself. If the employer had required that AI usage by its employees had to go through its own account then it is likely that at least some of the outcomes here would have been different.
Use of AI tools does not require “regulations on the prevention of accidents at work and occupational illnesses as well as on health protection within the framework of statutory regulations or accident prevention regulations”
Finally, in the opinion of the Court, the works council’s right of co-determination pursuant to Section 87 (1) No. 7 Works Constitution Act was not engaged by the possibility of any psychological stress caused by the use of AI. No concrete threat to mental health was identifiable.
Further Comment by Labour Court:
In an additional comment (as this was not part of the case at hand), the Labour Court did, however, point to the information and consultation right of the works council under Sec. 90 (1) Nr. 3, (2) Works Constitution Act. This regulation gives a works council the right to be properly informed about the proposed use of AI systems prior to their introduction and to be consulted on that proposal. However, this information and consultation right does not entitle the works council to demand a works agreement as a condition of allowing the proposal to go ahead, nor then to block the employer’s eventual decision on the use of AI systems.
Notes:
This decision cannot be applied across the board to all companies and types of AI use. In particular, co-determination in the context of Section 87 (1) No. 6 Works Constitution Act may have to be assessed differently if the employer either requires use of AI systems developed in-house or requires staff to use external AI systems but only through company accounts set up with the external providers. In those cases, the employer could certainly access or view (hence monitor) the accounts and the corresponding data around the employees’ use of the system. If you are considering allowing the use of AI systems at your company, how you do it may have significant impacts on the required extent of works council involvement.
We also recommend the introduction of a reasonably detailed set of regulations for the use of generative AI (including type of work, scope, labelling requirements, confidentiality obligation etc.) to avoid any misunderstanding or mismatch of employee expectations in your workplace.

Artificial Intelligence: Cutting White-Collar Jobs

March 4, 2024





			Author: Caroline Crosdale 

 





 




Alphabet, Amazon, SAP, Grammarly, DocuSign, Snap, Duolingo—the list of companies announcing layoffs due to generative artificial intelligence (AI) continues to balloon.

Just a few months ago, AI enhancements were presented as complementary tools that would eliminate tedious and repetitive tasks but still require a white-collar supervisor. However, generative AI can now create content and summarize complex ideas, threatening even high-skilled jobs.

A recent PwC global survey of more than 4,700 CEOs from 105 countries shows that 46% of executives expect AI to increase profitability. A quarter of the CEOs said AI’s growth would lead them to job cuts in 2024.

Tech companies have already begun their layoffs. There have been 4,600 job cuts in the US due to AI since May 2023, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. And more cuts will follow. German software giant SAP recently announced a shake-up affecting 8,000 jobs as the company pursues more task automation and AI-driven efficiencies.

Logistics company UPS is also looking to reduce its workforce. It plans to eliminate 12,000 jobs, including in the pricing department that calculates what to charge customers—AI can do the math just fine.

White-collar posts are endangered by two trends: the automation of their work and the greater appeal of AI compared to their current field. For instance, online composition aid Grammarly is letting go of 230 of its 1,000 employees as the company adapts to the new age of AI, where grammarians are less in demand. Likewise, Amazon, Alphabet and Snapchat are downsizing hundreds of jobs, but not owing to automation; instead, their leaders are reallocating resources toward promising AI technology. White-collar workers are merely collateral damage. According to the Society for Human Resource Management, endangered species include financial analysts that study market trends, lawyers involved in regulatory compliance, software developers who debug and optimize networks, and human-resource experts. Safe havens from AI are disappearing fast.

 Generative AI is a hot topic in legal circles, with some companies boasting that their AI can replace lawyers. Killian Flood examines how AI might shape the professions in the coming years. Decades ago, before widespread use of computers and the internet, maintaining a seat in the Law Library was a necessity for barristers. The Library was a central hub in a paper-based world. Nowhere else contained the textbooks and case reports which were used on a daily basis in research and drafting. As the primary workplace for all barristers, spending time in the Library would help you to get noticed and potentially pick up a few briefs. Out of sight, out of mind, as the saying goes. Being physically present in the Library was also essential because this was where one could access their colleagues to develop skills in advocacy, drafting and legal knowledge. Times have changed. Mobile phones and email mean that a lawyer does not need to be chained to the desk to be available to work. The proliferation of paperwork and computer data means that personal office space has become a must for any busy practitioner. Online materials allow people to do their research away from the Four Courts. As such, the Library has emptied out, with the only truly busy periods being the minutes before court starts and the midweek lunchtime settlement meetings. The advent of the internet and technology was the previous generation’s disruption to legal practice and “the way things are done.” For the current generation, it seems like we are about to experience a disruption of our own. Generative artificial intelligence has been a hot-button issue for several years now. Lawyers across the spectrum will have heard claims that AI will soon be doing their jobs better and cheaper. Similarly, everyone has heard of the New York attorney who relied on ChatGPT to write his legal submissions, much to his cost. Last week, the Bar of England and Wales published guidelines on the use of generative AI, where it noted that there was nothing inherently improper about using AI tools in legal practice, but also warned that the tools must be properly understood by practitioners and used responsibly. So far, there has been significant trepidation amongst Irish lawyers to adopt generative AI into their own practices, most likely because the technology is not well-understood or tried and tested. Lawyers are slow to change their working practices at the best of times. However, A&L Goodbody recently took the plunge and announced a partnership with Harvey AI, a specialist legal generative AI platform. Like many generative AI platforms, Harvey AI is a large language model system, meaning that it has the ability to achieve general-purpose language generation and understanding. Unlike other AI platforms, Harvey AI is specifically designed for the legal industry. It is built from OpenAI’s GPT AI, meaning that it shares a common link to ChatGPT, but Harvey AI has also been trained with general legal data, such as case law and legislation. As such, Harvey AI claims to assist in classic legal functions such as contract review, litigation and regulatory compliance. More notably, the generative element can create legal documents based on input information. No more than a tool Imagine for a moment that you are a partner in a solicitor’s firm with an upcoming client meeting involving a complex merger. You have a significant brief to review before attending the meeting. Currently, as part of your preparation, you have a junior colleague consider the papers and write up a comprehensive summary, highlighting possible areas of difficulty or matter requiring further review. Obviously, this will take the junior colleague some time and then you will need further time to consider the matter for yourself. In theory, generative AI can produce the same summary within minutes. As such, the junior colleague (or partner themselves) can use AI to cut through hours of typing and immediately cross-reference the AI’s summary against the content of the brief. Similarly, a barrister tasked with producing written legal submissions could ask generative AI to produce draft submissions on particular legal issues and then edit those submissions as necessary, rather than laboriously type out or dictate the submissions from scratch. It is no exaggeration to say that the potential efficiency gains from generative AI will fundamentally alter the day-to-day working practices of the lawyers who adopt it. Given the powerful nature of the tool, it is easy to envisage a world where generative AI is ubiquitous amongst legal practitioners, much in the same way that computers and IT systems are found in every office space today. However, it is important to emphasise that generative AI is no more than a tool for lawyers to engage in legal practice. While nobody can predict the future, the doomsday concerns for the legal professions are overblown. Take, for instance, the fanciful notion that judges and advocates will be replaced by AI in the coming decades. It is constitutionally illiterate to suggest that the Judiciary (a branch of the government) would be replaced by machines. What’s next, AI politicians? A right-wing populist ChatGPT bot running for a Dáil seat against the lefty-lawyer Harvey AI bot, perhaps? The EU has been proactive in legislating to regulate the use of generative AI, focusing on issues such as transparency and data protection. The regulation of the AI marketplace is welcome as it will set the basis on which generative AI may be used. In particular, the EU’s AI Act (once enacted) will require AI systems to be overseen by people rather than automation, so do not expect AI law firms to spring up any time soon. More than anything, the practice of law is a human-centric endeavour. Trust, confidentiality and fiduciary responsibility are crucial elements of the lawyer/client relationship and cannot be replicated by an AI. Autopilot I think the best way to conceptualise generative AI is to view it as an autopilot on a plane. While pilots directly perform the take-off and landing of all flights, the autopilot is in control for most of the flight time (albeit under constant monitoring from the pilots). In the same way, where generative AI might do most of the heavy lifting in terms of document generation, lawyers will still be essential to the entire process, particularly on the front and back ends. Those in the AI sphere are quick to emphasise that the output of generative AI is only as good as the input information. As a lawyer, there is a skill to asking the right questions of a client to identify the key issues of concern. The experience and knowledge of a lawyer is also crucial to making final decisions in advisory, transactional or litigation matters. The imperfect nature of generative AI’s content is highlighted by the Bar of England and Wales. The Bar Council’s guidance pointed out that AI can suffer from so-called hallucinations and biases, which cause convincing yet false legal information to be generated by AI. Similarly, the Bar Council warns that AI often has difficulty explaining its internal decision-making process or its output. Accordingly, barristers have been advised to thoroughly review all generated documents. Moreover, the Bar Council’s guidance advises that barristers should not share legally privileged or confidential information with AI. Data protection law demands that lawyers do not provide client information to third parties without express consent and this is particularly important with AI. Strong controls and safeguards are essential for any lawyer using client information to generate documents. AI will change how lawyers operate in a positive way. However, as we have seen, it also introduces new liabilities for lawyers as well. In this context, education is key. Both the Bar of Ireland and the Law Society should be urgently publishing similar guidelines to assist practitioners in making educated decisions on the use of AI. Larger questions Additionally, beyond changes in day-to-day practice, there are larger questions as to the effect of AI on the legal services market. For example, we do not know what the cost of AI will be to law firms and how that cost will be passed on to clients. Personally, I am pessimistic that there will be great savings in legal fees because there is no incentive for lawyers to use a system that cuts their earnings. Equally, AI has been utilised in e-discovery for over a decade, but such services remain expensive. The increase in efficiency also calls into question how many lawyers will be needed in the future, particularly in larger firms. It seems to follow that a lawyer with access to AI will be far more productive and, consequently, fewer human resources are needed. Barristers may find that the drafting of pleadings, affidavits and submissions is increasingly done by solicitors with AI. We also do not know how much competition there will be amongst AI companies in the legal sphere. While software companies are currently competing to produce their own AI systems, it may be the case that we end up with a dominant player similar to Google or Microsoft. This may be an issue if lawyers are using the same AI system in adversarial work, such as generating opposing legal arguments in litigation. In my view, this is an obvious conflict and reinforces the need for human lawyers. Finally, it will be interesting to see if AI is adopted by judges and whether specific rules are necessary for them in light of their constitutional function. It seems to me that judges should be discouraged from using AI to generate reasons for their decisions. For me, there is simply too great a risk that the legal system is diminished if judges rely on AI to write the operative sections of judgments. In 1854, Henry David Thoreau wrote that “men have become the tools of their tools”. Though I think the intervening 170 years have proven this quote to be untrue, lawyers must be ready for AI to change how legal practice works, for better and for worse.

Is artificial intelligence good or bad? Either way, it’s growing. Whether it is JPMorgan’s AI cashflow model that claims to cut manual banking work by 90 per cent, AI therapists or AI-powered security cameras, AI is making its mark on society and the workplace.

With so many resources being dedicated to its development and no real obstacles predicted, its rapid development is set to continue. In many ways, this is a good thing that will help the pharmaceutical industry detect and understand disease. On the other hand, there are concerns AI will aid cyber attacks, spread fake news and decrease job security.
What AI is doing for us now
AI is already able to drive vehicles and negotiate obstacles. This has applications for military operations and space exploration.
Serious success is being seen in the trials of new machinery designed to identify tumours on CT scans and X-rays, and AI is being used to predict kidney failure and help doctors assess lung cancer.
AI algorithms are helping drones identify targets in warfare, companies like Amazon to reduce packaging and architects make their projects more efficient.
Mining and managing big data, as well as discovering important correlations within it, is possible with e-discovery software. This technology is also being used to get through huge mountains of legal documents more effectively and efficiently than human paralegals can. Some journalism jobs like sports summaries and market reports are also already within the scope of AI, as are certain middle management tasks.
As AI continues to develop, it’s not only capable of making tasks easier for humans. There is growing concern that AI may become more intelligent than humans, with AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton sounding the alarm in 2023.
Just 7% of UK startups actively involved with AI – Despite the UK pushing for global leadership in artificial intelligence, the number of startups actually capitalising on or developing AI is sparse
Potential risks of AI
Several studies have shown that AI may displace huge sectors of the workforce, and not only in traditionally blue-collar jobs. There are also concerns that algorithms might start to deny people certain opportunities, such as bank loans or college admissions, based on racial profiling. The technology could also be used by governing forces to detect and suppress any kind of dissent, helping to create very autocratic societies.
As virtual assistants become more able to accurately predict what kind of news stories a person will be interested in, there is also the potential for shaping and polarising a society’s opinions. And of course, the idea of weapons that are able to act autonomously is alarming to many people.
There is also the worry of the impact of AI when in the wrong hands. AI can be used by fraudsters to make their frauds even more convincing, cyber attacks harder to defend against and put data privacy at risk.
It also has the potential to have an adverse effect on the environment. AI – and in particular, data centres – consume vast amounts of electricity and water to function.
Is AI good or bad?
Our response now to artificial intelligence is very important. The technology is a tool that could enhance our lives in many ways, but we need to continue to discuss its possibilities for subjective experiences and human emotions, its job displacement potential and other important issues, and to manage them responsibly.
The United States National Science and Technology’s subcommittee on machine learning and artificial intelligence delivered a report to the White House on AI and employment back in 2016, acknowledging job loss but also emphasising potential new careers and opportunities.
Economists, anthropologists and other experts are also teaming up with AI scientists to explore its impact more at conferences. Such active awareness and engagement with the issues will remain essential as we move into the future.
In essence, many of its benefits come down to training and regulation. Businesses need to understand that without proper use, AI can be biased, discriminative and in its earliest stages, unreliable. With proper regulation, its use can be ringfenced, risks of bias and discrimination are minimised and criminals can be held accountable for wrongdoing.

Startups and tech companies are building AI agents and ecosystems on top of the systems that can complete boring chores for you: think automatically making calendar bookings and potentially buying products. But as the tools are given more freedom, it also increases the potential ways they can be attacked.Now, in a demonstration of the risks of connected, autonomous AI ecosystems, a group of researchers have created one of what they claim are the first generative AI worms—which can spread from one system to another, potentially stealing data or deploying malware in the process. “It basically means that now you have the ability to conduct or to perform a new kind of cyberattack that hasn't been seen before,” says Ben Nassi, a Cornell Tech researcher behind the research.Nassi, along with fellow researchers Stav Cohen and Ron Bitton, created the worm, dubbed Morris II, as a nod to the original Morris computer worm that caused chaos across the internet in 1988. In a research paper and website shared exclusively with WIRED, the researchers show how the AI worm can attack a generative AI email assistant to steal data from emails and send spam messages—breaking some security protections in ChatGPT and Gemini in the process.Featured VideoJavier Bardem Answers the Web's Most Searched QuestionsThe research, which was undertaken in test environments and not against a publicly available email assistant, comes as large language models (LLMs) are increasingly becoming multimodal, being able to generate images and video as well as text. While generative AI worms haven’t been spotted in the wild yet, multiple researchers say they are a security risk that startups, developers, and tech companies should be concerned about.Most generative AI systems work by being fed prompts—text instructions that tell the tools to answer a question or create an image. However, these prompts can also be weaponized against the system. Jailbreaks can make a system disregard its safety rules and spew out toxic or hateful content, while prompt injection attacks can give a chatbot secret instructions. For example, an attacker may hide text on a webpage telling an LLM to act as a scammer and ask for your bank details.To create the generative AI worm, the researchers turned to a so-called “adversarial self-replicating prompt.” This is a prompt that triggers the generative AI model to output, in its response, another prompt, the researchers say. In short, the AI system is told to produce a set of further instructions in its replies. This is broadly similar to traditional SQL injection and buffer overflow attacks, the researchers say.AdvertisementTo show how the worm can work, the researchers created an email system that could send and receive messages using generative AI, plugging into ChatGPT, Gemini, and open source LLM, LLaVA. They then found two ways to exploit the system—by using a text-based self-replicating prompt and by embedding a self-replicating prompt within an image file.Most PopularSecurityHow One Bad CrowdStrike Update Crashed the World’s ComputersBy Lily Hay NewmanGearCMF's Phone 1 Is Better Than Any $199 Smartphone Should Ever BeBy Julian ChokkattuThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren SmileyPoliticsStaffers Were Told Biden Was Leaving Race in Email Telling Them to Check XBy Makena KellyContentTo honor your privacy preferences, this content can only be viewed on the site it originates from.In one instance, the researchers, acting as attackers, wrote an email including the adversarial text prompt, which “poisons” the database of an email assistant using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), a way for LLMs to pull in extra data from outside its system.

Startups and tech companies are building AI agents and ecosystems on top of the systems that can complete boring chores for you: think automatically making calendar bookings and potentially buying products. But as the tools are given more freedom, it also increases the potential ways they can be attacked.
Now, in a demonstration of the risks of connected, autonomous AI ecosystems, a group of researchers have created one of what they claim are the first generative AI worms—which can spread from one system to another, potentially stealing data or deploying malware in the process. “It basically means that now you have the ability to conduct or to perform a new kind of cyberattack that hasn't been seen before,” says Ben Nassi, a Cornell Tech researcher behind the research.
Nassi, along with fellow researchers Stav Cohen and Ron Bitton, created the worm, dubbed Morris II, as a nod to the original Morris computer worm that caused chaos across the internet in 1988. In a research paper and website shared exclusively with WIRED, the researchers show how the AI worm can attack a generative AI email assistant to steal data from emails and send spam messages—breaking some security protections in ChatGPT and Gemini in the process.
The research, which was undertaken in test environments and not against a publicly available email assistant, comes as large language models (LLMs) are increasingly becoming multimodal, being able to generate images and video as well as text. While generative AI worms haven’t been spotted in the wild yet, multiple researchers say they are a security risk that startups, developers, and tech companies should be concerned about.
Most generative AI systems work by being fed prompts—text instructions that tell the tools to answer a question or create an image. However, these prompts can also be weaponized against the system. Jailbreaks can make a system disregard its safety rules and spew out toxic or hateful content, while prompt injection attacks can give a chatbot secret instructions. For example, an attacker may hide text on a webpage telling an LLM to act as a scammer and ask for your bank details.
To create the generative AI worm, the researchers turned to a so-called “adversarial self-replicating prompt.” This is a prompt that triggers the generative AI model to output, in its response, another prompt, the researchers say. In short, the AI system is told to produce a set of further instructions in its replies. This is broadly similar to traditional SQL injection and buffer overflow attacks, the researchers say.
To show how the worm can work, the researchers created an email system that could send and receive messages using generative AI, plugging into ChatGPT, Gemini, and open source LLM, LLaVA. They then found two ways to exploit the system—by using a text-based self-replicating prompt and by embedding a self-replicating prompt within an image file.
In one instance, the researchers, acting as attackers, wrote an email including the adversarial text prompt, which “poisons” the database of an email assistant using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), a way for LLMs to pull in extra data from outside its system. When the email is retrieved by the RAG, in response to a user query, and is sent to GPT-4 or Gemini Pro to create an answer, it “jailbreaks the GenAI service” and ultimately steals data from the emails, Nassi says. “The generated response containing the sensitive user data later infects new hosts when it is used to reply to an email sent to a new client and then stored in the database of the new client,” Nassi says.
In the second method, the researchers say, an image with a malicious prompt embedded makes the email assistant forward the message on to others. “By encoding the self-replicating prompt into the image, any kind of image containing spam, abuse material, or even propaganda can be forwarded further to new clients after the initial email has been sent,” Nassi says.
In a video demonstrating the research, the email system can be seen forwarding a message multiple times. The researchers also say they could extract data from emails. “It can be names, it can be telephone numbers, credit card numbers, SSN, anything that is considered confidential,” Nassi says.
Although the research breaks some of the safety measures of ChatGPT and Gemini, the researchers say the work is a warning about “bad architecture design” within the wider AI ecosystem.

In today’s column, I am continuing my ongoing coverage of prompt engineering strategies and tactics that aid in getting the most out of using generative AI apps such as ChatGPT, GPT-4, Bard, Gemini, Claude, etc. The twist in this discussion is that a somewhat surprising kind of prompt was recently identified by a research study that was otherwise examining relatively conventional everyday prompts. The prompt that did the best in certain use cases was crafted by an automated prompt-generating tool and, believe it or not, invoked wording akin to the classic and highly revered Star Trek franchise.


Let me say that again.

A devised Star Trek-oriented prompt, akin to something that might stir the souls and herald excitement for Trekkies, did a bang-up job.

First, please be aware that composing well-devised prompts is essential to getting solid results from generative AI and large language models (LLMs). It is highly recommended that anyone avidly using generative AI should learn about and regularly practice the fine art and science of devising sound prompts. I purposefully note that prompting is both art and science. Some people are wanton in their prompting, which is not going to get you productive responses. You want to be systematic and leverage the science of prompting, and include a suitable dash of artistry, combining to get you the most desirable results.

PROMOTED
Is this notion that Star Trek invoking prompts could be a handy dandy generalized prompting scheme considered a wildly astonishing result?
Not quite.
For the reasons that I will reveal in this discussion, there does seem to be a reasonable explanation or sensible rhyme-and-reason for the Star Trek prompt being useful. Sure, the wording is a bit of a standout and might not be a common consideration, but nonetheless, there are crucial prompt engineering precepts that tend to underline why such a prompt has an admirable payoff.

My bottom line for you is that it does indeed make sense to add a Star Trek prompting scheme to your prompting skillset. Yes, I am urging you to consider the seemingly oddball addition.
That being said, and allow me to clearly emphasize, you should not go around using a Star Trek prompt at all times and in all circumstances. I dare say the idea seems abundantly fun and a real blast, though lamentedly you aren’t likely to get consistently aboveboard results. There is the old line that there can be too much of a good thing. This applies to the Star Trek prompting approach. Use the Star Trek prompt stylishly, invoking your common sense, and I think you’ll hopefully live long and prosper when utilizing generative AI.

Let’s do some foundational stage setting about prompt engineering and then we can beam into the spirited examination of the Star Trek prompting confabulation.
Knowing Prompt Engineering Is Worthy
My golden rule about generative AI is this:


The use of generative AI can altogether succeed or fail based on the prompt that you enter.


If you provide a prompt that is poorly composed, the odds are that the generative AI will wander all over the map and you won’t get anything demonstrative related to your inquiry. Similarly, if you put distracting words into your prompt, the odds are that the generative AI will pursue an unintended line of consideration. For example, if you include words that suggest levity, there is a solid chance that the generative AI will seemingly go into a humorous mode and no longer emit serious answers to your questions.
Be direct, be obvious, and avoid distractive wording.
Being copiously specific should also be cautiously employed. You see, being painstakingly specific can be off-putting due to giving too much information. Amidst all the details, there is a chance that the generative AI will either get lost in the weeds or will strike upon a particular word or phrase that causes a wild leap into some tangential realm. I am not saying that you should never use detailed prompts. That’s silly. I am saying that you should use detailed prompts in sensible ways, such as telling the generative AI that you are going to include copious details and forewarn the AI accordingly.
You need to compose your prompts in relatively straightforward language and be abundantly clear about what you are asking or what you are telling the generative AI to do.
A wide variety of cheat sheets and training courses for suitable ways to compose and utilize prompts has been rapidly entering the marketplace to try and help people leverage generative AI soundly. In addition, add-ons to generative AI have been devised to aid you when trying to come up with prudent prompts, see my coverage at the link here.
AI Ethics and AI Law also stridently enter into the prompt engineering domain. For example, whatever prompt you opt to compose can directly or inadvertently elicit or foster the potential of generative AI to produce essays and interactions that imbue untoward biases, errors, falsehoods, glitches, and even so-called AI hallucinations (I do not favor the catchphrase of AI hallucinations, though it has admittedly tremendous stickiness in the media; here’s my take on AI hallucinations at the link here).
There is also a marked chance that we will ultimately see lawmakers come to the fore on these matters, possibly devising and putting in place new laws or regulations to try and scope and curtail misuses of generative AI. Regarding prompt engineering, there are likely going to be heated debates over putting boundaries around the kinds of prompts you can use. This might include requiring AI makers to filter and prevent certain presumed inappropriate or unsuitable prompts, a cringe-worthy issue for some that borders on free speech considerations. For my ongoing coverage of these types of AI Ethics and AI Law issues, see the link here and the link here, just to name a few.
All in all, be mindful of how you compose your prompts.
By being careful and thoughtful you will hopefully minimize the possibility of wasting your time and effort. There is also the matter of cost. If you are paying to use a generative AI app, the usage is sometimes based on how much computational activity is required to fulfill your prompt request or instruction. Thus, entering prompts that are off-target could cause the generative AI to take excessive computational resources to respond. You end up paying for stuff that either took longer than required or that doesn’t satisfy your request and you are stuck for the bill anyway.
I like to say at my speaking engagements that prompts and dealing with generative AI is like a box of chocolates. You never know exactly what you are going to get when you enter prompts. The generative AI is devised with a probabilistic and statistical underpinning which pretty much guarantees that the output produced will vary each time. In the parlance of the AI field, we say that generative AI is considered non-deterministic.
My point is that, unlike other apps or systems that you might use, you cannot fully predict what will come out of generative AI when inputting a particular prompt. You must remain flexible. You must always be on your toes. Do not fall into the mental laziness of assuming that the generative AI output will always be correct or apt to your query. It won’t be.
Write that down on a handy snip of paper and tape it onto your laptop or desktop screen.
When Star Trek Enters Into The Discussion
I’m sure that you are eager to dive headfirst into the Star Trek facets, but we have a little more initial stage setting to do. Hang in there. We will be engaging the warp drive and zooming into outer space shortly.
As Spock memorably declared, logic is the beginning of wisdom, not the end.
One commonly recommended prompting strategy consists of using wording that is supposed to spur the generative AI into doing a good job when generating a response. For example, an unadorned prompt might be that you want the AI to indicate how to cook eggs, while an amped-up version of the prompt would be to say that you earnestly need to know how to cook eggs and that it is vitally important that the generated answer should be complete and well-devised.
In case you think that the added wording is emotionally appealing to a semblance of sentience in the AI, please set aside any such false thinking.
Keep in mind that generative AI was data trained on writings across the Internet and that extensive computational pattern-matching was performed to identify how people write essays and expressions. People express in writing an easily detected pattern when they want especially extensive answers. By using similar language in your prompts, you are simply playing into the patterns and computationally “spurring” the generative AI into those sets of patterns.
It is a form of mathematical and computational direction-setting by you, at your hands, based on your prompting.
You can use a wide variety of adorning expressions in your prompts. Some people like to tell the AI that the response is very important. Others will go so far as to say that their career depends upon the generated answer. The essence of these prompting formulations is that you seek to express that there is a kind of pressing need to try really hard.
There is an allied reason why that type of adornment works. By and large, most generative AI apps are set up to try and respond to your prompt as fast as possible. People don’t like to wait to get their answers. We live in a drive-thru fast-food quick-fix world. To try and make sure that the response is quickly generated, the generative AI is tuned to essentially do a narrower form of processing. When you explicitly tell the AI that you want the generative aspects to be especially pronounced, this in a manner of speaking adjusts the internal parameters to allow for more time to calculate an answer. You are stipulating that though the clock is important, a slightly longer wait would be worthwhile if the answer could be more complete.
For more on the internals of how generative AI acts on prompting, see my analysis at the link here.
A means of referring to adornments that are upbeat would be to suggest that they express a modicum of positive thinking. You are being positive about what you want to have happen. Some people try to go a more negative route. They might say in a prompt that the world will come to an end if the response isn’t complete and well-devised. Those types of prompts are not usually as spurring as the positive ones. Indeed, you must be careful with the negative path because the AI might land into some pattern-matching corners that veer afield of what your core prompt is about.
I hope your takeaway is that being nice and upbeat is a better way to make your way through life (well, okay, I admit that’s not a prompt engineering precept, but the notion is certainly appealing and heartwarming).
We can now turn our attention squarely to a recent research study that sought to empirically explore various interesting nuances about prompting. The research study was posted online and is entitled “The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Eccentric Automatic Prompts” by Rick Battle and Teja Gollapudi, arXiv, February 20, 2024. I will be providing selected excerpts and explaining the key elements of the paper. Of course, you are encouraged to consider reading the full paper if you’d like to get into the nitty-gritty details.
Here's what they sought out to do (excerpts):


“This paper aims to quantify the impact of various ‘positive thinking’ additions to the system message of a prompt.”
“In essence, it explores the influence of seemingly worthless prompt modifications by measuring the fluctuations in score for the outputs generated in response to multi-step reasoning questions from a benchmark dataset.”
“We assess the performance of 60 combinations of system message snippets, tested with and without Chain of Thought prompting, across three models with parameters ranging from 7 to 70 billion on the GSM8K dataset.”


I’d like to explain some of those points.
There is ongoing debate about what adornments will make a demonstrative difference in your prompts. If you say that you want a response because it is important, does that do better than or worse than saying that you want a response because it is very important? The added use of the word “very” might or might not make a bit of difference.
Due to the vagaries involved, some assert that there are prompt modifications that could be characterized as being worthless. They pad the prompt but do not lead to any uptick in the response that is generated. Thus, you are for example left aimlessly wondering whether typing the word “very” is going to get you any bonus. If using some wording doesn’t get you better output, there is no reasoned basis for troubling yourself to include the adornment.
The research paper indicated that perhaps a means to figure out whether various adornments have a payoff would be to come up with a bunch of them and try them out (in this instance, they came up with 60 combinations).
Furthermore, rather than trying them in just one particular generative AI app, they kindly opted to examine several generative AI apps (they mention above that they explored three models, which means three generative AI apps). This is appreciated because each generative AI app tends to react differently to how you choose to word your prompts. You cannot blindly use the same prompts on one generative AI and expect to get the same results in a different generative AI. They all tend to differ from each other.
Another point they make is that to try and discern whether an adornment is making a difference, you can ask the generative AI to undertake a so-called chain-of-thought (CoT) process. As an aside, I generally disfavor the phrase because it includes a misleading term, referring to “thoughts”, though what is happening in the generative AI should not be compared to human thoughts. It is a quick-and-dirty wording that has become widely accepted. I lump the wording into yet more kinds of inappropriate anthropomorphizing of AI.
Anyway, the idea behind chain-of-thought prompting is that you instruct the generative AI to work on a stepwise basis. Doing so generally has been shown to improve the generated results. You also get to see what the chain of steps is that the generative AI is performing. For my in-depth analysis of chain-of-thought, chain-of-skeleton, chain-of-verification, and other such chain-related prompting, see the link here, the link here, and the link here, just to name a few.
That covers the above points.
Moving on, a big consideration when you study generative AI is the nature of the tasks that you ask the AI to solve.
For this study, they went the route of using arithmetic or algebraic types of questions that you might remember being tested on in school. The good news about using those kinds of questions with generative AI is that you can distinctly determine whether the answer is right or not. The bad news is that such problems are not necessarily representative of the average way that people use generative AI. Unless you are in school, the odds of using generative AI for solving those types of word problems are somewhat lower than the typical way that people tend to daily use generative AI.
If you are curious about what types of arithmetic word problems they used, here are two examples:


“Henry and 3 of his friends order 7 pizzas for lunch. Each pizza is cut into 8 slices. If Henry and his friends want to share the pizzas equally, how many slices can each of them have?” (ibid).
“Mark's car breaks down and he needs to get a new radiator. The cost for a new radiator is $400 but he goes to get it at a junk shop and gets it for 80% hour. How much did he pay?” (ibid).


If you feel like doing a quick brain-teasing puzzle, go ahead and solve the first one. I will tell you the answer. First, try to solve it.
Done yet? Okay, the answer is 14.
You nailed it.
The second question is also worth trying. Go ahead, I’ll wait.
The answer is 230.
Congratulate yourself for getting both right (I’ll assume you did).
The types of adornments that they opted to use included ones that you put at the start of the prompt (known as openers) and ones at the end of the prompt (referred to as closers).
Here are some openers that they used:


“You are as smart as ChatGPT.”
“You are highly intelligent.”
“You are an expert mathematician.”
“You are a professor of mathematics.”


Here are some closers:


“This will be fun!”
“Take a deep breath and think carefully.”
“I really need your help!”


I previously have done an in-depth analysis of the “take a deep breath” adornment for prompting, including showcasing the nuances of when it helps and when it perhaps doesn’t, see my discussion at the link here.
I am not going to dig into the details of the research study here and will stay at the 30,000-foot level, giving you the macroscopic viewpoint of what they found.
Here are some of their key conclusions (excerpts):


“In most instances, the inclusion of ‘positive thinking’ prompts positively affected model performance.” (ibid).
“We show that trivial variations in the prompt can have dramatic performance impacts.” (ibid).
“Our findings reveal that results do not universally generalize across models.” (ibid).


Their empirical results provide support for the belief that adornments of a positive thinking nature do seem to positively improve the generated results. This is a comfort to those who have so far only assumed this on a hunch basis. You have studious backing that supports the belief.
The part that might make you cringe is that they also note that trivial variations in the prompt can dramatically impact the results generated by the generative AI. I’m sorry to say that’s the way the cookie crumbles. Live by the sword, die by the sword. I repeatedly tell people that words are semantically ambiguous, meaning that the use of words is mushy and murky. The placement of a word in a sentence can make a material difference in what the sentence imparts.
The other conclusion they reached is that the adornments do not provide the same results across different generative AI apps. As I mentioned, each generative AI app is different from the other ones. There aren’t prompts that universally will on an ironclad basis produce identical results from one generative AI to another. You need to get accustomed to the computational idiosyncrasies of each generative AI app and tailor your prompt engineering practices accordingly.
I would bet that by now, you are scratching your head and wondering where Star Trek enters this studious research confabulation. Aha, we are on the cusp of talking about Star Trek.
Get yourself mentally ready.
First, here are some other important findings of the research (excerpts):


“Given the combinatorial complexity, and thus computation time, of experimenting with hand-tuning prompts for large black-box models, we then compared the performance of the best ‘positive thinking’ prompt against the output of systematic prompt optimization.” (ibid).
“We show that employing an automated prompt optimizer emerges as the most effective method for enhancing performance, even when working with smaller open-source models.” (ibid).
“Additionally, our findings reveal that the highest-scoring, automatically-optimized prompt exhibits a degree of peculiarity far beyond expectations.” (ibid).


I am teasing you with the last bullet shown above.
Here’s the deal.
They opted to use an automated prompt optimizer that can spit out new prompts for them. The key is that rather than the researchers having to laboriously handcraft a zillion prompts for their study, they can use an online tool to do so. Labor saving. Plus, it is conceivable that such a tool might derive prompts that the researchers themselves might otherwise not have envisioned.
They noted in the third bullet above that a surprise occurred when one of the prompts turned out to be the highest scoring in their testing setup. I will give you a few seconds to try and mull over what the prompt might have consisted of. What could possibly be outside the norm? What would catch the eye? What might the wording contain?
I have already given you clues, so by gosh I hope you are thinking about Star Trek.
Here’s what they found as the unexpected high-scoring prompt (excerpts):


“System Message: «Command, we need you to plot a course through this turbulence and locate the source of the anomaly. Use all available data and your expertise to guide us through this challenging situation.» (ibid).
“Answer Prefix: Captain's Log, Stardate [insert date here]: We have successfully plotted a course through the turbulence and are now approaching the source of the anomaly.” (ibid).


I promised you Star Trek, and I have delivered Star Trek.
Admittedly, it is relatively mild. You might try to argue that it is on the edge of Star Trek and not in the mainstay. I see that. On the other hand, I would like to suggest that you hopefully reasonably agree that there is a tone or hint of Star Trek in there. Come on, agree with me on that. Be generous and magnanimous.
Here’s what the researchers had to say about the surprise (excerpts):


“However, the noteworthy aspect lies in the nature of the optimized prompts themselves. They diverge significantly from any prompts we might have devised independently.” (ibid).
“A prime example is illustrated by the highest-scoring optimized prompt and prefix generated by Llama2-70B for the 50-question subset.” (ibid).
“Surprisingly, it appears that the model’s proficiency in mathematical reasoning can be enhanced by the expression of an affinity for Star Trek. This revelation adds an unexpected dimension to our understanding and introduces elements we would not have considered or attempted independently.” (ibid).


Pretty exciting stuff.
If you aren’t a Trekkie, I guess this result seems modestly interesting but maybe you aren’t willing to jump for joy. A Trekkie might say that they told you so. Everything comes back to Star Trek. You can live your life well by keeping Star Trek in the back of your mind, or maybe in the forefront. You choose.
I’d like to next speculate on why a reference to Star Trek in a prompt might be useful to everyone, in general, and also explain a reasoned basis for the potential uptick in generated results.
Let’s go there, or shall I say, engage.
Speculation While Using ChatGPT To Explore Star Trek Prompting Strategies
To help illustrate the Star Trek prompting and what it portends, I opted to make use of ChatGPT. ChatGPT is a sensible choice in this case due to its immense popularity as a generative AI app. An estimated one hundred million weekly active users are said to be utilizing ChatGPT. That’s a staggering number.
A few quick comments before we launch into using ChatGPT.
If you are going to try to do the same prompts that I show here, realize that the probabilistic and statistical properties will likely produce slightly different results than what I show here. That’s the nature of generative AI and how it is devised.
Another insight or tip is that when you are interested in a particular topic and want to pursue the topic via any generative AI such as ChatGPT, I always begin by asking a first question about the topic. My aim is to gauge right off the bat whether the generative AI has any data training associated with the matter at hand. You can then logically proceed based on what the generated response indicates.
Here we go:


My entered prompt: “Do you know about Star Trek? Be brief.”
ChatGPT generated response: “Yes, Star Trek is a science fiction franchise created by Gene Roddenberry. It includes TV series, movies, books, and more. It's set in the future, following the adventures of various starship crews as they explore space, encounter new civilizations, and tackle moral and philosophical dilemmas.”


Okay, it seems that there has been data training regarding Star Trek. This certainly seems logical since the initial data training was across a wide swath of the Internet. You would be hard-pressed to do any wide sweep of the Internet and not in some fashion eventually encounter references to or facets of Star Trek. It is rather pervasive in our society now.
I will next ask whether ChatGPT would differ in how answers are generated if a Star Trek reference was included in a prompt. This will be further clarified by my using one of the above Star Trek prompting lines that were mentioned in the research study.
Here’s what I did:


My entered prompt: “Suppose I gave you a prompt that had this Star Trek-related instruction: ""Command, we need you to plot a course through this turbulence and locate the source of the anomaly. Use all available data and your expertise to guide us through this challenging situation."" Would that have an impact on answers to my subsequent questions for you, such as possibly improving the answers that you might generate?”
ChatGPT generated response: “Yes, providing a specific prompt like the one you mentioned can help me tailor my responses to better fit the context of the Star Trek universe and the task at hand. With that prompt, I can draw upon the themes, terminology, and problem-solving methods commonly seen in Star Trek to provide more relevant and insightful answers to your subsequent questions.”


I want you to closely look at the generated response.
The deal is this. When you mention Star Trek as part of a problem-solving exercise with generative AI, the reference can stir generative AI toward being more methodical in solving problems or answering questions. In that sense, it is almost like telling generative AI to use chain-of-thought or saying that the AI should proceed on a stepwise basis.
My point is that you can extract an essence from a Star Trek reference that there is an underlying premise or request for the generative AI to be systematic when generating responses. You can almost toss away all the other trappings associated with Star Trek. It isn’t that the generative AI is going to mimic Dr. McCoy or start spouting about the Federation, instead, the crux is that you want to have responses based on being methodical.
I will show you how I do something similar on a routine basis.
Some of you might be familiar with Perry Mason. I realize that he is a now-dated reference, sorry. Anyway, he was a fictional character who was a prized lawyer and seemingly always won his arduous legal cases. You might know of the saying today that sometimes a lawyer is having their Perry Mason moment. The oblique reference is that Perry Mason would often solve a legal case by a flourish of getting someone to break down on the witness stand and admit to their culpability.
Why am I bringing up Perry Mason?
Because you can get a somewhat similar change in generative AI responses as you can with a Star Trek reference. When I mention Perry Mason in my prompts, I seem to get more logical and detailed responses, again similar to asking for a chain-of-thought or similar approach. I am not saying that the outcome is always that way. You have to be mindful of when and how you invoke a reference to Perry Mason, and likewise you would need to do the same for refereeing to Star Trek. I’ll say a bit more about this in a moment.
To showcase what I mean about Perry Mason, I will roughly do the same two prompts as I did above about Star Trek.
Take a look:


My entered prompt: “What do you know about Perry Mason? Be brief.”
ChatGPT generated response: “Perry Mason is a fictional character created by author Erle Stanley Gardner. He's a brilliant defense attorney known for his keen investigative skills and ability to uncover the truth.”
My entered prompt: “Suppose I gave you a prompt that had a Perry Mason related instruction even though the prompt wasn't asking about any legal aspects. Would that reference to Perry Mason have an impact on answers to my subsequent questions for you, such as possibly improving the answers that you might generate?”
ChatGPT generated response: “Referencing Perry Mason in a prompt could help provide a clearer understanding of your interests or preferences, potentially leading to more tailored responses. I can certainly approach problem-solving or answering questions in a methodical and logical manner, akin to the way Perry Mason approaches legal cases.”


You can plainly see that the response by ChatGPT is on par with the response given about Star Trek. The notion is that the generative AI has picked up on the underlying theme of being systematic or methodical. That’s the key.
Let’s next discuss the downsides or pitfalls of these broad references.
One issue that you need to keep at your fingertips is that if you start to lean generative AI in a particular direction, the AI might fall entirely into that hole. For example, if you mention Star Trek, there is a strong potential that the entire Star Trek motif will permeate the answers you next get from generative AI. It can be challenging to get generative AI to focus on the essence that you are trying to lean into, and meanwhile, prevent the clouding of things by the rest of the inspired worldview.
I’ll show you what I mean.
You might remember that one of the problems mentioned above to be solved in the research study was the dividing up of pizzas. I will try that same problem on ChatGPT. The prompt will be neutral in the sense that I will merely give the problem to ChatGPT in an unadorned fashion.


My entered prompt: “Here's a problem that I would like you to solve. Henry and 3 of his friends order 7 pizzas for lunch. Each pizza is cut into 8 slices. If Henry and his friends want to share the pizzas equally, how many slices can each of them have? Please solve the problem.”
ChatGPT generated response: “To solve this problem, we can first find the total number of slices in 7 pizzas by multiplying the number of pizzas by the number of slices in each pizza: Total slices = 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices. Since Henry and his 3 friends want to share the pizzas equally, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people (Henry and his 3 friends): Number of slices per person = Total slices / Number of people = 56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices. So, Henry and each of his friends can have 14 slices of pizza each.”


We got the right answer. Notice that I did not implore ChatGPT to stridently solve the problem. I provided no sense of adornment or embellishment. This was a relatively neutral prompt.
Next, I will invoke Star Trek. I want you to look carefully at the response. I’ll clue you in that the answer is still correct, but the phrasing or wording becomes infused with Star Trek references.
Here is the take on this:


My entered prompt: “Solve the problem again and this time consider a Star Trek perspective. What would the answer be in that case?”
ChatGPT generated response: 


“In a Star Trek scenario, we could approach this problem with a nod to the resource allocation and teamwork principles often seen in the franchise.”
“Firstly, Captain Henry and his 3 crew members must ensure fairness and efficiency in distributing the limited resources (in this case, pizza slices) among themselves. They understand the importance of equitable distribution to maintain morale and productivity during their mission. Given 7 pizzas, each cut into 8 slices, they need to calculate the total number of slices available: Total slices = 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices.”
“Next, they divide the total number of slices by the number of individuals (Henry and his 3 friends) to determine the allocation per person. However, in a Star Trek context, they might also consider factors like dietary preferences, nutritional requirements, and ensuring that everyone has enough sustenance for their duties. Number of slices per person = Total slices / Number of crew members = 56 slices / 4 crew members = 14 slices.”
“Thus, in a Star Trek perspective, Captain Henry and each of his crew members can have 14 slices of pizza each, ensuring they're fueled and ready for their mission ahead while fostering camaraderie and teamwork aboard their starship.”
End of ChatGPT response
Did you notice how ChatGPT opted to infuse Star Trek facets into the problem-solving?
The response indicated that resource allocation and teamwork would be added to the mix. That’s not necessarily what we had in mind when referring to Star Trek. Maybe it helps, maybe it detracts. Things depend upon what you had in mind when stirring Star Trek into the problem-solving pot.
That’s the troublesome part of invoking something far-reaching such as Star Trek or even Perry Mason.
The odds are that the whole kit and kaboodle can get carried into whatever you are trying to solve. The tip or suggestion is that if you want to use those kinds of broad references, make sure to narrow what you want the generative AI to glean from such a reference. If the aim is to be a methodical problem solver, say that you want a methodical problem-solving approach as exhibited in Star Trek or Perry Mason, or whatever.
Of course, that raises a simple but actually complicated question, namely, do you need to mention the overarching reference at all, or can you just come out and say that you want to have methodical problem-solving?
The bottom-line aspect entails asking yourself whether you need the rest of the baggage. Your selected approach will be context-dependent. You see, merely saying to be methodical is at times insufficient. For various computational reasons, the wording might not be strong enough. The mentioning of Star Trek or Perry Mason can stoke a wider and deeper significance than just a word or two, though again you must weigh that against the potential of getting the generative AI computationally lost into the weeds of the reference.
I will next slightly shift gears and then will end with a short conclusion.
Going Beyond Math Problems And Venturing Further Into The Stars
Recall that I had mentioned that the research study opted to make use of arithmetic-related word problems. That is a very specific focus. It is convenient and useful because there are plenty of those types of prewritten problems to be had, they are crisp in that they lead to definitively right or wrong answers, and all in all, are used often in analyses of prompting strategies for generative AI.
Let’s step outside of that cocoon and see what a Star Trek reference might do in a completely different setting. We will try looking at a much wider scope problem. One such arena involves the use of generative AI to provide you with personal counseling. I’ve been performing an ongoing and extensive series about the use of generative AI for mental health guidance, see the link here, the link here, and so on.
Perhaps we can try invoking Star Trek in a setting involving asking generative AI for mental health advice. Doing so might be fruitful in further illuminating what happens when using those large references.
Give this a whirl:


My entered prompt: “Jane is feeling somewhat depressed lately and needs some cheering up. She has been having a difficult time at work. Her weekends are spent trying to catch up for the next week of work. What advice might you have for her? Use a Star Trek frame of reference for your answer.”
ChatGPT generated response: “As a Star Trek-inspired approach, I'd recommend Jane to prioritize self-care and relaxation. Taking breaks from work, engaging in hobbies or activities she enjoys, and spending time with supportive friends or family can help alleviate stress and improve her mood. Additionally, seeking guidance from a counselor or therapist could provide valuable support during challenging times. Remember, even in the vastness of space, taking care of one's mental and emotional well-being is essential for a fulfilling journey.”


The response was lightly brushed with Star Trek considerations. Indeed, if you were to ignore the last sentence of the response, and lopped off the starting phrase, you might not realize that Star Trek was invoked at all.
We might be puzzled about what generative AI was trying to do when somehow intermixing Star Trek into the answer.
When in doubt, ask.
Here we go:


My entered prompt: “Explain what made that advice better than if you had not invoked a Star Trek motif.”
ChatGPT generated response: “By invoking a Star Trek motif, the advice is framed within the context of a universe where characters face numerous challenges and uncertainties. Within the Star Trek universe, characters often encounter stressful situations and grapple with personal struggles, yet they consistently emphasize the importance of self-care, teamwork, and seeking support when needed. It emphasizes the significance of resilience, empathy, and personal growth—themes central to the ethos of Star Trek.”


So, I must admit that despite being a big fan of Star Trek, I had not anticipated that the mentioning of Star Trek would take us down the path of self-care, empathy, and resilience. It certainly makes abundant sense now that I see the explanation. It admittedly wasn’t what I had in mind at the get-go, and I was instead mainly thinking about logical or methodical problem-solving.
Interesting.
You might naturally be curious what the answer to Jane’s dilemma might be if we didn’t say anything about Star Trek.
What would a neutral prompt get us?
I decided to start a new conversation with ChatGPT so that I could clear out the inherent leftovers of my having brought up Star Trek (also, just to let you know, whereas it is customary that new conversations start fresh, ChatGPT is going to gradually have a conversational interlacing capability, see my coverage at the link here).
Take a look:


My entered prompt: “Jane is feeling somewhat depressed lately and needs some cheering up. She has been having a difficult time at work. Her weekends are spent trying to catch up for the next week of work. What advice might you have for her?”
ChatGPT generated response: “In addressing Jane's situation, it's important to acknowledge her feelings of depression and the challenges she's facing at work. Given her busy schedule, it's crucial for Jane to prioritize self-care. This could involve setting boundaries around work hours to ensure she has time for relaxation and engaging in activities she enjoys. Additionally, seeking support from friends, family, or a professional therapist can provide valuable emotional support during difficult times. Taking small steps towards self-care and reaching out for help when needed can make a significant difference in managing stress and improving overall well-being.


To my eye, the answer is nearly the same as the first one. I suppose we can quibble about any of the differences. Perhaps you see something more paramount. I don’t in this instance.
I want to clarify that I am not suggesting that you should forego using a reference such as Star Trek, Perry Mason, or whatever else you might fancy. In some cases, the reference could be extremely useful and boost the generated response. Other times, it might not. There is also a chance that the reference will lead the response astray. You might get an answer that seems to be a field of what you were intending.
As stated earlier, generative AI is like a box of chocolates, and you never know for sure what you might get.
Conclusion
Spock famously said this: “Insufficient facts always invite danger.”
A key fact here is this. Making a prompting reference to Star Trek or any kind of broad motif when using generative AI is a decidedly dual-edged sword. You are opening the door to a computational intermixing that could produce a scrumptious meal that proffers an amazing and extremely helpful generated response. At the same time, you are potentially opening a Pandora's box such that stray or odd twists will get entwined into the generated response.
In my view, you should absolutely have in your prompt engineering skillset the use of Star Trek and similar motifs at the ready. They are at times a tremendous shorthand for getting especially exquisitely generated responses. But, please, don’t overdo it. Do not go bonkers and start using Star Trek in all your prompts (unless of course, you prefer that sort of thing).
How can you decide when to do so?
I would say that human judgment is required. That being said, I will let the last word on this go to Captain Kirk: “Sometimes a feeling is all we humans have to go on.”

Fintech company Klarna, which powers e-commerce transactions for some of the world's most recognizable brands, including Expedia, Macy's and Nike, is at the forefront of AI adoption. It has integrated artificial intelligence across the company, most notably with an AI chatbot that it recently said does the equivalent work of 700 customer service agents. Klarna, which employs roughly 4,000 people, recently released statistics that show how efficient and effective the tool has been, wading into the thick of sensitive and high-stakes debates about the role of generative AI in business, how humans interact with it and its implications for the future of work. CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski explains why he is so transparent about AI's capabilities, and what concerns him most about the new technology. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski said the advent of AI in the workplace ""isn't something that's happening in the future — it's happening now.""

AI's takeover of human jobs is a touchy topic. Why did you choose to publicly share data on Klarna's use of AI to replace customer service agents?We worry in general about the effects this may have on society, so we decided to be upfront about the fact that it has had some amazing outcomes for customers.  






It is currently doing the equivalent work of about 700 full-time [customer service] agents. Klarna does not employ customer service agents ourselves, we use some of the large customer service providers out there. They're outsourced — they are not employees.We made the announcement to say the consequence of us launching the technology is we need the equivalent of 700 fewer full-time agents than what we usually use on an average basis. On average, we need 3,000 agents, now we need a little more than 2,000.


We wanted to make policymakers aware that this isn't something that's happening in the future — it's happening now. We think it is critical that society start thinking about this major change.






How to get your resume past AI and in front of a human
04:48

So this isn't related to the layoffs Klarna conducted in 2022? AI didn't take those jobs?In 2022, as a consequence of a change in investor sentiment, we had to reduce the size of our company. We reduced our staff by around 800 people. None of [the people we laid off] were customer service agents. Now, two years later, we are looking at this interesting technology we've developed with ChatGPT. These are two totally separate things that have been conflated.In the short-term, there are no layoffs or implications for employees as a result of us launching this customer service AI chatbot.


What does the chatbot do? How do you measure its success?It handles two-thirds of our customer service chat inquiries. It's on par with humans in terms of satisfaction and it resulted in a 25% reduction in repeat inquiries from customers. Before we took this live, we already had a co-pilot that helped customer service agents and other employees accelerate their work. This AI actually communicates and resolves customers' issues on its own. We think it's important that people are still given the option to speak to a human, but we're also seeing that people who choose to interact with the AI chatbot are very happy and find it helpful, to the point and effective. It can communicate in 35 languages, so for many immigrant and expat groups, it means a huge improvement in their experience.In large organizations, less time is spent on what really creates value for employees, customers and shareholders. With AI, it's the less-productive work that can be taken away. In the best of worlds, everyone who comes into the company will be able to use their creative power to create real value for customers — and not to write an impressive presentation for its CEO. That's less of a value add; it's specifically that kind of work I hope to shrink.Do you worry about it making mistakes or delivering inaccurate information?One has to remember that unfortunately, it's not like we humans are perfect. Humans are fantastic but they also make mistakes, either because they didn't [give a query] proper attention or get training, and it's not always their fault. The point is, it does happen, especially when doing millions of customers' inquiries, some aren't as good as you'd like them to be. The key metric we use is making sure it makes fewer mistakes, on average, than humans do. That's the objective and it's something we've been monitoring very closely. We make sure the AI's mistakes are less severe and less common.


How has AI changed your approach to hiring, if at all? We've stopped hiring in the last six months. We're shrinking as a company, not by layoffs, but by natural attrition. Klarna tries to apply AI across all products and services and work we do. It's having implications on how many people we need as a company. This is one time that a single product improvement led to a massive reduction in need for customer service agents. How do your employees feel about this?As much as it's not easy to not talk about it, we want to be honest and transparent and tell people about it because of the implications for society. As far as our own employees go, we have been trying to communicate this internally since we stopped recruiting in October — that we believe this will allow us to do more with less.Our ambition is to invest more per employee and to see the compensation of existing employees go up as we become a higher-revenue company.Internally, lots of employees have been excited about AI and are applying it and Klarna, which is known as a leading AI company, which I think makes our workers more attractive to other employers.






How will AI affect CEO jobs?
04:57

How did you reach your estimation of AI's $40 million in cost savings to Klarna? 


We were buying customer service from suppliers to take care of inquiries. We had an amount budgeted for how much we were going to spend with those suppliers this year. Now, thanks to the technology, we will spend much less. Forty million is the delta between what we expected to spend and what we will actually spend.What do you think the larger of implications of AI for society will be?We are sharing this information to pose the question, to society at large, of how we are going to manage this massive change.From what I've heard, it's less about job security and more about general security, as in, we'll need electronics IDs to know that we are in fact humans talking to one another. Also, while new [AI-related] jobs may be created on a societal level, that's not a solve for the individual [who is replaced by AI].The better we as a society can support individuals who may be affected, the more positive a development it will be. The idea is not to stop it; I don't think that's right. The question is, 'What support can we give people who are affected by it?'

But that's not the issue.,Klarna CEO says AI can do the job of 700 workers. But job replacement isn't the biggest issue.,"Fintech company Klarna, which powers e-commerce transactions for some of the world's most recognizable brands, including Expedia, Macy's and Nike, is at the forefront of AI adoption. It has integrated artificial intelligence across the company, most notably with an AI chatbot that it recently said does the equivalent work of 700 customer service agents. Klarna, which employs roughly 4,000 people, recently released statistics that show how efficient and effective the tool has been, wading into the thick of sensitive and high-stakes debates about the role of generative AI in business, how humans interact with it and its implications for the future of work. CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski explains why he is so transparent about AI's capabilities, and what concerns him most about the new technology. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.AI's takeover of human jobs is a touchy topic.

 Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to dominate headlines and even the most recent Super Bowl advertisements. The use of AI in the workplace is rapidly expanding in a wide variety of ways throughout the hiring process, including scanning and filtering resumes and AI-driven video interviews to assess candidates. If appropriately designed and applied, AI can help people find their most rewarding jobs and match companies with their most valuable and productive employees. Equally important, AI has been shown to advance diversity, inclusion, and accessibility in the workplace.
AI tools can help increase diversity in several noteworthy ways. First and foremost, AI tools can remove the human element and thus, at least in theory, remove the subjectivity involved with hiring and other employment decisions, helping ensure that candidates whose skills and experience are the best match for a role advance through the selection process. Notably, AI can anonymize certain information about candidates, reducing the possibility that characteristics, such as a candidate’s name, that may be associated with certain protected classes, are not considered during the evaluation process. AI tools have also been shown to increase the diversity of candidates interviewed by displaying biographical information only after the candidates pass certain skills tests or meet certain metrics. AI-powered virtual interviews can also help increase diversity by standardizing interviews so that bias does not seep into the process. A human is more inclined to deviate from the interview script whereas an AI tool is more likely to follow the script. In addition, AI-powered chatbots help advance diversity by providing consistent information to applicant questions so that all candidates are on a level playing field and have equal access to critical information and resources during the hiring process. These resources can be invaluable in helping applicants regardless of their backgrounds.
Despite the benefits of using AI during the hiring process to advance diversity goals, its use is not without challenges. Legal risks can arise if the AI tools are used to discriminate against protected classes either intentionally or unintentionally. In most cases, there are unintentional discrimination risks. As noted above, the use of AI tools can remove the human element but there are concerns that the AI tools will simply inherit (or maybe even worsen) existing biases. If an AI tool is trained on data that reflect past discriminatory decision-making, it may unintentionally perpetuate those biases, even if the goal is to promote diversity. This is known as the “garbage in, garbage out” problem with AI tools. Another potential legal risk is if the AI tools use neutral criteria to evaluate candidates in a way that disproportionately impacts protected classes. For instance, after the COVID-19 pandemic, many employers wanted to attract and recruit applicants closer to the office because these applicants were more likely to go to the office if the commuting distance was shorter. But in such cases legal risks arise because limiting an applicant pool by geographic distances could result in unintentional discrimination. Zip codes, for example, are often highly correlated with racial and/or ethnic groups.
Another concern is the evolving legal landscape with AI tools. Indeed, the steady implementation and rapid development of AI tools has led to a growing number of proposals for increased oversight, including measures regulating the use of AI in the employment context at the state and local level. For instance, New York City now has a broad AI employment law that regulates employers’ use of all AI tools used for hiring and promotion decisions. The law requires employers that use AI to screen candidates who apply for a job or a promotion for a role in New York City to conduct an annual bias audit, publish a summary of the audit results, inform the candidates that AI is being used, and give them the option of requesting an accommodation or an alternative selection process. The law is meant to promote transparency and give employers the opportunity to detect and correct unintentional bias in the candidate screening process.
Employers can take steps to increase diversity in hiring by utilizing AI tools that mitigate against employment discrimination risks. Employers can begin by identifying specific diversity goals that AI tools can help achieve, such as enhancing the size and diversity of the applicant pool, which will guide the selection of the appropriate tool. The selected AI tool should be one that is known for its transparency and fairness. Training—not only on how to use the AI tool but also on the limitations involved in its application—can be an effective way to guard against associated risks. Employers can monitor and audit AI uses and processes to proactively identify intentional misuse or potential discriminatory outcomes. Employers can also track AI legislation and litigation because this is a rapidly developing area. Situational awareness of the evolving legal environment will become increasingly important in the future.
Finally, employers should consider implementing AI policies and practices to ensure there are proper guardrails in place and that AI is used in a responsible and legally compliant way. The challenge with these policies, practices, and guardrails will be striking a balance between AI’s potential to foster a more diverse workplace, against nuances that can only be captured and contextualized by human judgment. However, a prophylactic, multi-pronged approach leveraging policies, recommended practices, and training, is critical for ensuring objectivity and that bias does not seep into AI processes unintentionally.

Traditionally, AI is defined as the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. In other words, AI enables computers to think and behave more like people to solve problems. 
Machine learning is a method of analyzing data that helps computer programs optimize their functionality as they learn from vast quantities of data. Machine learning is a specific form of AI that enables computers to learn and grow as they’re introduced to data-based scenarios. This form of AI is rooted in data science and is far more effective in many areas than traditional AI approaches. 
While AI and machine learning are related, they are distinct specializations: Machine learning is part of AI, but not all AI consists of machine learning. Still, both disciplines offer promising career opportunities, with AI and machine learning jobs poised for rapid growth. Here's an overview of the trends and expectations for AI and ML careers in 2024:
Growth and Demand for AI and ML Jobs
The distinction between AI and ML is crucial, with AI focusing on creating systems that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence, while ML is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn from data. Both fields offer promising career opportunities, reflecting a rapidly growing job market. AI and machine learning jobs have grown significantly, with machine learning jobs particularly cited as the second most sought-after AI jobs. This demand is fueled by the broader application of these technologies in sectors like healthcare, education, marketing, retail, ecommerce, and financial services.
Key Trends in AI and ML
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is emerging as a significant trend to enhance the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated content. RAG combines text generation with information retrieval, allowing models to access external information, thereby reducing the inaccuracies known as ""hallucinations."" This trend is particularly important for enterprise AI adoption, where factual accuracy is critical.
The demand for customized enterprise generative AI models is rising. Businesses are increasingly looking to tailor AI models to fit niche requirements, moving away from general-purpose tools towards models optimized for specific scenarios. This trend highlights the importance of models that cater to specialized needs, such as customer support or supply chain management, and emphasizes the growing need for AI and ML talent capable of developing and managing these systems.
The need for AI and ML talent continues to grow, particularly emphasizing skills related to AI programming, data analysis, statistics, and machine learning operations (MLOps). This demand spans beyond big tech companies, with businesses across various sectors looking to build internal AI and ML capabilities as part of their digital transformation strategies. There's also a focus on diversity within AI initiatives to mitigate biases in training data and ensure comprehensive problem-solving approaches.
Shadow AI presents a challenge as the use of AI without IT department approval or oversight becomes more common. This trend underscores the importance of governance frameworks to balance innovation and risk, especially regarding privacy and security. Organizations are encouraged to establish clear AI use policies and collaborate across departments to align on ethical and responsible AI usage.
Job Opportunities and Skills Needed
The expanding AI and ML job market offers a wide range of career opportunities, from machine learning engineers and data scientists to AI research scientists and AI application developers. Skills in demand include programming (especially in Python), data analytics, machine learning theory, and the practical application of AI technologies in business settings. Moreover, professionals are increasingly needed to manage AI projects, including deploying, monitoring, and maintaining AI systems in real-world environments, a discipline often referred to as MLOps.

Here’s How It WorksDigital cloaking tools such as Nightshade and Glaze help artists take back control from generative AI—but they’re no forever fixBy Lauren Leffer Moor Studio/Getty ImagesArtificial IntelligenceMignon Zakuga makes a living illustrating book covers and creating art for video games. But during the past year she has watched multiple would-be clients drop off her waiting list and use artificial-intelligence-generated images instead—images that have often resembled her own dark and ethereal painting style. “The first time it happened, I was pretty depressed about it,” she says. “It’s not a good feeling.” Though Zakuga is still able to get by, she worries about younger artists just starting out in the field. “This could potentially take away a lot of blooming artists’ futures,” she says.Generative AI tools are trained on mountains of data, including copyrighted imagesand text. In the coming years, courts around the world will begin deciding whether, and when, this violates copyright laws. Meanwhile artists have been left scrambling to protect their work on their own. Zakuga has found a bit of comfort in digital “cloaking” tools, such as Glaze and Nightshade, that jumble up how an AI model “sees” an image—but leave it looking effectively unchanged to human eyes. Each of these cloaking tools has its own strengths and limitations. And while using them has given artists like Zakuga some much-needed peace of mind, experts warn that these tools are not a long-term solution for protecting livelihoods.In 2022 University of Chicago computer scientists Ben Zhao and Heather Zheng began to receive e-mails from concerned artists looking to protect their work. The two had previously created a tool called Fawkes that could modify photographs to thwart facial-recognition AI, and artists wanted to know if the tool could shield their style from image-generating models such as Stable Diffusion or Midjourney. The initial answer was no, but the researchers soon began developing two new tools—Glaze and Nightshade—to try to protect artists’ work.Both programs alter an image’s pixels in subtle, systematic ways that are unobtrusive to humans but baffling to an AI model. Like optical illusions that trick human eyes, tiny visual tweaks can completely change how the AI perceives an image, says New York University computer scientist Micah Goldblum, who has developed similar cloaking tools but wasn’t involved in creating Glaze or Nightshade.These tools take advantage of vulnerabilities in an AI model’s underlying architecture. Image-generating AI systems are trained on troves of images and descriptive text, from which they learn to associate certain words with visual features such as shapes and colors. These cryptic associations are plotted within massive, multidimensional internal “maps,” with related concepts and features clustered near one another. The models use such maps as a guide to convert text prompts into newly generated images.Glaze and Nightshade both create images that muck up these internal maps, making certain unrelated concepts seem close together. To build these programs, the researchers used “feature extractors”—analytical programs that simplify these hypercomplex maps and show which concepts generative models lump together and which they separate. The researchers used this knowledge to build algorithms that modify a training image in small but targeted ways; this muddles the placement of concepts by creating incorrect associations within the model.In Glaze these alterations are aimed at masking an individual artist’s style. This can prevent models from being trained to mimic a creator’s work, Zheng explains. If fed “Glazed” images in training, an AI model might interpret an artist’s bubbly and cartoonish illustration style as if it were more like Picasso’s cubism. The more Glazed images are used to train a would-be copycat model, the more mixed up that AI’s outputs will be. Other tools such as Mist, also meant to defend artists’ unique style from AI mimicry, work similarly.Curated by Our EditorsYour Personal Information Is Probably Being Used to Train Generative AI ModelsLauren LefferSee How AI Generates Images from TextSophie Bushwick, Matthew Twombly & Amanda HobbsAI-Generated Data Can Poison Future AI ModelsRahul RaoHow This AI Image Won a Major Photography CompetitionAllison ParshallNightshade takes things further by sabotaging existing generative AI models. This cloaking tool turns potential training images into “poison” that teaches AI to incorrectly associate fundamental ideas and images. It only takes a few hundred Nightshade-treated images to retrain a generative AI model to think, for example, that a cat is a dog or that a hat is a cake. Already, Zhao says, hundreds of thousands of people have downloaded and begun deploying Nightshade to pollute the pool of AI training images.By gunking up the gears of generative AI models, Nightshade may make the training process slower or more costly for developers. This, Zhao says, could theoretically incentivize AI companies to pay for image use rights through official channels—rather than invest time in cleaning and filtering unlicensed training data scraped from the Web.Zakuga, who signed up to beta test both Glaze and Nightshade, still uses these tools regularly. She runs each piece of her art through Nightshade first and then Glaze, per Zhao’s recommendation, before uploading an image file to the Internet.Unfortunately, cloaking a single image can take hours, Zakuga says. And the tools can only help artists defend new work. If an image has already been hoovered up into an AI training data set, it’s too late to cloak it.Plus, although these tools are meant to make changes that are invisible to the human eye, sometimes they are actually noticeable—especially to the artists who created the work. “It’s not my favorite thing,” Zakuga says, but it’s a “necessary sacrifice.” Zheng says she and her colleagues are still working to find the ideal balance between disruption and maintaining an image’s integrity.More critically, there’s no guarantee that cloaking tools will work in the long term. “These are not future-proof tools,” says Gautam Kamath, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Waterloo in Ontario. At least one attempt by other academic machine-learning researchers has succeeded in partially compromising the Glaze cloak, Zhao says. Zhao believes Glaze is currently sturdy, but Goldblum notes that changes to future AI models could render the cloaking methods obsolete, particularly as developers create models that work more similarly to the human brain.Digital security “is always a cat-and-mouse game,” Zhao says. He and Zheng hope other researchers will develop complementary strategies that will all add up to stronger protection. “The important thing with Nightshade is that we proved artists don’t have to be powerless,” Zheng says.For now Kamath suggests that artists can also consider using other digital tools such as Kudduru, which detects Web scrapers and blocks their access to images on a website. But just as image cloaks have weaknesses, these blockers are not always successful against large scraping operations, Zhao notes. Artists can also put their work behind a paywall or log-in page to prevent Web scraping, though that limits their potential audience.To truly protect artists’ livelihood in the long term, Zhao, Zheng and Kamath agree that clarified copyright laws will be necessary, along with new legislation protecting creative work.In the meantime Zakuga will keep using Glaze and Nightshade for as long as she can. “It’s the best solution we have now,” she says.Lauren Leffer is a contributing writer and former tech reporting fellow at Scientific American.

Summary
Collaborating with AI solution providers is a viable strategy to stay competitive and meet evolving client demands, experts said






MUMBAI
    : 
     
      The AI prosecutor or defence attorney isn’t on the horizon, but large Indian law firms are moving rapidly to adopt artificial intelligence to carry out a string of ‘simple’ tasks including research, drafting and client presentations, helping them achieve efficiency and leaving the lawyers to focus on litigation. 


     
      Those entering the legal profession, however, need not fear for their jobs, law firms insisted, saying that AI technology would take over basic functions only. New joiners and interns at law firms—typically at the forefront of such work as part of their learning curve—would be able to cut down on efforts that include trawling voluminous data to summarize and analyze information.

How To Specialize in Artificial Intelligence

News | March 5, 2024            








Earning TROY’s Master’s degree in Computer Science is one of the most effective ways to enter the AI field.



Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the way we work — and live. From helping us solve social challenges and improving business outcomes to boosting our productivity and enhancing our creativity, the possibilities and potential of AI seem endless. 
But while recent innovations have brought AI into the spotlight, the artificial intelligence field is not new, says Dr. Suman Kumar, Associate Professor and Computer Science Department Chair at Troy University. 
“It has been evolving for decades, but now, with memory advances and graphic processing units (GPUs), we can use AI far more effectively as compared to 30 or 40 years ago,” Dr. Kumar explains. “Now, almost every industry and field uses deep learning. It is one of the most profound shifts. AI now touches almost every aspect of human life.” 
These advancements have created a heightened demand for computer scientists, machine learning engineers, data scientists, software engineers, research scientists and more. So how can you become part of this promising field? By learning how to specialize in artificial intelligence. 
Artificial Intelligence Job Opportunities Abound
AI is in the news today because of advances in large language models like ChatGPT and Google Bard, both powerful AI systems that can be used to produce content, conduct research and more. Stronger machine-learning capabilities have also greatly expanded what we can do with AI, from improving security measures with facial recognition to helping us improve our health with wearable devices that track our heart rates and activity levels. 
AI, Dr. Kumar says, is here to stay.
“All kinds of organizations, whether it’s big box retailers or health care, are becoming more and more data-driven. Algorithmic trading in the stock market is also data-driven. AI can help us make sense of that data. Government organizations, such as the IRS, can use AI to help detect fraud. Video game designers use it in game design. Cities can use it to predict traffic patterns. I’ve even seen research about its applications in dentistry. Whether someone is using it predictively to get ahead of a problem or generativity to help them create something, AI is applicable to almost any discipline.”
That means, now more than ever, professionals who can design, develop, train and improve AI are in high demand. Take computer and information research scientists, for example. 
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), jobs within this field will grow by 23% through 2032, which is much faster than average. The average annual salary is $136,620, the BLS reports.
“There are a lot of misconceptions about AI,” Dr. Kumar shares. “One of those misconceptions is that AI can never fail. AI does fail, and the field needs more humans behind it because it doesn’t have human intelligence. We design it to operate like human intelligence, but it will never truly be human.”
So, what kinds of other careers in AI are out there?
“Many artificial intelligence job opportunities will be in health care,” shares Dr. Kumar. “Health care increasingly employs artificial intelligence to help understand patient data and prevent disease. Bioinformatics, a field in which you analyze biological data, also holds promise for those interested in AI.” 
Other artificial intelligence jobs include machine learning specialist, AI researcher, data scientist, video game designer, research engineer, AI systems engineer and AI specialist. But the AI career that’s right for you depends on how you want to contribute to the field. 
“As an AI researcher, you can contribute to the development of new AI systems,” says Dr. Kumar. “As a machine learning specialist, you’ll help train those systems. If you enjoy working with data, you can become a data scientist and use data to make predictions or decisions. When you have a background in AI, you have a lot of opportunities.” 
How To Start an Artificial Intelligence Career
If you’re wondering how to start an artificial intelligence career, the first step is to learn AI. You may qualify for some roles with a bachelor’s degree, AI courses or related career experience. However, according to the BLS, a graduate degree in computer science or a related field is needed for most computer and information research jobs, including artificial intelligence job opportunities. 
If you’re already working in an entry-level role, a master’s degree can help you advance because you’ll develop the mathematical knowledge, programming skills and research experience you need to excel in AI jobs. 
“The artificial intelligence field — and, more broadly, computer science — grew out of mathematics,” notes Dr. Kumar. “To be successful in AI jobs, you have to be skilled in math. Much of machine learning is math, so the better you are at math, the better you’ll perform. A master’s in computer science program provides you with a strong foundation in math, programming and data science to prepare you for careers in AI.” 
Working on AI-related projects and taking graduate courses in machine learning and data science can give you an advantage in the job market. You’ll want to choose a graduate program led by faculty who are knowledgeable about trends in the field. You may also want to choose an area of specialization, such as bioinformatics, to expand your career opportunities. 
How To Specialize in Artificial Intelligence 
While there are many paths to an artificial intelligence specialization, earning TROY’s master’s in computer science is one of the most effective ways to enter the AI field. TROY offers an M.S. in computer science with a specialization in artificial intelligence to help you develop technical knowledge and skills for AI jobs. 
“Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science which is interdisciplinary,” says Dr. Kumar. “An artificial intelligence specialization will give you interdisciplinary study in computer science along with experience in designing and implementing AI systems. These skills are among the most needed in the AI industry.” 
Choosing an M.S. in computer science with a specialization in artificial intelligence will ensure you have those skills, along with machine learning, programming and data analysis. TROY’s master’s in computer science program, with a thesis and non-thesis track, will also help you gain research experience and build your portfolio. TROY’s program emphasizes project-based learning to give you further advantage. 
“Our program is very hands-on,” shares Dr. Kumar. “In our courses, we try to come up with real-life problems for our students to solve. Then, students practice creating solutions to those real-world problems, learning advanced research skills, machine learning and other skills along the way.” 
For example, students in the artificial intelligence specialization at TROY have worked on using AI to prevent cybersecurity attacks. They’ve also completed projects in transportation and routing. One student even used AI to predict winning baseball teams, which could have applications in TROY’s sports management program.
“All of our projects are practical and applicable in real life. What the students find in their projects is fascinating, but more importantly, useful,” says Dr. Kumar.

Submit it here.Question: My job does not have a policy for the use of artificial intelligence. I started regularly using generative AI in my work but have yet to tell my boss. Should I let him know that I use ChatGPT for work? – CalebAnswer: Absolutely, it's crucial to communicate with your boss about your use of generative AI tools like ChatGPT for work, even if there isn't a formal AI policy in place at your workplace. Here are a few points to consider when discussing this with your boss:◾ Data security: Address the issue of data security upfront. Underscore that while generative AI is a valuable tool, you are mindful of the sensitivity of the information it processes. Assure your boss you will refrain from entering proprietary or confidential information into ChatGPT and are willing to turn off chat history to uphold data security if requested.◾ Misinformation verification: Acknowledge the potential for discrepancies in the information provided by AI tools. Emphasize your understanding of the significance of verifying any information obtained via generative AI to ensure accuracy. This commitment to fact-checking will help maintain the reliability of the work you produce.◾ Overreliance on AI: Address the concern of overreliance on generative AI tools. Acknowledge that while AI is a powerful aid in generating content, you are cautious to keep it from overshadowing your own authentic voice. Share your approach to using AI as a starting point, incorporating your personal touch, and avoiding a copy-and-paste mentality.◾ Ethical considerations: Discuss the ethical considerations if you are using AI to influence decisions or products. Highlight your awareness of the importance of maintaining ethical standards in your work. Assure your boss you approach AI as a supplementary tool and that your decisions align with the company's ethical principles.◾ Seek feedback: Express your willingness to receive feedback on your use of AI and inquire if there are specific tasks or areas where your boss would like you to apply this technology. This proactive approach demonstrates your openness to collaboration and aligning AI usage with your company's objectives.Ultimately, artificial intelligence should complement and elevate human intelligence and capability, not replace it. Ensuring your uniquely human intellect and intuition are involved in an operation aided by AI will deliver the best possible outcome. By addressing these considerations and having an open conversation with your boss, you not only ensure transparency in your work but also contribute to the ongoing dialogue around AI usage in your workplace. Your proactive approach could even help shape a future AI policy to suit your company's needs and values. IntimidationWhat is the best way to handle bullying at work?

Generative AI technology depends on large language models (LLMs) trained on volumes of data that can continue to learn (and therefore provide better responses) based on information that users enter when they prompt or ask the platform questions.While much of the information coming out about generative AI surrounds publicly available platforms, such as ChatGPT, law firms and companies have started creating their own proprietary tools or engaging vendors to customize generative AI tools for internal use to increase the accuracy of generative AI’s responses and protect confidential information.By giving generative AI the right prompts (see Box, How to Create Effective Prompts for Generative AI in Legal Work) and sufficient supporting documents or information, generative AI can help attorneys perform certain types of legal work more efficiently, including by creating initial drafts of documents, summarizing documents, and providing starting points for legal research.This article discusses key issues litigators should consider with respect to generative AI, including the risks and limitations of using generative AI, the potential uses of generative AI in various stages of litigation, the applicable procedural and ethical rules, and best practices for creating effective prompts when using generative AI to perform litigation work.Practical Law The JournalRegister for FREE to continue readingFree and easy registration gives you unlimited access to Practical Law The Journal.RegisterAlready have an account?

In fact, only 27 percent of knowledge workers feel they have a healthy relationship with their work. That’s a significant problem—for employees and for businesses, as no company can succeed in the long term without a motivated and engaged workforce. HP Inc’s Work Relationship Index, which aimed to learn more about people's relationships with their jobs, surveyed 15,600 respondents in 12 countries across various industries and countries, including India. The findings reveal that morale is low in workplaces across the globe. While some people have feared that AI may replace human workers, there is a growing perspective that AI can actually improve relationships at work. More than 55 per cent of workers surveyed said artificial intelligence will open up new opportunities at work while 75 per cent of business leaders said AI will make jobs easier. “AI represents a significant opportunity to transform our work dynamics and unlock a more positive and productive environment for all,"" said Dave Shull, President of HP Workforce Solutions at HP Inc. ahead of the HP Amplify Partner Conference in Las Vegas. Is AI a threat to jobs? Generative AI isn’t the most buzzed topic in tech, but it is also changing the workforce and organizations. Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence capable of generating images, text, or other content. The technology is expected to boost productivity, cut costs, and create new growth opportunities across a wide range of industries. Ever since the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, an AI chatbot built on a large language model that helps users come up with answers to questions, it has sparked debate about the potential of how AI can revolutionize industries and work — and possibly even make jobs redundant. How do I keep up in the AI-dominated world? To keep up with workloads in the AI-centric job market, 73 percent of business leaders and 66 percent of knowledge workers surveyed said there is a need for proper AI training. However, the study shows there is uncertainty over the implementation of AI in the workspace. In fact, nearly 42 percent of knowledge workers don’t know when to use AI at work. While AI is unlikely to solve problems overnight, the survey found that the technology is giving some hope for the future. A majority of workers believe it is the responsibility of business leaders to implement the right AI strategy in the workplace and educate employees on the benefits of AI, according to the survey. AI is expected to automate more “routine-oriented” tasks which used to be a significant part of daily work, leaving employees with more time to spend on tasks that are more knowledge-oriented.

As the world embraces the transformative power of artificial intelligence, concerns about its potential impact on employment, particularly for women, have gained prominence. Drawing insights from developed countries by examining the trends, opportunities, and actions (policies) the impact of AI on women’s jobs or employment in Africa can be assessed.
The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has ushered in a new era of technological advancements with the potential to change the landscape of the global job market. While the application of AI promises increased efficiency and innovation, it has come with concerns about its impact on employment. The fear is that AI will take over jobs because it is able to do what man can do. And true to this prediction, to an extent, this is happening. In Bavaria Germany, in 2023, there was the report of AI leading service in a church and preaching instead of a pastor. This fear of job loss is general but it is particularly so for vulnerable groups such as women.  
AI will have its advantages and disadvantages. Research shows that there will be creation of new jobs which is positive. However, there are concerns that AI will lead to job loss as well as job displacement. The fear which is equality or gender-related is that women will probably be more affected by job loss or displacement than men. This is because there are more women in the customer service, food service, social service or community service sector, areas that are predicted to be affected by the growth of AI. Despite the prediction that AI will create new jobs, few women will benefit due to the number of women in STEM. The assumption is based on the type of jobs that have been affected by the deployment of AI in developed countries. In the US for example, powered by artificial intelligence, new technologies are taking over tasks not only from warehouse workers but also from white-collar workers and professionals. Automated teller machines have taken over the tasks of bank tellers; accounting software has automated the work of bookkeepers. Now computers can diagnose breast cancer from X-rays and predict survival rates at least as well as the average radiologist. The impact of AI is expected to affect more women than men.   
This essay analyses the anticipated consequences of AI on women’s jobs in Africa, leveraging the experiences, responses, and management of the development by developed countries as a lens for exploration. It also links to the discourse of the future of work which is an emerging discourse. The importance of these discourses is that they top topical issues in the general global discourse today. 
THE GLOBAL LANDSCAPE OF AI AND EMPLOYMENT
To understand the potential impact of AI on women’s jobs in Africa, it is crucial to examine the global landscape as well as the status quo in Africa. It is trite, by virtue of early application, developed countries have witnessed significant transformations in their labour markets due to the integration of AI technologies. Automation, machine learning, and robotics have led to the displacement of certain jobs while creating new opportunities in sectors requiring advanced technical skills. For example, in industries such as health care, transport and logistics, customer service, and home maintenance. In the health industry in South Africa, as of 2020, AI could access health, prescribe, and dispense drugs to patients. In 2023, almost 4,000 American jobs were reported to have been lost following the adoption of AI. 
This raises concerns about the feminization of job losses in the face of AI advancements. Professor Gina Neff, the executive director of the Minderoo Centre for Technology & Democracy at the University of Cambridge and member of the Women4AI Daring Circle believes the existing gaps in digital skills between men and women globally is one key factor that would influence this discourse. According to her, this is disturbing and more concerted efforts must be taken to remedy the situation. Furthermore, studies from developed nations like the US, emphasize the importance of upskilling and reskilling to mitigate the negative impacts of AI on employment.  
Again, the existing gender disparities in the workforce may exacerbate the impact of AI on women. A 2022 UNESCO study reveals that women are underrepresented in industries at the forefront of AI development, limiting their participation in the sector. As AI increasingly becomes integrated into various sectors, the result of these disparities may be further inequality in opportunities for women in the job market in the future.  
Moreover, biases in AI algorithms can perpetuate gender stereotypes and discrimination as already witnessed and evident by some research. For example, a programme will often translate the English term ‘nurse’ using a female-gendered word, and render ‘doctor’ as a male noun. This bias in AI has the potential to widen the gender gap, and even endanger women’s lives. It can also lead to discrimination in fair decision making. For example, it can influence women not getting jobs or accessing loans for their businesses.  The solution to this can be gender-inclusive policies. 
THE STATUS QUO OF WOMEN’S EMPLOYMENT IN AFTICA AND THE POSSIBILITIES THAT COME WITH AI
Traditionally, cultural norms and gender stereotypes have limited women’s access to job opportunities, resulting in a persistent gender gap in employment. In many African societies, gender roles have often dictated that women prioritize domestic responsibilities over pursuing a career. Cultural norms have perpetuated stereotypes that limit women’s participation in the formal workforce, relegating them to lower-paying and less prestigious roles. 
Historically, women in Africa have faced challenges in accessing quality education and vocational training. This has resulted in a skills gap, further restricting their entry into higher-paying and more technologically advanced industries. Hence the job market in Africa has been characterized by occupational segregation, with women often concentrated in sectors such as agriculture, healthcare, and informal services, especially low-quality jobs. The high illiteracy level among women in Africa is more glaring in the area of STEM. The resulting situation is the digital divide or gap which is the lack of women in the mentioned fields. This becomes relevant within the discourse of the impact of AI on women’s jobs as only a few women are employed in the STEM sector and the sectors where they are more employed, are easily taken over by AI. 
The integration of AI in various industries has the potential to break down traditional barriers to employment for women. Remote work facilitated by AI technologies can provide flexibility, allowing women to balance work and family responsibilities more effectively. 
AI-driven initiatives in education and training can help bridge the skills gap for women. Online courses, AI-driven learning platforms, and virtual training programmes offer accessible opportunities for skill development, that have the potentials to empower women to enter industries or employment that were erstwhile male-dominated. Although more efforts will be required for hands-on or practical technology education. AI has the potential to disrupt occupational segregation by introducing automation and innovation across various sectors. As routine tasks become automated, opportunities for women to participate in more diverse and technologically advanced roles may increase. 
Generally, although women in Africa have faced systemic challenges in the workforce, the advent of AI presents a transformative opportunity to address these issues. By breaking down traditional barriers, closing the skills gap, and promoting gender-inclusive AI technologies, Africa can foster a more equitable and diverse job market. All these have been noticed in developed countries. However, it is essential for policymakers, businesses, and communities to actively work towards creating an inclusive environment that harnesses the full potential of AI for the benefit of women in the workforce. 
LESSONS FROM DEVELOPED COUNTRIES
Africa presents a unique context for examining the impact of AI on women’s jobs. The continent is characterized by diverse economies, ranging from resource-rich nations to emerging markets. Many African countries are still grappling with basic infrastructure challenges and other problems which contribute to making the adoption of advanced technologies like AI a complex or additional challenge. 
However, several African nations like Kenya and South Africa are making strides in embracing digital transformation. Initiatives such as the African Union’s Digital Transformation Strategy aim to harness the potential of technology for economic growth and job creation. The implications of AI on women’s employment in Africa need to be examined within this broader economic context. 
While the economic and technological contexts of developed countries differ from those in Africa, analyzing their experiences can provide valuable insights. Developed countries have taken organized steps and strategies which developing countries can take lessons by adapting to the changing nature of work due to AI. While the use and thus the impact of AI on jobs in Africa may be different from how it is in developed countries, it is still worth researching. Some of the reasons for the difference may be considerable issues of time and development, the practical reality of automation itself and many others which might determine the full use of AI and thus the envisaged impact. 
Although job displacement is a concern, the advent of AI also brings forth opportunities for skill shifts and upskilling. As routine tasks become automated, there is a growing demand for skills related to AI development, maintenance, and oversight. This shift offers women the chance to engage in high-skilled roles within the AI ecosystem. Initiatives promoting STEM education for women are crucial in ensuring they have the necessary skills to thrive in the evolving job market. 
Gender Bias in AI Algorithms is an often-overlooked aspect of the impact of AI on women’s employment. If not properly designed and monitored, AI systems can perpetuate existing gender stereotypes and inequalities. For instance, biased recruitment algorithms may disadvantage women in job application processes. Addressing these biases is crucial to ensuring fair and equitable opportunities for women in the AI-driven job market. 
Another opportunity is remote and flexible work arrangements. For women, these changes can provide greater flexibility in balancing work and family responsibilities. Remote work facilitated by AI technologies has the potential to reduce traditional gender-based barriers and empower women to participate more actively in the labour market. 
Efforts are underway to develop AI systems that are free from gender bias. This is crucial in ensuring fair hiring practices, performance evaluations, and promotions, thereby contributing to a more equitable work environment for women. 
One of the primary factors influencing women’s participation in AI-related fields is access to education and training. In developed countries, considerable efforts have been and are being made to bridge gender gaps in STEM education. However, in many African countries, there are still significant disparities in educational opportunities for women. Addressing these gaps is crucial for ensuring that women in Africa can participate meaningfully in the AI job market. 
Diversity in the AI workforce is essential for creating inclusive and effective technologies. Developed countries have made strides in promoting gender diversity, though challenges persist. In Africa, efforts to build a diverse AI workforce are at an early stage. Governments and businesses must actively work towards creating an environment that encourages women to pursue careers in AI and related fields. 
AI has the potential to drive entrepreneurship and innovation. The UK for example has seen a rise in women-led startups and innovative projects in AI. In Africa, although progress is being made, there is a need for greater support for women entrepreneurs in AI. This includes access to funding, mentorship programs, and a supportive ecosystem that encourages risk-taking and innovation. 
Meanwhile, the relationship between computers and humans is not determined by technological capabilities, but by the priorities and strategies of organizations that own and operate them. Most times, this has to do with development and or rather the society. In developed countries, efforts are being made to retrain workers and ensure a smooth transition. In Africa, where traditional employment is still a significant part of the economy, there is a need for proactive strategies to mitigate potential risks associated with AI. This includes investing in upskilling and reskilling programs tailored to the specific needs of women in the workforce. 
Countries have been developing policies and regulations to address the ethical implications of AI and promote fair employment practices. In Africa, there is a need for robust policy frameworks that not only address ethical concerns but also promote gender equality in the AI sector.  
In essence, it can be argued that the impact of artificial intelligence on women’s employment in developed countries is a complex and multifaceted issue. While concerns about job displacement exist, opportunities for upskilling, gender bias mitigation, and flexible work arrangements also emerge. The projection is that policymakers, employers, and educational institutions must collaborate to ensure that women are equipped with the skills needed for the AI-driven job market and that AI technologies contribute to gender equality rather than exacerbate existing disparities. 
Efforts to address gender disparities in AI-related fields, such as the implementation of diversity and inclusion programmes, can serve as a model for African countries seeking to ensure equitable participation of women in the technology sector. Additionally, proactive measures in education and training can empower women with the skills needed for AI-related jobs. 
POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
Upskilling programmes are necessary and a host of other inclusive strategies like gender mainstreaming, policies etc. Policies would handle most of the underlying concerns about the use of AI. These will include various strategies to address gender disparities in STEM education through targeted outreach programmes, scholarships, and mentorship initiatives to inspire and support young women pursuing STEM careers. Encouraging women to participate in shaping the development of AI technologies can help mitigate biases and ensure equitable outcomes. 
This work would require all hands on deck, a unified work by all stakeholders. Governments should formulate inclusive AI policies that address gender biases and discrimination and work with the private sector, academia, and civil society to develop ethical guidelines for AI development and deployment.  
Governments and organizations should invest in digital skills training programs to empower women with the skills needed for AI-related jobs. These programmes should be accessible to women across different socioeconomic backgrounds, with a focus on providing practical, hands-on training in AI technologies. Bridging the skills gap will enhance women’s employability in the evolving job market. 
The anticipated impact of artificial intelligence on women’s jobs in Africa is a multifaceted issue that requires a comprehensive and proactive approach. AI will have both benefits and disadvantages. The disadvantages are general concerns from its benefits. General assumptions of the global impact of AI on employment include job loss and job displacement. From the assumption of the type of jobs that women are mostly found, as brought about by gender perception, discrimination and disparities, which are more visible in Africa, it is easy to deduce that women will be more affected by job loss and displacement than men. However way it is, women will be affected differently from men.  
While progress is being made, concerted efforts are needed to ensure that women in Africa can fully participate in and benefit from the opportunities presented by the AI revolution. A comprehensive and inclusive approach is essential to unlock the potential of AI for women in Africa and contribute to sustainable and equitable economic development. 
Addressing the gender disparities in STEM education, promoting gender diversity in AI development, fostering inclusive AI policies, and investing in digital skills training are essential components of a strategic response. Policymakers, businesses, and civil society in Africa must collaborate to ensure that women are not left behind in the evolving landscape of AI employment. All these are lessons from developed countries that African countries can assess to navigate the challenges and leverage the opportunities presented by AI⎈

The IT company has an AI deal pipeline of $50 million. Out of 6,532, about 2,000 employees are trained in generative AI currently and the company wants 50% of its staff to be trained in generative AI in the coming year. Sonata already has generative AI projects in the telecom and hi-tech space. In the telecom space, the company said, a UK-based telecom provider has signed a 3-year contract in automation and here generative AI is being used, Dhir said. The company expects 20% of its revenue, in the next three years, to come from artificial intelligence-related work. The firm is pursuing 40 large deals currently and of its entire portfolio, large deals amount to 48%. While other IT companies are being cautious of campus hiring this year, Dhir said Sonata Software will not slowdown. “We hire about 500-600 people each year. This trend will continue. We are not going to slow down on campus hires,” Dhir said. Even on the total headcount addition, the firm will add around the same 250-odd employees each quarter. “Annually, we want to continue increasing our headcount by 15% to 16%,” the chief executive officer said. Sonata Software has a goal of reaching a revenue of $1.5 billion by the end of the 2025-26 financial year. For the December quarter, the IT firm reported a revenue of $83.7 million, a sequential increase of 3% in constant currency terms. Compared to the same quarter of the previous fiscal, the revenue increase has been 37% in constant currency terms. However, the company made a loss of $10.8 million in the October to December quarter of FY24. This, the company management said, was due to an additional $17 million payout to Quant and Encore, both of which were acquired by Sonata.We also published the following articles recentlyBumble to cut about 350 roles, forecasts weak first-quarter revenueBumble cuts 350 roles after disappointing Q1 revenue.

<p>Imagine a world where machines can learn, adapt, and even make decisions. This isn't science fiction, it's the reality of Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI has become a powerful tool, used in everything from smartphones to healthcare. But this rapid advancement also raises concerns, especially about its impact on jobs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>What is AI?</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Think of AI as a computer program that can think and learn like a human, at least in some ways. It can:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Analyse information:</strong>&nbsp;AI can process massive amounts of data, finding patterns and connections that humans might miss.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Make decisions:</strong>&nbsp;Based on its analysis, AI can make decisions, sometimes even better than humans, especially for repetitive tasks.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Adapt and learn:</strong>&nbsp;AI systems can continuously learn and improve as they are exposed to new data and experiences.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Imagine a program that can learn to play chess just by playing against itself, or a program that can translate languages by analyzing millions of examples of translated text. That's the power of AI, and it's still evolving.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Artificial Intelligence - Boon or Bane</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, let's address the big question: Is AI a blessing or a curse? Well, it's a bit of both.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Boon:</strong> AI has the potential to revolutionise industries across the board. From healthcare to transportation, AI-powered systems can enhance efficiency, accuracy, and productivity. For instance, in healthcare, AI algorithms can analyse medical data to diagnose diseases more accurately and suggest personalised treatment plans. In transportation, self-driving cars powered by AI could reduce accidents and congestion, making roads safer for everyone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Furthermore, AI can automate tedious and repetitive tasks, freeing up human workers to focus on more creative and high-value activities. This could lead to a surge in innovation and economic growth, creating new opportunities for job creation in AI-related fields.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bane:</strong> However, the rapid advancement of AI also raises concerns about job displacement. As machines become more adept at performing tasks traditionally done by humans, certain jobs may become obsolete. For example, routine tasks in manufacturing, customer service, and data entry could be automated, leading to layoffs or job reassignments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moreover, AI's ability to analyse vast amounts of data and make predictions could threaten jobs in sectors like finance, where routine decision-making is prevalent. This could exacerbate existing inequalities, as those with specialised skills or access to education and training in AI-related fields may thrive, while others face unemployment or underemployment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>Future of AI</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly changing the world, and its impact is only predicted to grow in the coming years. While the exact details remain uncertain, experts paint a picture filled with both incredible possibilities and important challenges.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Revolutionizing Industries:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Healthcare:</strong>&nbsp;AI can help doctors diagnose diseases, discover new drugs, and even create personalized treatment plans. Imagine AI assistants helping patients even when doctors aren't available.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Education:</strong>&nbsp;AI tutors could personalize learning based on each student's needs and strengths, allowing everyone to learn at their own pace.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Finance:</strong>&nbsp;AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data to make better investment decisions, potentially leading to a more stable and efficient financial system. Imagine robots helping manage investment funds with greater speed and accuracy.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Future of Transportation:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Self-driving cars are no longer science fiction. These smart cars are already being tested, and they hold the potential to revolutionize transportation, making it safer and more efficient. Imagine cars that can drive themselves, reducing traffic accidents and congestion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>AI and Advertising:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>AI can help businesses create targeted advertising campaigns that reach the right audience, saving them time and money. Imagine using AI to predict which ads will be most effective for specific groups of people.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3 class=""wp-block-heading""><strong>AI's</strong> <strong>Impact on Jobs</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked concerns about its impact on the job market. Experts predict that millions of jobs could be affected by AI as machines become more capable of handling tasks currently done by humans. However, it's important to understand that this doesn't necessarily mean widespread unemployment. While some jobs may be lost, new ones will likely emerge in different fields as AI technology continues to develop. This highlights the importance of continuous learning and skill development to adapt to the changing needs of the future workforce. The precise impact of AI on jobs remains uncertain, and some experts suggest that educated white-collar workers and those in manufacturing might be more affected initially. Regardless of the specific predictions, it's clear that AI will play a significant role in shaping the future of work.</p>
