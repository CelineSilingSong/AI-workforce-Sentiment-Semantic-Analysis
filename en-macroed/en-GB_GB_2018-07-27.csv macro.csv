This article was originally published in the Summer 2018 issue of The Record.
When asked how artificial intelligence (AI) will improve our lives, many people think of high-profile examples such as autonomous cars and smart homes. However, AI may be making the fastest inroads where people spend most of their waking hours: the workplace. But how will AI change the nature of work?
DXC Technology believes AI will be key for facilitating the flexible, productive workstyle that today’s workforce expects. AI, robotics and machine learning will shift how people work, replacing highly manual and repetitive jobs on both the factory floor and in the office. However, these roles will be replaced by an equal, or greater, number of jobs in new areas that require more creativity and critical thinking. In fact, a 2017 CCS Insight survey found that almost 50% of the 650 respondents think AI will increase the number of available jobs. When millennials are isolated from that respondent group, that figure jumps to 64%. 
Currently filling peripheral roles in the workplace, AI is rapidly working its way towards playing a larger role. For example, IT administrators are using AI to support bring your own device policies by putting guardrails around devices to safeguard corporate data and ensure that everything employees do can be audited. In addition, the technology can identify undetected malware and other vulnerabilities, or intervene when users take risks.
AI can make employees more productive by guiding them through various processes. Workers who shift from one device to another throughout the day, for example, might benefit from AI-assisted authentication and automated workflow. This could end the error-prone routine of manually tracking document revisions or e-mailing attachments from one device to another.
How we interact with AI-powered systems is changing rapidly too. Conversational systems provide a natural, easy-to-use interface for user-requested actions. They’re also increasingly capable of monitoring conversations, taking notes, documenting action items and creating calendar entries without prompting, which is ideal for meetings. Meanwhile, chatbots are quickly improving employee and customer experiences by immediately answering simple technical questions and providing step-by-step assistance to resolve common issues. Plus, AI can automatically and accurately translate between languages, which will benefit global companies interacting with customers in multiple countries.
AI has grown exponentially over the past few years and will continue to play a pivotal role for DXC – we’re using it to give employees and customers the power to be more productive and they’re responding eagerly.

While there is still much to overcome to achieve AI-dependent health care, most notably data privacy concerns and fears of mismanaged care due to machine error and lack of human oversight, there is sufficient potential that governments, tech companies, and healthcare providers are willing to invest and test out AI-powered tools and solutions. Here are five of the AI advances in healthcare that appear to have the most potential.

1.        AI-assisted robotic surgery
With an estimated value of $40 billion to healthcare, robots can analyze data from pre-op medical records to guide a surgeon's instrument during surgery, which can lead to a 21% reduction in a patient's hospital stay. Robot-assisted surgery is considered ""minimally invasive"" so patients won't need to heal from large incisions. Via artificial intelligence, robots can use data from past operations to inform new surgical techniques. The positive results are indeed promising. One study that involved 379 orthopedic patients found that AI-assisted robotic procedure resulted in five times fewer complications compared to surgeons operating alone. A robot was used on an eye surgery for the first time, and the most advanced surgical robot, the Da Vinci allows doctors to perform complex procedures with greater control than conventional approaches. Heart surgeons are assisted Heartlander, a miniature robot, that enters a small incision on the chest to perform mapping and therapy over the surface of the heart.





2.        Virtual nursing assistants
PROMOTED
From interacting with patients to directing patients to the most effective care setting, virtual nursing assistants could save the healthcare industry $20 billion annually. Since virtual nurses are available 24/7, they can answer questions, monitor patients and provide quick answers. Most applications of virtual nursing assistants today allow for more regular communication between patients and care providers between office visits to prevent hospital readmission or unnecessary hospital visits. Care Angel's virtual nurse assistant can even provide wellness checks through voice and AI.

3.        Aid clinical judgment or diagnosis
Admittedly, using AI to diagnose patients is undoubtedly in its infancy, but there have been some exciting use cases. A Stanford University study tested an AI algorithm to detect skin cancers against dermatologists, and it performed at the level of the humans. A Danish AI software company tested its deep-learning program by having a computer eavesdrop while human dispatchers took emergency calls. The algorithm analyzed what a person says, the tone of voice and background noise and detected cardiac arrests with a 93% success rate compared to 73% for humans. Baidu Research recently announced that the results of early tests on its deep learning algorithm indicate that it can outperform humans when identifying breast cancer metastasis. Prime minister Theresa May announced an AI revolution would help the National Health Service (NHS), the UK's healthcare system, predict those in an early stage of cancer to ultimately prevent thousands of cancer-related deaths by 2033. The algorithms will examine medical records, habits and genetic information pooled from health charities, the NHS and AI.
4.        Workflow and administrative tasks
Another way AI can impact healthcare is to automate administrative tasks. It is expected that this could result in $18 billion in savings for the healthcare industry as machines can help doctors, nurses and other providers save time on tasks. Technology such as voice-to-text transcriptions could help order tests, prescribe medications and write chart notes. One example of using AI to support admin tasks is a partnership between the Cleveland Clinic and IBM that uses IBM’s Watson to mine big data and help physicians provide a personalized and more efficient treatment experience. One way Watson supports physicians is being able to analyze thousands of medical papers using natural language processing to inform treatment plans.

5.        Image analysis
Currently, image analysis is very time consuming for human providers, but an MIT-led research team developed a machine-learning algorithm that can analyze 3D scans up to 1,000 times faster than what is possible today. This near real-time assessment can provide critical input for surgeons who are operating. It is also hoped that AI can help to improve the next generation of radiology tools that don’t rely on tissue samples. Additionally, AI image analysis could support remote areas that don’t have easy access to healthcare providers and even make telemedicine more effective as patients can use their camera phones to send in pics of rashes, cuts or bruises to determine what care is necessary.
In the very complex world of healthcare, AI tools can support human providers to provide faster service, diagnose issues and analyze data to identify trends or genetic information that would predispose someone to a particular disease. When saving minutes can mean saving lives, AI and machine learning can be transformative not only for healthcare but for every single patient.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/07/27/how-is-ai-used-in-healthcare-5-powerful-real-world-examples-that-show-the-latest-advances/,Enterprise & Cloud,How Is AI Used In Healthcare - 5 Powerful Real-World Examples That Show The Latest Advances,False,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Forbes Homepage', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Innovation', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/innovation/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Enterprise Tech', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/enterprise-tech/'}]",,,,,,

Purchasing a home or car is an exciting moment in a person’s life. Consumers may be comfortable with and even appreciate data-driven recommendations in the search process, for example, from websites that suggest homes based on properties they’ve previously viewed. But what if the decision to grant a mortgage or auto loan is made by a machine-learning algorithm? And what if the logic behind that algorithm’s decision, especially if it rejects the application, is unclear? It’s hard enough being denied a loan after going through the traditional process; being turned down by an artificial intelligence (AI)–powered system that can’t be explained is that much worse. Consumers are left with no way to know how to improve their chance of success in the future.
Elsewhere, for patients and their doctors, the promise of AI programs that can detect signs of disease at ever-earlier stages is cause for celebration. But it can also be cause for consternation. When it comes to medical diagnoses, the stakes are exceedingly high; a misdiagnosis could lead to unnecessary and risky surgery or to the deterioration of the patient’s health. Physicians must trust the AI system in order to confidently use it as a diagnostic tool, and patients must also trust the system if they are to have confidence in their diagnosis.

As more and more companies in a range of industries adopt machine learning and more advanced AI algorithms, such as deep neural networks, their ability to provide understandable explanations for all the different stakeholders becomes critical. Yet some machine-learning models that underlie AI applications qualify as black boxes, meaning we can’t always understand exactly how a given algorithm has decided what action to take. It is human nature to distrust what we don’t understand, and much about AI may not be completely clear. And since distrust goes hand in hand with lack of acceptance, it becomes imperative for companies to open the black box.
Deep neural networks are complicated algorithms modeled after the human brain, designed to recognize patterns by grouping raw data into discrete mathematical components known as vectors. In the case of medical diagnosis, this raw data could come from patient imaging. For a bank loan, the raw data would be made up of payment history, defaulted loans, credit score, perhaps some demographic information, other risk estimates, and so on. The system then learns by processing all this data, and each layer of the deep neural network learns to recognize progressively more complex features. With sufficient training, the AI may become highly accurate. But its decision processes are not always transparent.

To open up the AI black box and facilitate trust, companies must develop AI systems that perform reliably — that is, make correct decisions — time after time. The machine-learning models on which the systems are based must also be transparent, explainable, and able to achieve repeatable results. We call this combination of features an AI model’s interpretability. 
It is important to note that there can be a trade-off between performance and interpretability. For example, a simpler model may be easier to understand, but it won’t be able to process complex data or relationships. Getting this trade-off right is primarily the domain of developers and analysts. But business leaders should have a basic understanding of what determines whether a model is interpretable, as this is a key factor in determining an AI system’s legitimacy in the eyes of the business’s employees and customers.
Data integrity and the possibility of unintentional biases are also a concern when integrating AI. In a 2017 PwC CEO Pulse survey, 76 percent of respondents said potential for biases and lack of transparency were impeding AI adoption in their enterprise. Seventy-three percent said the same about the need to ensure governance and rules to control AI. Consider the example of the AI-powered mortgage loan application evaluation system. What if it started denying applications from a certain demographic because of human or systemic biases in the data? Or imagine if an airport security system’s AI program singled out certain individuals for additional screening at airport security on the basis of their race or ethnicity.
Business leaders faced with ensuring interpretability, consistent performance, and data integrity will have to work closely with their organization’s developers and analysts. Developers are responsible for building the machine learning model, selecting the algorithms used for the AI application, and verifying that the AI was built correctly and continues to perform as expected. Analysts are responsible for validating the AI model created by the developers to be sure the model addresses the business need at hand. Finally, management is responsible for the decision to deploy the system, and must be prepared to take responsibility for the business impact.

A Strategist’s Guide to Artificial Intelligence

For any organization that wants to get the best out of AI, it is important for people to clearly understand and adhere to these roles and responsibilities. Ultimately, the goal is to design a machine-learning model (or tune an existing one) for a given AI application so that the company can maximize performance while comprehensively addressing any operational or reputational concerns.
Leaders will also need to follow the evolving AI regulatory environment. Such regulatory requirements are not extensive now, but more are likely to emerge over time. In Europe, for example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) took effect on May 25, 2018, and will require companies — including U.S. companies that do business in Europe — to take measures to protect customers’ privacy and eventually ensure the transparency of algorithms that impact consumers.
Finally, executives should bear in mind that every AI application will differ in the degree to which there is a risk to human safety. If the risk is great and the role of the human operator significantly reduced, then the need for the AI model to be reliable, easily explained, and clearly understood is high. This would be the case, for example, with a self-driving car, a self-flying passenger jet, or a fully automated cancer diagnosis process.
Other AI applications won’t put people’s health or lives at risk — for example, AI that screens mortgage applications or that runs a marketing campaign. But because of the potential for biased data or results, a reasonable level of interpretability is still required. Ultimately, the company must be comfortable with, and be able to explain to customers, the reasons the system approved one application over another or targeted a specific group of consumers in a campaign.
Opening the black box in which some complex AI models have previously functioned will require companies to ensure that for any AI system, the machine-learning model performs to the standards the business requires, and that company leaders can justify the outcomes. Those that do will help reduce risks and establish the trust required for AI to become a truly accepted means of spurring innovation and achieving business goals — many of which have not yet even been imagined.

School leaders and education researchers often rely on test scores to judge how well students are learning. But that ignores many important aspects of learning, such as the liveliness of classroom discussion or how engaged and motivated the students are. Expert observers in a classroom can immediately pick up on these unquantifiable moments of great teaching. But human observations are time-consuming and expensive. You can videotape classrooms, but it can be just as tedious and costly to code and analyze the recordings afterward.

Thanks to advances in artificial intelligence, teams of education researchers and computer scientists are experimenting with how to build systems that can “see” into and “listen” in on classrooms and instantly analyze the quality of classroom instruction. The technology is improving rather rapidly now, thanks to improvements in natural language processing and automatic speech recognition. At the same time, it takes an enormous amount of work just to teach the robots how to observe one micro aspect of a classroom at a time.

One team of scientists is focused on a type of question that middle school English teachers ask students. There are all kinds of questions that an English teacher might pose, from the names of characters in a story to what happens next in a plot. Teachers might ask what the students think the author’s main themes are. But Sean Kelly, a sociologist at the University of Pittsburgh School of Education, is most interested in something called “authentic” questions, for which there are no pre-ordained answers. For example, why do you think that Nathaniel Hawthorne chose to give Hester Prynne a female child instead of a male child? Would the sex of the child make a difference in “A Scarlet Letter”?  Kelly’s earlier low-tech research found that teachers who ask lots of authentic questions tended to create exciting classrooms full of lively discussions, in which students ultimately learned more.
 
 

Kelly and his team of three computer scientists and one English professor succeeded in building a computer model that came close to an expert educator’s ability to discern when a teacher was asking students an “authentic” question. The results of this AI experiment were published June 2018 in Educational Researcher.

“I’m sure if you just let the engineers loose, they could come up with a program that would give teachers all sorts of feedback,” said Kelly. “But would that be the same feedback that a content expert would give? That’s what our research is all about. We were very happy to see reliabilities as high as we did.”
Before you would use this in the real world, you’d want not only more accurate algorithms, but also the ability to discern many more elements of classroom discussions. Kelly dreams of a future when algorithmic observer robots might be able to give student teachers instant feedback to improve their instruction. “You could potentially do it right there at the end of the lesson,” said Kelly. “The beauty of an automated system is that you could potentially collect large amounts of data very efficiently.”  Policymakers could use this tool to get a sense of how different curriculum are playing out in classrooms across an entire state.
These AI systems don’t involve robots in the sci-fi or cartoon sense. The researchers began with human observers who were specially trained to watch English classes. These observers sat in hundreds of hours of middle school classes and then spent countless more hours reviewing audio tapes and classifying teacher talk into categories, such as authentic questions. Then researchers employed a machine learning algorithm on the audiotape to figure out which speech patterns were typically associated with authentic questions and which weren’t. Finally, they used these speech patterns to build a computer model that keeps track of the proportion of questions that are authentic.

To check the accuracy of this computer model, the authors compared it to a traditional approach in which actual people listen to a recording of a teacher and identify the authentic questions by hand. The computer model and the hand-coded approach don’t produce identical results. Sometimes the computer labels something an authentic question that a human doesn’t, and vice versa.
On average, the computer estimated a 3.6 percent rate of authentic questions. Humans found slightly more, a 3.9 percent rate of authentic questions. Statistically speaking, the difference wasn’t significant. Deciding whether a question has a pre-ordained answer is a somewhat subjective endeavor. Even expert human observers disagree on how to categorize a question 20 percent of the time.
But even in this relatively successful experiment, the potential pitfalls of relying on AI for teacher observations are in evidence. Is a teacher with a higher authentic question count a better teacher? Kelly says he’s encountered fantastic teachers who don’t utter authentic questions at all or conduct whole group discussions. “They were more concerned with giving students close feedback on their writing,” he said.
Related: Researchers can predict when a student’s mind is wandering. What should we do about it?
Kelly said he wouldn’t want models like this used to penalize a teacher with a low-performance rating. A human observer would obviously give this writing teacher high marks. But Kelly argues that automated observation could give school leaders insight into whether students are getting enough lively, thoughtful discussions in their classes.  “If a student never gets any authentic questions and discussions, that’s probably not a good thing,” said Kelly. The average 50-minute middle school English class in America typically has less than two minutes of genuine discussion among several students and a teacher, Kelly said.
Kelly predicts that automated classroom observers will be a reality in the not-too-distant future. “The capability of the computer science is quite good,” he said. “With enough of an effort, we can get there pretty quickly. But if you proceed too fast, you’ll be out there with a tool that you don’t know what it’s doing. You need lots and lots of research to show that it’s valid and leading to useful teacher feedback.” Hopefully, decision makers will use automated observer robots to improve instruction and not as a weapon against teachers, repeating the mistakes made using student test scores to pay and punish teachers.

In so many areas, we now have mature solutions in place and, now and again, we hear about interesting and insightful applications of ML & AI towards hitherto unexplored problems that make us go “Oh, wow!”.As the deployed scenarios become richer and more widespread, we have to make sure that security and privacy aspects of AI & ML are adequately thought through. In order to do so, it is important to understand the different ways security and privacy cross paths with the fields of AI & ML. In this series, we will explore those intersections one ‘facet’ at a time with a goal to understand the nature and extent of risks involved and what protections are available or being explored for each.While I have several years of work experience in the information security and privacy space, I am relatively new to AI & ML. (We have just started using ML techniques in our cloud security and dev ops projects at work.) So this series is more from the viewpoint of a security person reasoning about security and privacy in the contexts of AI & ML in a systematic manner. The early parts of the series will focus on somewhat narrow technical aspects. However, over the course of the series, we will also cover the broader social/societal concerns. As the series develops, I would love to hear back from experts in both fields what they think about the way I have organized the presentation.In this first part, I will start with the “let us get the basics right” message from a cybersecurity standpoint without getting much into the internals of AI & ML . In the parts to follow, we will start looking closer (inside the box) at the AI & ML components.Traditional Cybersecurity of AI & ML SolutionsLike any new field, AI & ML bring a bunch of interesting artefacts, associated nuances and caveats with them that pose a challenge from a security standpoint.The two images below (from the Microsoft Azure documentation), show the typical artefacts and stakeholder groups involved at various stages of an end to end AI/ML workflow.The End-2-End Workflow — Lots of systems, data formats, tools, stakeholders, etc.The diaspora of development tools, platforms, frameworks, data handling, etc.Diagrams like these highlight the following characteristics of the nature and types of security challenges we are faced with:There is a huge ecosystem of (some old, some new) tools, languages, frameworks — with functions ranging from data ingestion, data pre-processing, modeling, model evaluation, integration, visualization, packaging & deployment, etc.Multiple stakeholders groups — ranging from traditional software engineers to machine learning engineers, data scientists and statisticians — are involved in any project.The complete working solution usually involves multiple systems coupled together at various interfaces.From a security standpoint, this is a lot of new and unknown things. We are looking at lots of new tools and frameworks, new people (stakeholder groups) and new systems or combinations of systems. Setting aside the specifics/internals of AI & ML for the moment, even just traditional cybersecurity tends to be hard to do well in such a context. This is because often new tools and frameworks take time to become ‘secure enough’, new stakeholder groups may not always have a uniform understanding or awareness of security and, thirdly, solutions involving many systems and interfaces have had a history of interesting security failures at the boundaries/interfaces.A Note about the ‘Data’ in Data ScienceNow let us look at the ‘data security’ side a bit. The following characteristics of data security challenges stand out in the context of AI & ML:In most solutions, huge (HUGE!) amounts of business data is involved. We are talking millions or even billions of records. And, depending upon the problem domain, these can have a tremendous amount of value (e.g., past transactions at a brokerage) or sensitivity (e.g., medical records from a chain of hospitals).Moreover, not only is huge volumes of data involved, the preference is to consider all attributes/aspects (dimensions) of data. This brings up interesting tension with ‘data minimization’ principles of privacy.Unlike traditional software engineering, typically one can’t use ‘dummy data’ for testing/pre-production stages in AI & ML. (The whole point is about ‘learning from data’!) So, at all points in the ecosystem, we are talking about various stakeholders and various systems handling precious real data. (E.g., the team of data scientists collaborating to develop a model have to get access to much of the same data during experimentation that you have painstakingly protected for years on production systems leading to business data getting onto systems it typically never did in the past.) The many iterations and requests for variety of data can disrupt any existing data governance you may have in place.Given that as a field AI & ML have ventured into all walks of life, we are looking at hundreds of hitherto obscure data and record formats (and corresponding readers, encoders and decoders). We have had a colorful history of security bugs just in the handful of the more popular encoding formats. Consider what lies ahead when we account for the multiplier effect.First Steps: Doing the Basics RightWhile they are indeed daunting, many of the above challenges should not be new for security practitioners. We have been through technology paradigm shifts in the past. We have seen how the foundational principles of good security do not change and how it is all about applying them after carefully understanding the nuances and unique requirements of any new context/ecosystem. At the end of the day, it should all boil down to doing the basics right — viz.,Ensure that all team members/stakeholders have a good basic understanding of security and privacy — things like data classification, data protection techniques, authentication/authorization, privacy principles, applicable regulatory requirements, etc. The goal should be to ensure that all stakeholders have role-appropriate understanding of security and privacy and everyone uses the same terminology and knows and understands relevant policy and standards.Have a good data governance structure is in place. Ownership and accountability should be clear for various stakeholders as data changes hands at different stages of each workflow. This is particularly important given the wide circulation of data that will be inevitable in ML & AI projects.Perform diligent threat modeling of solutions — both at component level and from an end to end perspective. This will ensure that security is ‘built in’ into the design and that applicable security requirements are met at every point in the end to end system (where valuable data is processed, stored or transmitted).When threat modeling, particular attention should be paid at boundaries and interfaces between the different sub-systems. Assumptions made by either side at those interfaces should be clearly documented and verified.Also, because production data is involved everywhere, be sure to exhaustively cover all workflows in the threat models— starting from the earliest experiments and proofs of concept to the fully operational system as it would be in deployed in production.Ensure that good programming practices are followed during implementation and, depending on the technologies used, appropriate vulnerabilities are mitigated (e.g., if some part of the solution is web-based, then the authentication token/cookies must be protected from attacks such as XSS, CSRF, etc.)Ensure that all threats/risks identified during threat modeling and considered important enough to address are actually fixed by performing a combination of feature security testing and penetration assessments.Make sure that native security models of different frameworks and sub-systems are adequately understood and rationalized to achieve uniform security across the system. This is particularly important because of the multiple, possibly disparate components and frameworks that will get ‘glued’ together to make up the end to end solution.Be careful about software components that are used by various stakeholders in different stages of the project or imported into the different ‘pipelines’. Use verified and signed components where possible and, where that is not an option, consider other factors such as developer reputation, extent of use, trustworthiness of the repository, comments and reviews, history of security issues/vulnerabilities, etc. These should help assess if the component may be good enough from a security quality perspective.Think about security of your deployment (CICD) pipeline. Do you have good control over who can change the build/release environment? Are you protecting any secrets/connection strings that are required for deployment adequately? Is your production setup locked down enough so that people cannot make ad hoc configuration changes?Exercise good monitoring and security hygiene. Make sure all software components are at their latest security patch level, conduct periodic access reviews, rotate keys/certificates, etc.Lastly, do have a good incident response plan in place so you can deal with a calamity if one does happen.Ok, so there we are! To a security professional, none of the above should sound new/novel. You must have done some or all of these in various problem contexts in the past. So this first aspect of security and privacy in AI & ML is much about applying all that expertise in a new context while partnering with all the stakeholders involved.But realize that we have approached the AI & ML components of the system as a ‘black box’ so far. Things start getting much more interesting when we look closer into that box. That is exactly what we will venture into in the next part of the series.

A 2018 research survey found that companies see competitors gearing up for big data and AI success — and that’s fueling their investment in similar capabilities.










After years of hope and promise, 2018 may be the year when artificial intelligence (AI) gains meaningful traction within Fortune 1000 companies. This is a key finding of NewVantage Partners’ annual executive survey, which finds that investment in big data and AI are increasing rapidly, though ROI remains elusive.
In this webinar, Randy Bean, CEO of NewVantage Partners and author of “How Big Data and AI Are Driving Business Innovation in 2018,” discusses the findings from the 2018 study of Fortune 1000 companies, gives examples, and shares his thoughts on the current and future states of big data and artificial intelligence implementation among leading business organizations.
In this webinar, you’ll learn:

Why gaps continue between what leaders say they are doing with big data and AI and what they are actually doing
Why big data and AI implementation can take far longer than companies anticipate
Why a combined short-term/long-term strategy for big data and AI is essential
How to “innovate around the edges” to achieve big data and AI success

Robots make food better
Making artificial intelligence about people 


                                                    Written by Jelle Steenbergen on Friday 27 July 2018                        

                    








 

Why robots won’t take your job, and how A.I. makes the food industry better at solving problems.
Whenever the subject of artificial intelligence or machine learning is broached, it’s not long before conversation turns towards automation. ‘Will robots take my job?’ is a pressing and increasingly real question on many people's minds. But while it’s true that the food industry is filled with tasks that could very well be done by automated machinery, the truly revolutionary A.I. applications are about people. They augment instead of automate.
 
If a human can’t do it, neither can a machine
One of the fundamental truths about artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the all-encompassing algorithms is that it’s only as good as the data it is given. This type of technology thrives on good data, but is rendered ultimately useless without it. Simply put: if a human can’t do it, neither can a machine. This crucial interplay between man and machine is something that is often overlooked, but nevertheless vital to understand. We control what machines learn, and as a result we have the power to make A.I. about people.
 
Addressing a real human need
A.I., then, is about helping people. About addressing real needs and real problems in the areas A.I. excels at. These are three questions that show the strengths of artificial intelligence applications:


What is this?


Are these the same or different?


What happens next?


The first two questions have immediate and far-reaching implications for the food space. In the area of food waste, for example. using image recognition (what’s this?) and quick-fire categorization (are these the same?) is by far the most effective solution for measuring and mapping the sheer scale of the problem. A.I. can be used to determine where along the food chain waste happens, which products are the most vulnerable to waste, and how much food gets wasted. It’s a way of making sense of the images and numbers, and the data then gets passed back to humans, who are able to determine the best course of action to prevent the most amount of food waste. The algorithms augment human ability by helping us understand.

 
Fighting crop disease one seedling at a time
The agricultural sector, too, gets a great deal of mileage out of answers to these three questions. Fighting crop disease is a good example here. By feeding the machine with images portraying the visual symptoms of disease (what is this?), the A.I. can quickly determine whether or not a plant is diseased (are these the same?). Because it can virtually instantly determine this, it is feasible for farmers to select and remove individual blighted crops, thereby preserving most of the hale harvest.
 
Take a self-driving car to the burgerbot
The last question (what’s next?) is rather more complicated. Examples from outside the food industry are easier to find. Predictive power forms the core of self-driving cars, for example. Cutting edge video and photo editing programs also use it to enhance images or fill in blank spaces based. Within the food space, the most interesting example of predictive power, and A.I. in general is the newly minted Creator hamburger machine in San Francisco.

The benefits of automation
Creator (formerly known as momentum machines) is the result of nine years of development. It is a fully automated hamburger machine able to churn out 400 custom made hamburgers an hour without any human interaction. This is the dreaded robot come to take our jobs, then. Yet in many ways Creator is a shining example of augmentation, too. A nearly 15 foot contraption made up of 350 sensors, 50 actuators, and 20 computers, Creator uses the predictive power of A.I. to create perfect burgers, customizable to a degree that humans cannot accomplish. How much ketchup do you want on your burger, in milliliters please? How long would you like it cooked, down to the second or less?
 
Better ingredients and better jobs
By automating the food preparation process Creator is able to do two revolutionary things. The first is that it can source top quality ingredients while maintaining a very accessible price point ($6 per burger). The beef for the burger only gets ground once an order is placed. The vegetables are organic and locally grown. The sauces are homemade fresh every day. In any other restaurant the price would easily be double what Creator is asking. Making high quality, sustainable food available to a wider audience is certainly a good thing.
The second thing Creator does is it doesn’t replace staff, but rather allows them to focus on hospitality, interaction, and personal growth. The machine allows for people to do what people do best, instead of flipping burgers the staff is able to provide guests with a memorable hospitality experience. The staff is paid $16 an hour and given 5% of their time to work on their personal long term goals.
The robot didn’t take their job, it made their job better.
 
A tool like any other
Artificial Intelligence isn’t a looming presence threatening to disrupt the economy and put people out of jobs. It’s a tool like any other. A tool we control and direct as we see fit. Making A.I. about people is about applying the tool to problems that address a real human need. The machine can’t think for itself. They’re only as good as the people behind it. As long as we use it right, A.I. can make our lives better. It’s not up to the machine. It’s up to us.

Home  Industry  Technology UAE, India to partner on artificial intelligence, aim to generate $20bn in benefits
A joint working committee will seek to to increase investment in AI startups and research activities

The UAE has signed a partnership with India to develop artificial intelligence (AI) with plans to generate an $20bn in economic benefits during the next decade. 
The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the India – UAE Artificial Intelligence Bridge will “spur discussion and explore options for both countries to grow their AI economies”, a statement said. 
AI is expected to maximise the efficiency and delivery of government services while also boosting the effectiveness of the private sector.
The UAE-India collaboration will seek to evaluate the dynamic nature of AI by convening a joint working committee between the UAE Ministry for Artificial Intelligence, Invest India and Startup India.
The committee will meet once a year with the mandate to increase investment in AI startups and research activities in partnership with the private sector.
The collaboration will broadly focus on three main areas, the statement added. They include – 
– Open Engagement: The working committee will monitor the landscape of AI to identify emerging trends and policy concerns. This will help develop “mutually favourable regulatory frameworks and policies without being outpaced by the speed of technological developments”, the statement said. 
There is potential to work together with governments, technology startups, academia and industry associations to understand how technology is evolving, what it means for the private and public sector, and how its adoption can be accelerated.
– Foster Innovative Ecosystems: Creating an enabling environment requires all concerned stakeholders to invest in AI. Initially this will entail creating AI regulatory sandboxes and the sharing of regulatory expertise to facilitate the entry of AI startups into each other’s jurisdiction. 
“Once the environment is set, the tools will be made available and that will come in the form of sharing datasets to enhance development and innovation of AI startups,” the statement said. 
– Looking to The Future: The collaboration will help both parties play a catalytic role in the development and adoption of breakthrough technologies. Research and development and investment in new technologies, tools and solutions in a controlled regulatory sandbox environment will be facilitated. This will allow stakeholders to engage and understand transformative tech. 
Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai said: “Artificial Intelligence will lead human development in the coming years. The UAE and India will be at the forefront of the change to come.”
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi added that the Indian government is launching multiple initiatives through which the potential of AI can be realised in the areas of agriculture supply, healthcare and disaster management services. 
“The road ahead for artificial intelligence depends on and will be driven by human intentions,” he added.
