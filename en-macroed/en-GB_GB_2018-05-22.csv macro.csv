 Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) in recent months, combined with increasing volumes of data and falling technology costs, are radically transforming the world of business. A survey conducted by EY with Forbes Insights shows 66 per cent of global companies are investing upwards of £4 million in analytics software and 78 per cent agree that analytics are changing the nature of competitive advantage. Leading companies reported a significant shift in their ability to meet competitive challenges by using data.
The impact of AI on finance functions is well documented, but its ability to unlock value in today’s tax function less so. Nevertheless, its impacts can be just as dramatic. Machine-learning software, a form of AI, can read thousands of lines of business transactions and instantly assess whether an item of expenditure is tax deductible. Where once armies of tax accountants trawled through corporate accounts to work out tax liabilities, a single machine can do this work in seconds with improved accuracy and consistency.
Notwithstanding the impressive results of putting AI to work in tax, the businesses in our survey said they encourage data analysis to be carried out by someone who knows the organisation and is familiar with the business objectives. This highlights the importance of human oversight of AI processes and data analytics.
As a result, the introduction of AI is triggering a rethink of the responsibilities of the tax function and, by extension, those of finance departments in businesses. It is also fundamentally changing the role of the tax professional, freeing them from repetitive tasks to concentrate on higher-end strategic business partnering.
“Accounting and compliance work will be changed irrevocably by adopting these technologies,” says Charles Brayne, chief tax innovation officer at EY. “In common with other global organisations, we are going through a process of looking at our business and asking how we can apply machine-learning and AI in different areas. I foresee accounting compliance and diligence work, risk management and tax review being almost entirely automated, data driven or machine driven.”
As an example, tax compliance (be that corporate tax, VAT or employment taxes) for a business involves going through lists of hundreds of thousands of items of expenditure, from marketing costs to travel expenses, then deciding which items to tax effect. This is a huge volume of work for tax professionals to carry out. It requires deep knowledge of tax law and the ability to make informed judgments. The process is open to error given the sheer complexity and repetitive nature of the work.
Search tools and rule-based systems can speed up the process. If a description of a transaction contains a certain keyword, for example, it is automatically assigned to a tax category. However, it is impossible to capture the full complexities of tax law by simply setting up such a system.
This is where machine-learning approaches, such as text classification, are reshaping tax practice and is the basis of a new tool we have created at EY called the Automated Ledger Review Tool, or ALeRT. It is a machine-learning system that infers tax rules from data with which it is presented rather than being explicitly taught them.

ALeRT offers great opportunities for directing tax professionals to where their judgement is most needed

ALeRT is first shown “training data” from which it learns how the descriptions of transactions relate to tax treatment. It is language and alphabet agnostic, but it is data that has already been labelled or categorised by a human. For example, it could be a previous year’s accounts, where each transaction, such as an item of marketing expenditure or a travel expense, is marked up as being tax deductible or not. The machine figures out which features or words in the description help it to discriminate between the different categories. When it has observed certain patterns of words many times and in each case the answer was always “deductible”, it learns that whenever it sees a similar combination of words and letters, the answer should again be “tax deductible”.
Training is a vital stage in creating a machine-learning system. Before letting ALeRT loose on live corporate data, its accuracy, along with other key performance metrics, are validated against other training data. This is another essential feature of ALeRT; it states the confidence it has in every one of its conclusions and whether or not it is confused. Scrutinising these outputs is where the human mind and the tax professional’s craft are brought back into the process, and where true business advantage lies.
ALeRT offers great opportunities for directing tax professionals to where their judgment is most needed,  as there may be just 200 out of 10,000 that merit a human review. Our experience of using ALeRT suggests that to create value from big data, you need to analyse, review and act on data findings intelligently, not apply them blindly.

A further benefit of AI and machine-learning lies in its accuracy. The machine is deterministic, so when it sees a description and gives a category, it replicates this exactly for each example. Humans are not so consistent, so there is a greatly improved consistency of output. The risk associated with transaction analysis therefore goes down as a result of using this technology. This can save businesses money as they often err on the side of caution and miss out on full tax reliefs due to their complexity.
According to Harvey Lewis, chief data scientist for tax, technology and transformation at EY, the growing use of AI and machine-learning means tax professionals will require a broader set of skills. “They will need their tax training and expertise, but they will also need other skills. They’ll have to understand how the software works and they will need to develop the art of storytelling and giving insights to clients about the data. The upshot of AI is that their skillsets will start to expand rather than contract. Businesses are realising that success in AI depends on a strong focus on people,” says Dr Lewis.
EY is looking at greater use of AI in future, for instance it is prototyping a chatbot that can answer questions about taxation from clients. Tax accounting will undergo huge changes over coming years with the application of AI. This will bring broad benefits to clients, to consultancies and to the accountants themselves.

What is artificial intelligence?
Artificial intelligence mimics certain operations of the human mind and is the term used when machines are able to complete tasks that typically require human intelligence. The term machine learning is when computers use rules (algorithms) to analyze data and learn patterns and glean insights from the data. Artificial intelligence is a large factor shifting the way legal work is done.
Review documents and legal research
AI-powered software improves the efficiency of document analysis for legal use and machines can review documents and flag them as relevant to a particular case. Once a certain type of document is denoted as relevant, machine learning algorithms can get to work to find other documents that are similarly relevant. Machines are much faster at sorting through documents than humans and can produce output and results that can be statistically validated. They can help reduce the load on the human workforce by forwarding on only documents that are questionable rather than requiring humans to review all documents. It’s important that legal research is done in a timely and comprehensive manner, even though it’s monotonous. AI systems such as the one offered by ROSS Intelligence leverages natural language processing to help analyze documents.
PROMOTED
Help perform due diligence
In law offices around the world, legal support professionals are kept busy conducting due diligence to uncover background information on behalf of their clients. This works includes confirming facts and figures and thoroughly evaluating the decisions on prior cases to effectively provide counsel to their clients. Artificial intelligence tools can help these legal support professionals to conduct their due diligence more efficiently and with more accuracy since this work is often tedious for humans.

Contract review and management
A big portion of work law firms do on behalf of clients is to review contracts to identify risks and issues with how contracts are written that could have negative impacts for their clients. They redline items, edit contracts and counsel clients if they should sign or not or help them negotiate better terms. AI can help analyze contracts in bulk as well as individual contracts. There are several software companies who created AI tools specifically for contract review such as Kira Systems, LawGeex and eBrevia that help sort contracts quicker and with fewer errors than humans.
Predict legal outcomes
AI has the capability of analyzing data to help it make predictions about the outcomes of legal proceedings better than humans. Clients are often asking their legal counsel to predict the future with questions such as “If we go to trial, how likely will it be that I win?” or “Should I settle?” With the use of AI that has access to years of trial data, lawyers are able to better answer such questions.

Automating divorce
A typical divorce settlement can take a year or more and can cost $27,000 on average in the United States. With a goal of “making every divorce amicable,” Wevorce provides couples a self-guided online divorce solution for a fraction of the cost. Couples can define their “optimal outcomes” and the AI-powered machine walks them through five modules and all the critical decisions that need to be made for their particular circumstances. There are also legal experts available to step in to provide guidance when needed.
How will AI impact the legal profession?
According to Deloitte, 100,000 legal roles will be automated by 2036. They report that by 2020 law firms will be faced with a “tipping point” for a new talent strategy.  Now is the time for all law firms to commit to becoming AI-ready by embracing a growth mindset, set aside the fear of failure and begin to develop internal AI practices. There are many who believe innovation is the key to transforming the legal profession. That’s precisely what NextLaw Labs, “the first legal technology venture created by a law firm,” plans to do.
It’s clear that AI and machine learning are already transforming law firms and the legal sector.

Grantees of Microsoft’s AI for Earth, a program aimed at helping groups address complex environmental problems, met at Microsoft headquarters recently to learn new ways to apply artificial intelligence and cloud computing to their respective projects.The program awards grants of access to and training in the company’s cloud-based data storage, management, and analysis to address challenges in four thematic areas: addressing climate change, protecting biodiversity, improving agricultural yields, and lessening water scarcity.Grant recipients include teams working on game theory to predict poaching patterns; mining social media photos to determine distributions of particular species; and using machine learning and animals’ acoustic activity to determine effectiveness of conservation interventions. New technologies are generating far more information than ever before to help scientists assess and predict the health and behavior of species and ecosystems, as well as the threats they face.
These include cryptic cameras, acoustic sensors, satellite imagery and citizen science apps. Now, researchers and conservation practitioners analyzing large data sets are exploring artificial intelligence, or AI—the ability of a machine or a computer program to think and learn—to help them process, analyze and interpret data to monitor ecosystems and predict results.
Computer systems already exist that can host huge amounts of data, use AI with increasingly “smart” algorithms to classify data from the various types of sensors used by scientists, apply modeling results to create reproducible code, and create user interfaces to allow people to monitor natural systems and make predictions with high accuracy.
By training computer algorithms with a subset of available data, machines can now learn what they should do for a given challenge—such as classify photos by the species found in them, identify areas of a satellite image containing water or intact forest, or translate speech from one language to another­—based on human feedback and data collected from previous experience.

The applications for AI in conservation science are myriad: Fei Fang, an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pennsylvania, leads a group applying game theory and machine learning to optimize patrol routes to catch poachers. At Wild Me, a nonprofit based in Portland, Oregon, director Jason Holmberg’s team applies AI-infused computer vision to identify individual animals of endangered species while reducing fieldwork and image processing time, under the Wildbook open-source project. And at Santa Cruz, California-based  Conservation Metrics, chief executive Matthew McKown and his team are using AI and remote-sensing to automate wildlife surveys and machine learning to classify animals’ acoustic activity.
Cloud-based machine learning
A panel moderated by Mongabay founder Rhett Butler at the AI for Earth meeting at Microsoft headquarters in Seattle, Washington highlighted the work of Fang, Holmberg and McKown. The meeting, from May 16 to 18, gathered some 40 researchers, engineers and conservation professionals from over 25 institutions to network and improve their capacity to apply AI tools to specific conservation challenges.
The participants were all recipients of seed grants from Microsoft’s AI for Earth program. The grants provide between $5,000 and $15,000 worth of access to various resources on Microsoft’s Azure cloud-based computing platform. These include data, data storage, and tools for modeling, predictive analytics, machine learning, spatial analysis, and visualization, as well as training on using the various tools.

Over the two-day meeting, the grantees attended classroom sessions to learn about cloud-based machine learning tools on the Azure platform. Topics included modeling with AI, cognitive services (e.g. vision or speech), deep learning, project management, and data visualization.  The meeting also introduced the Microsoft R Workflows tool that combines AI and the R statistical analysis tool, and the GeoAI tool that integrates AI with a geographic information system (GIS) to perform and automate spatial analyses, conduct predictive analytics, and integrate statistical and location information.
The AI for Earth grantee projects aim to classify images to map the distribution of species, vegetation types or spread of disease; predict extreme weather events, snow pack or crop cover; and assess risks or impact from climate change, geophysical hazards or wildlife poachers in a given area.
‘You know the problem you’re trying to solve’
Since its launch in December 2017, the AI for Earth program has provided assistance to more than 110 individuals and organizations in 27 countries working to address complex environmental and conservation challenges. Grantees include students, universities, private nonprofit organizations, government agencies, land trusts, and other groups.
It continues to accept applicants on a rolling basis, reviewing applications from around the world several times each year.
These collaborations earn Microsoft both positive publicity and new customers in the environmental sector, and grantees welcome the potential gains that AI-related technologies can bring to conservation science.
Fang and her students at Carnegie Mellon, for instance, expect that machine learning tools and game theory will help them more accurately and efficiently predict where wildlife poaching will happen next. Holmberg wants to speed up the Wildbook project’s processing of images, where AI can automate the scanning of social media sites for photographs of a particular species. Algorithms help identify each individual animal, together with where and how often it’s photographed, and suggest new ways to produce global population estimates for endangered species.
Although albatrosses, like this Laysan albatross, spend most of their time at sea, they nest on open, grassy or sandy expanses of islands. Rats, cats, dogs, and other introduced predators kill nesting birds and chicks, so scientists are analyzing acoustic data with AI to study how populations of these birds respond to eradication of these invasive species.

At Conservation Metrics, McKown wants to understand impacts of conservation actions, such as excluding domestic animals from islands, on seabirds and grassland nesting habitat. He and his team are beginning to use AI to help analyze acoustic activity data see if such actions actually help restore wild animal populations.
AI for Earth awards grants in four broad thematic areas: addressing climate change, protecting biodiversity, improving agricultural yields, and lessening water scarcity. It particularly seeks projects focusing on a question that lends itself to an AI answer.
“At this stage in our program, we’re trying to cast a very broad net,” said Josh Henretig, senior director and co-lead of AI for Earth. “There are a range of different technology solutions out there.”
AI for Earth can be most helpful to groups that have defined the problem they want to solve and have validated the problem with research or a target community to identify, and ideally gather, the data they need to solve it, Henretig said.
“Ultimately,” he said, “through our grant program … we’re starting with the premise that you’ve done that background work, you know the problem that you’re trying to solve, so let’s start with an initial investment in Azure infrastructure that you can begin to shape some part of the project that you’re trying to drive forward.”

Grantees at last week’s meeting were familiar with AI or machine learning but had a range of experience with the Azure platform. Lucas Joppa, Microsoft’s chief environmental scientist and AI for Earth’s other co-lead, said the initial grants of access to cloud infrastructure, AI software, and services in the Azure cloud were intended “to get people up and running to address issues with machine learning.”
“We do have fairly introductory-level content for people,” Henretig said, “like how to access and set up your Azure account, how to organize resources on that Azure account, [so] you know how to get started.”
Researchers can apply for AI for Earth support online here. Grant applications should include a proposal that describes the environmental problem or challenge being addressed, the datasets used for analysis, proposed methods to solve the problem, and the expected impact the project will have on the issue. Henretig said his team had a particular interest in supporting innovative water and agriculture projects, though they welcome proposals for projects in all four thematic categories.

When pundits talk about the impact that artificial intelligence (AI) will have on the labor market, the outlook is usually bleak, with the loss of many jobs to machines as the dominant theme. But that’s just part of the story — a probable outcome for companies that use AI only to increase efficiency. As it turns out, companies using AI to also drive innovation are more likely to increase head count than reduce it.
That’s what my colleagues and I recently learned through the McKinsey Global Institute’s broad-based research initiative aimed at understanding the spread of AI in economies, sectors, and companies.1 We polled 20,000 AI-aware C-level executives in 10 countries to compile a sample of more than 3,000 companies (mostly large), identified distinct clusters within that pool, and ran a variety of scenarios on those clusters to project the effects of AI on employment, revenue, and profitability.
This research and analysis suggest that although AI will probably lead to less overall full-time-equivalent employment by 2030, it won’t inevitably lead to massive unemployment. One major reason for this prediction is because early, innovation-focused adopters are positioning themselves for growth, which tends to stimulate employment. (See “How AI-Based Innovations Drive Employment.”)



How AI-Based Innovations Drive Employment
Growth is a key part of the equation between the performance and employment shifts we’ll see from now through 2030 for five types of companies.









Here’s how we expect things to play out in the five clusters of companies we examined.
Enthusiastic innovators, or pioneering companies that make early investments in AI and embrace the disruption it can create in the quest for advantage, adopt a full range of AI technologies and use them to bolster innovation and efficiency. These companies are analogous to what sociologist and communication theorist Everett Rogers called “early adopters” back when he coined the term — they’re intrinsically motivated to use new technology to shape and open markets.2 While this approach is potentially complex in the short term, our analysis shows that by 2030, the profitability of enthusiastic innovators will grow 8% faster than that of the average company on an annual basis, their revenue will grow 4% faster, and their head count will rise 2.2% faster.

From the May 2018 Issue.
One of the hot areas of emerging technology is Artificial Intelligence or AI. You know a topic is hot when products use the terminology in their name or in their marketing materials. We’ve see this done with “ease of use”, Cloud Computing, and Blockchain. Artificial Intelligence is so hot of a topic among the development community that the marketing teams are saying products have AI when in fact, they do not. Because of this, I’ve been using the approach of calling this “artificial” Artificial Intelligence or “Fake” AI. Facts matter, and many products that claim to have AI simply do not. It is truly buyer beware right now in this area.
As a computer scientist by training, I admire products that have developed solutions that leverage AI. Program development in this area is not easy, and the products are just starting to work and do meaningful tasks. Some of the goals of AI are quite lofty, and the promises and risks of AI in computing are quite large. Consider the following:


On the positive side:

Machines mimic cognitive functions associated with human minds such as learning and problem solving.
As AI becomes more capable, tasks that were considered AI are considered solved, for example, OCR.
Today, AI developments include human speech, autonomous cars, interpreting complex data like images and video.
Algorithms can learn from data and provide insight and actionable items with minimal human intervention.

On the down side:

For difficult problems, algorithms require enormous computation.
“The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race. Once humans develop artificial intelligence, it will take off on its own and redesign itself at an ever-increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn’t compete and would be superseded.” Stephen Hawking. Other critics include: Bill Gates, Elon Musk, and Peter Thiel.
Devaluation of humanity.
Decrease in demand for human labor.
Artificial moral agents.
Machine ethics.
Malevolent and friendly AI.
Machine consciousness.
Robot rights.
Superintelligence.

AI has been under development for a long time, starting at Dartmouth in 1956. I was using LISP in 1975 and this tool was broadly used until 1987, when it was replaced by SmallTalk/Medley. AI is routinely divided into sub-fields such as robotics (a future topic of this why and how series of columns) or machine learning (third in the series) although we are treating these emerging technologies separately in the why and how series of articles. Traditional goals include: reasoning, knowledge, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and explainability. Tools include versions of search and mathematical optimization, neural networks and methods based on statistics, probability and economics. Stuart Shapiro divides AI research into three traditions, which he calls computational psychology, computational philosophy, and computer science. Together the human-like behavior, mind and actions make up AI.
We’ve seen the results of AI with public relations stunts when:

Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov on May 11, 1997.
In a February 2011 Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM‘s question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin.
At the 2017 Future of Go Summit, AlphaGo won a three-game match with Ke Jie, who at the time continuously held the world No. 1 ranking for two years.

Why?
AI is a broad collection of topics and approaches. Because there are so many topics to cover, there are broad fields of study that each have a lot of depth. However, purists are after the last bullet in the list below, General Intelligence. This is not around the corner, as computer scientists of the 1950’s believed, but a decade or more into the future, even with the rapid progress being made today. There are a number of problems AI is trying to solve:

Reasoning – AI has progressed using “sub-symbolic” problem solving statistical approaches to AI mimic the human ability to guess faster and more accurately.
Knowledge representation – a representation of “what exists” is an ontology: the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties formally described so that software agents can interpret them.
Planning – intelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them, modifying inputs as needed.
Learning – the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.
Natural language processing – the ability to read and understand human language.
Perception – the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, tactile sensors, sonar and others) to deduce aspects of the world – think digital exhaust and IOT.
Motion and manipulation – robots need to handle tasks such as object manipulation and navigation, with sub-problems such as localization, mapping, and motion planning.
Social intelligence – affective computing is the study and development of systems that can recognize, interpret, process, and simulate human affects (=emotions), needed for two reasons:

o   being able to predict the actions of others, such as in self-driving vehicles.
o   facilitate human–computer interaction by showing emotions.

Creativity – theoretical and/or practical generation of novel and useful outputs including music and art.
General intelligence – researchers think that their work will eventually be incorporated into a machine with artificial general intelligence, while a few believe that anthropomorphic features like artificial consciousness or an artificial brain may be required for such a project.

So how do Artificial Intelligence approaches work? They use:

Cybernetics and brain stimulation – connection to neurology .
Traditional symbolic AI – John Haugeland named these approaches to AI “good old fashioned AI” or “GOFAI“ exploring the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation.
Cognitive simulation – Economist Herbert Simon and Allen Newell studied human problem-solving skills from psychological experiments resulting in the Soar architecture in the 1980’s.
Logic-based – John McCarthy in his laboratory at Stanford (SAIL) used formal logic and led to the Prolog language and the science of logic programming.
Anti-logic or scruffy – Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert found that solving difficult problems in vision and natural language processing required ad-hoc solutions.
Knowledge-based – led to the development in the 1970’s of expert systems, introduced by Edward Feigenbaum of Stanford.
Sub-symbolic – when traditional symbolic AI stalled in the 1980’s unable to solve problems in perception, robotics, learning and pattern recognition, researchers tried to not encode knowledge.
Embodied intelligence – Researchers of robotics, such as Rodney Brooks, reintroduced the use of control theory and embodied mind.
Computational intelligence – neural networks and “connectionism” was revived by David Rumelhart leading to soft computing approaches including fuzzy systems, evolutionary computation and statistical tools.
Statistical methods – sophisticated mathematical tools to solve specific subproblems that are truly scientific, in the sense that their results are both measurable and verifiable.
Intelligent agent – a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success.

With input from the customer and collaboration between artificial intelligence (AI) and human stylists, the online styling subscription service eliminates the need for their customers to go out and shop for clothing or even browse online, because they deliver personalized recommendations right to their door on a regular schedule. The customers can keep all of the products or return what they don’t like or need. That feedback gets input into the company’s data vaults to make the algorithms even better at determining the preferred style for each person and even identify trends.

In 2017, the company had $1 billion in revenue and 2.2 million active customers, but competitors such as Amazon and Trunk Club are lining up to mimic its style of retail. Here are just a few of the most intriguing ways Stitch Fix uses artificial intelligence in combination with human stylists to propel its business.
Personalization of clothing and accessories
Stitch Fix has combined the expertise of personal stylists with the insight and efficiency of artificial intelligence to analyze data on style trends, body measurements, customer feedback and preferences to arm the human stylists with a culled down version of possible recommendations. This helps the company provide its customers with personalized style recommendations that fit their lifestyle and budgets.

Improve satisfaction rate and lower return rate

The better the Stitch Fix stylists—human and machines—are at providing their customers with products they will love, the better their business runs. As they invest in merchandise they know their customers will love, the less they waste on warehouse space, return costs and donating items that weren’t sold. As Eric Colson, chief algorithm officer at Stitch Fix, said, “Our business is getting relevant things into the hands of our customers.”
Develop new styles
Back in 2012, Stitch Fix had one machine learning algorithm, today they have hundreds. Using the data it collects, the company is designing its own styles known as Hybrid Designs. They think of each style as a collection of attributes such as color, arm length and neckline. Then, they look at the feedback that’s available for each of these attributes. By recombining attributes and even mutating them slightly, Stitch Fix is able to create new designs to share with its human designers to vet the final styles that make it into their inventory. Then, the styling algorithm will get the new products into the hands of customers and when they share their feedback, the cycle of evolution continues.

Know the client
Stitch Fix not only asks customers to fill out a style profile to determine style, size and prize preferences but records every touch point it has with clients and considers the “state” of each customer at any given time (starting a new job, have a special event, going through a life transition such as divorce). As the algorithms identify a shift in “state,” it can help deliver the most relevant items and ultimately provide info to inform system level impacts.
Streamline operations
Artificial intelligence is at work through all aspects of the warehouse and delivery system of Stitch Fix. When a shipment is requested, an algorithm determines and assigns it to a warehouse based on the location of the client and the inventory of the warehouse and its match to a customer’s style among other considerations. Once items are selected for shipment, algorithms optimize the pick route to fill the box and look at possible combinations that would allow shipments to be picked at the same time.
Inventory management
Stitch Fix is just as concerned with inventory management as traditional brick-and-mortar stores. As clients receive and keep merchandise, they need to restock their inventory to give stylists a large enough inventory to meet demand. They need to figure out how many of each style to purchase so that it meets demand, but there’s no extras they can’t sell. The company uses algorithms to help optimize these and other complex inventory management issues.
While it may have been easier to outline the ways algorithms aren’t used by Stitch Fix, one thing is certain, the company has shown how collaboration between AI machines and humans with both doing what they do best is good business. Even with AI involved, humans are essential in the process, but when they work together the results are supercharged productivity and effectiveness.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",BreadcrumbList,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/05/25/stitch-fix-the-amazing-use-case-of-using-artificial-intelligence-in-fashion-retail/,"{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'Forbes', 'url': 'https://www.forbes.com/', 'ethicsPolicy': 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesstaff/article/forbes-editorial-values-and-standards/', 'logo': 'https://imageio.forbes.com/i-forbesimg/media/amp/images/forbes-logo-dark.png?format=png&height=455&width=650&fit=bounds'}",,2018-05-25T00:28:00-04:00,,2019-05-13T05:27:17-04:00,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://imageio.forbes.com/blogs-images/bernardmarr/files/2018/05/AdobeStock_205858205-1200x717.jpeg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds', 'width': 542.79, 'height': 304.6}","{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Bernard Marr', 'url': 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/', 'description': 'Bernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is Changing Business and Society.

The field of Artificial Intelligence powered by Machine Learning and Deep Learning has gone through some phenomenal changes over the last decade. Starting off as just a pure academic and research-oriented domain, we have seen widespread industry adoption across diverse domains including retail, technology, healthcare, science and many more. Rather than just running lab experiments to publish a research paper, the key objective of data science and machine learning in the 21st century has changed to tackling and solving real-world problems, automating complex tasks and making our life easier and better. More than often, the standard toolbox of machine learning, statistical or deep learning models remain the same. New models do come into existence like Capsule Networks, but industry adoption of the same usually takes several years. Hence, in the industry, the main focus of data science or machine learning is more ‘applied’ rather than theoretical and effective application of these models on the right data to solve complex real-world problems is of paramount importance.A machine learning model by itself consists of an algorithm which tries to learn latent patterns and relationships from data without hard-coding fixed rules. Hence, explaining how a model works to the business always poses its own set of challenges. There are some domains in the industry especially in the world of finance like insurance or banking where data scientists often end up having to use more traditional machine learning models (linear or tree-based). The reason being that model interpretability is very important for the business to explain each and every decision being taken by the model. However, this often leads to a sacrifice in performance. This is where complex models like ensembles and neural networks typically give us better and more accurate performance (since true relationships are rarely linear in nature). We, however, end up being unable to have proper interpretations for model decisions. To address and talk about these gaps, I will be writing a series of articles where we will explore some of these challenges in-depth about explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and human interpretable machine learning.Outline for this SeriesSome of the major areas we will be covering in this series of articles include the following.Part 1: The Importance of Human Interpretable Machine LearningUnderstanding Machine Learning Model InterpretationImportance of Machine Learning Model InterpretationCriteria for Model Interpretation MethodsScope of Model InterpretationPart 2: Model Interpretation StrategiesTraditional Techniques for Model InterpretationChallenges and Limitations of Traditional TechniquesThe Accuracy vs. Interpretability trade-offModel Interpretation TechniquesPart 3: Hands-on Model Interpretation — A comprehensive GuideHands-on guides on using the latest state-of-the-art model interpretation frameworksFeatures, concepts and examples of using frameworks like ELI5, Skater and SHAPExplore concepts and see them in action — Feature importances, partial dependence plots, surrogate models, interpretation and explanations with LIME, SHAP valuesHands-on Machine Learning Model Interpretation on a supervised learning examplePart 4: Hands-on Advanced Model InterpretationHands-on Model Interpretation on Unstructured DatasetsAdvanced Model Interpretation on Deep Learning ModelsThis content will be covered across several articles in this series as highlighted above to keep things concise and interesting, so that everyone can get some key takeaways from every article.MotivationWorking as a Data Scientist in the industry and mentoring people in the field, I have seen that data science is still often perceived as a black box capable of performing magic or alchemy to give people what they want. However, the harsh reality is that without a reasonable understanding of how machine learning models or the data science pipeline works, real-world projects rarely succeed. Considering any data science project in the real world, you will typically have a business aspect and the technical or solution aspect. Now, data scientists typically work to build models and provide solutions for the business. However, the business may not know the intricate details of how a model might work. But since this very model will be making a lot of decisions for them in the end, they do have a right to pose the question, “How can I trust your model?” or “How does your model really make its decisions?” Answering these questions is something data science practitioners and researchers have been trying over several years now.Data Science practitioners will know that there exists a typical model interpretability vs. model performance trade-off. A point to remember here is that model performance is not the run-time or execution performance, but how accurate the model can be in making decisions. There are several models including simple linear models or even tree-based models, which can easily explain the decisions taken by the model to arrive at a particular insight or prediction, but you might need to sacrifice model performance since they always do not yield the best results due to inherent problems of high bias (linear models) or high variance, leading to overfitting (fully grown tree models). More complex models like ensemble models and the more recent deep learning family of models often yield better performance, but are perceived as black-box models, because it is extremely difficult to explain how the model might be really making its decisions under the hood.While some might argue that if something is working well (for the time being), why question how it works? However, being humans, logic and reasoning is something we adhere to for most of our decisions. Hence, the paradigm shift towards artificial intelligence (AI) making decisions will no doubt be questioned. There are a lot of real-world scenarios where biased models might have really adverse effects. This includes predicting potential criminals, judicial sentencing risk scores, credit scoring, fraud detection, health assessment, loan lending, self-driving and many more where model understanding and interpretation is of utmost importance. The same is highlighted by renowned Data Scientist and Author Cathy O’ Neil in her acclaimed book, ‘Weapons of Math Destruction’.MainWeapons of Math Destruction has been Longlisted for the National Book Award! Book description: A former Wall Street…weaponsofmathdestructionbook.comRenowned researcher and author, Kate Crawford, talked about these very aspects of the implications of bias in machine learning and it’s effects on society in the NIPS 2017 Keynote, ‘The Trouble with Bias’.Interested readers should also definitely check out her famous article on the NY Times, ‘Artificial Intelligence’s White Guy Problem’ where she shows us examples of machine learning applications including image categorization, criminal risk predictions, delivery service availability and many more were biased and yielded unfavorable outcomes for the black community. All these real-world scenarios are implications of how important model interpretation should be, and if we want to leverage machine learning to solve these problems.Opinion | Artificial Intelligence's White Guy ProblemACCORDING to some prominent voices in the tech world, artificial intelligence presents a looming existential threat to…www.nytimes.comIn the past year, I have seen the need for model interpretation while solving problems in the industry and also when I was writing my recent book ‘Practical Machine Learning with Python’. During this time, I have had the chance to interact with the wonderful folks at DataScience.com who are very much aware of the need and importance of human interpretability in machine learning models. They have been actively working on a solution and have open-sourced the popular python framework, Skater. We will be taking a deep-dive into Skater and also do some hands-on model interpretation in this series of articles. Besides this we will also do a comprehensive coverage of other model interpretation frameworks like ELI5 and SHAP!Understanding Machine Learning Model InterpretationMachine Learning has seen widespread industry adoption only in the last couple of years. Hence, model interpretation as a concept is still mostly theoretical and subjective.Any machine learning model at its heart has a response function which tries to map and explain relationships and patterns between the independent (input) variables and the dependent (target or response) variable(s).When a model predicts or finds our insights, it takes certain decisions and choices. Model interpretation tries to understand and explain these decisions taken by the response function i.e., the what, why and how. The key to model interpretation is transparency, the ability to question, and the ease of understanding model decisions by humans. The three most important aspects of model interpretation are explained as follows.What drives model predictions? We should have the ability to query our model and find out latent feature interactions to get an idea of which features might be important in the decision-making policies of the model. This ensures fairness of the model.Why did the model take a certain decision? We should also be able to validate and justify why certain key features were responsible in driving certain decisions taken by a model during predictions. This ensures accountability and reliability of the model.How can we trust model predictions? We should be able to evaluate and validate any data point and how a model takes decisions on it. This should be demonstrable and easy to understand for key stakeholders that the model works as expected. This ensures transparency of the model.Interpretability also popularly known as human-interpretable interpretations (HII) of a machine learning model is the extent to which a human (including non-experts in machine learning) can understand the choices taken by models in their decision-making process (the how, why and what).When comparing models, besides model performance, a model is said to have a better interpretability than another model if its decisions are easier to understand by a human than the decisions from the other model.The Importance of Machine Learning Model InterpretationWhen tackling machine learning problems, data scientists often have a tendency to fixate on model performance metrics like accuracy, precision and recall and so on (This is important no doubt!). This is also prevalent in most online competitions around data science and machine learning. However, metrics only tell a part of the story of a model’s predictive decisions. Over time, the performance might change due to model concept drift caused by various factors in the environment. Hence, it is of paramount importance to understand what drives a model to take certain decisions.Some of us might argue if a model is working great why bother digging deeper? Always remember that when solving data science problems in the real-world, for the business to trust your model predictions and decisions, they will keep asking the question, “Why should I trust your model?” and this makes perfect sense. Would you be satisfied with a model just predicting and taking decisions (the what) like if a person has cancer or diabetes, if a person might be a risk to society or even if a customer will churn? Maybe not, we might prefer it more if we could know more about the model’s decision process (the why and how). This gives us more transparency into why the model makes certain decisions, what might go wrong in certain scenarios and over time it helps us build a certain amount of trust on these machine learning models.The key takeaway from this section is that it is high time we stop seeing machine learning models as black boxes and try and analyze not just data, but how models make decisions. In-fact, some of the key steps towards this path was started by the famous paper, “Why Should I Trust You?” Explaining the Predictions of Any Classifier by M. T. Ribeiro, S. Singh and C. Guestrin, SIGKDD 2016, where they introduce the concept of LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) which we will be covering in the next article in detail.They mention some key points in their paper which are worth remembering.Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model.Whether humans are directly using machine learning classifiers as tools, or are deploying models within other products, a vital concern remains: if the users do not trust a model or a prediction, they will not use it.Interested people should also check out their talk in the KDD conference around their paper in model interpretation.This is something we have discussed several times in this article and is one of the key differentiators which determines the success of data science projects in the industry. This drives the urgency around the need and importance of model interpretation.Criteria for Machine Learning Model Interpretation MethodsThere are specific criteria which can be used for categorizing model interpretation methods. An excellent guide to this is mentioned in “Interpretable Machine Learning, A Guide for Making Black Box Models Explainable” by Christoph Molnar, 2018Intrinsic or post hoc? Intrinsic interpretability is all about leveraging a machine learning model which is intrinsically interpretable in nature (like linear models, parametric models or tree based models). Post hoc interpretability means selecting and training a black box model (ensemble methods or neural networks) and applying interpretability methods after the training (feature importance, partial dependency plots). We will focus more on post hoc model interpretable methods in our series of articles.Model-specific or model-agnostic? Model-specific interpretation tools are very specific to intrinsic model interpretation methods which depend purely on the capabilities and features on a per-model basis. This can be coefficients, p-values, AIC scores pertaining to a regression model, rules from a decision tree and so on. Model-agnostic tools are more relevant to post hoc methods and can be used on any machine learning model. These agnostic methods usually operate by analyzing (and perturbations of inputs) feature input and output pairs. By definition, these methods do not have access to any model internals like weights, constraints or assumptions.Local or global? This classification of interpretation talks about if the interpretation method explains a single prediction or the entire model behavior? Or if the scope is somewhere in between? We will talk more about global and local interpretations soon.This is not an exhaustive set of criteria for classifying interpretable methods since this is still an emerging field, but this can be a good yardstick to compare and contrast across multiple methods.Scope of Machine Learning Model InterpretationHow do we define the scope and boundaries of interpretability? Some useful aspects can be the transparency, fairness and accountability of a model. Global and Local model interpretations are clear ways to define the scope of model interpretation.Summarizing Global and Local Interpretation (Source: DataScience.com)Global InterpretationsThis is all about trying to understand “How does the model make predictions?” and “How do subsets of the model influence model decisions?”. To comprehend and interpret the whole model at once, we need global interpretability. Global interpretability is all about being able to explain and understand model decisions based on conditional interactions between the dependent (response) variable(s) and the independent (predictor) features on the complete dataset. Trying to understand feature interactions and importances is always a good step towards understanding global interpretation. Of course, visualizing features after more than two or three dimensions becomes quite difficult when trying to analyze interactions. Hence, often looking at modular parts and subsets of features, which might influence model predictions on a global knowledge, helps. Complete knowledge of the model structure, assumptions and constraints are needed for a global interpretation.Local InterpretationsThis is all about trying to understand “Why did the model make specific decisions for a single instance?” and “Why did the model make specific decisions for a group of instances?”. For local interpretability, we do not care about the inherent structure or assumptions of a model and we treat it as a black box. For understanding prediction decisions for a single datapoint, we focus specifically on that datapoint and look at a local subregion in our feature space around that point, and try to understand model decisions for that point based on this local region. Local data distributions and feature spaces might behave completely different and give more accurate explanations as opposed to global interpretations. The Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation (LIME) framework is an excellent method which can be used for model-agnostic local interpretation. We can use a combination of global and local interpretations to explain model decisions for a group of instances.Model TransparencyThis is all about trying to understand “How was a model created from algorithms and features?”. We know that typically a machine learning model is all about leveraging an algorithm on top of data features to build a representation which maps inputs to potential outputs(responses). Transparency of a model can be trying to understand more technical details of how models are built and what might influence its decisions. This can be weights of a neural network, weights of a CNN filter, linear model coefficients, the nodes and splits of a decision tree. However, since the business may not be very well-versed in these technical details, trying to explain model decisions with agnostic local and global interpretation methods helps in showcasing model transparency.ConclusionModel Interpretation is something which can make or break a real-world machine learning project in the industry and helps us come one step closer to explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Let’s try and work towards human-interpretable machine learning and XAI to demystify machine learning for everyone and help increase the trust in model decisions.What’s next?In Part 2 of this series, we will be covering the following aspects of explainable artificial intelligence with regard to machine learning model interpretation.Traditional Techniques for Model InterpretationChallenges and Limitations of Traditional TechniquesThe Accuracy vs. Interpretability trade-offModel Interpretation TechniquesThanks to Matthew Mayo for editing and featuring this article on KDNuggets.Thanks to all the wonderful folks at DataScience.com and especially Pramit Choudhary for building an amazing model interpretation framework, Skater, and helping me out with some excellent content for this series.I cover a lot of examples of machine learning model interpretation in my book, “Practical Machine Learning with Python”.

Companies that aren’t investing in artificial intelligence (AI) risk falling behind their competitors. Yet because AI is an umbrella term for several different technologies that each have distinct uses, it is often challenging to know which solution is right for a particular work process.
The most well-known subsets of AI are robotic process automation for automating repetitive tasks, machine-learning to give computer systems the ability to “learn” and improve work processes, and natural language processing (NLP), which enables machines to analyse and understand humans’ imperfect way of writing or talking.
A lesser-known AI technology, however, is natural language generation (NLG). At its simplest, an NLG platform is a computer process that can generate natural language text and speech from pre-defined data. At its most advanced, it powers the responses given by AI assistants, such as Google Home and Amazon’s Alexa, when asked a question.
Though currently relatively nascent, the technology has huge potential for many industries, including journalism, finance, business service and healthcare, for both customer-facing and internal work processes.

Using Natural Language Generation to translate data
A booming use case for NLG is as a tool to translate the hordes of data businesses now collect into intelligent, understandable and actionable insights. A platform can be given a set of rules and parameters to work within, and then fed structured data to output reports, paragraphs and emails that appear as though written by a human.
Automated Insights’ NLG platform, called Wordsmith, was originally built to generate sports post-match recaps and player notes, but the company is now seeing an upswing in demand from firms wanting to generate business intelligence reports.
These include marketing analysis and coherent narratives derived from data straight into company dashboards, so complex statistics can be easily understood by everyone in an organisation without being verbally explained by analysts.
“This automates their expertise in a way everyone can understand to alleviate some of the manual work. Every company is collecting data and people want to know what it means immediately; NLG translates it into something anyone can read and understand,” explains the company’s marketing manager Laura Pressman.
NLG: turning numbers to narratives
This is a huge time saver for businesses. Associated Press, for example, produces 4,400 quarterly business recaps using Wordsmith. Every quarter, when a public company publishes its corporate earnings, instead of a journalist sifting through the information, the technology automatically scans and derives insights from each release, and translates it into written, plain language narrative.
In a similar vein, Emmanuel Walckenaer, chief executive of Yseop, an NLG software platform used by Moody’s, Zachs and Societe Général, says the technology can provide financial advisers with a coherently collated written summary of a client’s transaction history that offers recommendations on where they might like to invest next and why or whether they are risk adverse or not.
Typically, these insights will only be one or two paragraphs in length. Creating longer, more in-depth reports is possible, but requires more rules, protocols and system-training, and several weeks to build, which can be a barrier to adoption.
However, in this capacity the technology has great potential for any situation where data needs to be understood quickly, including complex compliance laws or investigating fraudulent data.
Mr Walckenaer says NLG is currently being used in a “simplistic” way, but disruption will come when it can generate intelligent, informal dialogue for customer interaction management through chatbots or AI assistants.
Helpful conversations - from gaming to customer service
In April, Call of Duty announced a beta release of the Alexa Skill for Call of Duty: WWII, which enables players to ask Amazon’s Alexa how they performed in their last computer game.
Through the home assistant, the gamer will get a response in a character’s tone of voice, giving them analysis of their performance comprising more than 20 factors. It also offers gaming tips and answers to 2,500 questions about the game and an individual player’s performance.
This is a cutting-edge technology that also requires NLP for the machine to understand the question and NLG to reply.
Apoorv Saxena, product manager for cloud AI and AI research at Google, says customer and machine-voice interaction is “the next level of technological difficulty” for NGL, but will eventually improve productivity and economies of scale.
“Businesses have a lot of inquiries they are not able to answer because someone can’t take the call, but if you have a chatbot to do it that helps scale small to medium-sized business and improve productivity,” he says.
The technology has great potential for any situation where data needs to be understood quickly
Like other AI technologies, NLG has advanced considerably over the last ten years, but there is still a lot of work to do around customisation and conversation. Furthermore, even for the more simple use-cases, such as generating reports, it can still take a few weeks to adopt.
Mr Saxena says the technology will evolve “but we don’t know how yet”, adding that Google is investing significantly in developing NLG.
Further down the line, perhaps there will be NLG voice systems that recognise when a customer is upset and adjust their tone accordingly or give basic financial advice over the phone based on a person’s financial statistics, freeing up staff for more complex tasks.

Artificial intelligence to help Dutch police solve cold cases: report




The Dutch police are using new artificial intelligence software to breathe new life into cold cases. The new software is specifically used to help hunt down still at large murderers and sex offenders, the Telegraaf reports.
The artificial intelligence will look at cold cases and identify which of them contain promising clues and trace evidence, so that they can be picked up again and reassessed with new forensic techniques. ""At the current rate, we would be working for decades to map out the traces in all cold cases"", Roel Wolfert of the Oost-Nederland police's Q-team said to the newspaper. The Q-team therefore teamed up with an external ICT partner to find a way to speed things up. ""We built a system that has been taught to read digitized files and to automatically map out the forensic traces.""
The Dutch police force is the first one in the world to start using this technology. ""We are proud of this innovative way of detecting"", Wolfert said to the newspaper. ""We are on the verge of a new technological development.""
Cold case teams across the Netherlands are delighted by this new technology. ""This saves us an unspeakable amount of work"", forensic detective Carina van Leeuwen said to the Telegraaf. ""There are at least fifteen hundred cold case investigations in the Netherlands. Examining all of them manually is not feasible. Promising files remain on the shelf and that is unacceptable. For us, but certainly also for the surviving relatives.""
According to Van Leeuwen, many old files contain information about forensic trace evidence that can lead directly to a perpetrator with today's technology. The artificial intelligence software will help them find these promising cases quickly. ""The search system is no substitute for detectives"", she said. ""A murder investigation always remains human work. But with this help we can avoid a lot of ineffective work and immediately start looking for offenders. In this way, an analysis only takes one day instead of weeks.""

 The Honor 10 is the thinking person's phone; the ultimate mix of affordability without compromising design or features. Available in a stunning Phantom Blue two-tone reflective finish, its beauty isn't just skin deep: for this phone's AI Camera means it can, in essence, think for itself when it comes to photography. 






 This push forward in artificial intelligence - which is supported by the phone's Kirin 970 processor with Neural Processing Unit (NPU) - means the Honor 10 can auto-identify scene types, adjust its settings accordingly, then make dynamic exposure and colour adjustments as applicable for the best-looking images possible. 

Honor 10: With flagship specs at a mid-range price, it's the affordable phone to own  

 The Honor 10 also features dual cameras: there's a black-and-white one for capturing the ultimate in monochrome clarity, paired with a colour one for more traditional shooting. Intelligence comes to the fore again here, however, as the colour can be mapped over the better detail of the mono capture for the utmost in quality at 24 megapixels, while Portrait and Aperture modes use depth data for pro-looking blurred background shots. 






 Combined, the Honor 10 packs in stacks of features that make it the best mid-price phone camera. Here we break-down some of its top features and how they work. 

 AI Camera 
 Machine learning for auto scene recognition  Brings out best colour by intelligently adjusting settings based on the subject  

 The Honor 10's premier feature is clearly marked by the ""AI Camera"" white text that's printed upon its rear. The real beauty of this artificial intelligence camera is that it takes on the hard work, so you don't have to. If you're not a pro when it comes to pictures, then this can help immensely by ensuring the best exposure, colour, saturation, dynamic range and contrast. 

 The system can function thanks to the top-end flagship chipset at the heart of the Honor 10. It features a Neural Processing Unit (NPU) that can decode and make decisions far quicker than a traditional processing unit. As the Honor 10 benefits from machine learning, the camera's ""brain"" has already sampled millions of images to help quickly and automatically recognise what is in a scene. Then the camera auto-selects the most applicable scene. 





 Pocket-lint   

 You don't need to worry about the scene: you'll see a little symbol pop-up in the Camera app to represent what's been selected. Whether it's Text for shooting writing; Food when capturing your trendy dinner for Instagram; Panda when shooting the lovely fluffy black and white bears (no, really, this is a distinct mode); or any number of landscape, portrait and pet modes - the Honor 10 has your back. 

 It's possible to see a before-vs-after of what AI does to an image, too. Simply click on the multi-coloured circular AI emblem to the top of the Camera app to disengage the mode. Do this in the Gallery when looking at a captured shot and you'll be able to see the difference between with and without. As you can see from our sample images, the AI Camera does a good job of enhancing colours based on the scene, while pulling extra detail out of shadow areas in particular. 





 Aperture mode 
 Dual cameras with f/1.8 apertures  f/0.95 to f/16 available via software  Adjust background blur after shooting  

 While both of the Honor 10's cameras have fast apertures (each on the rear is f/1.8) which help to capture a lot of light and make light work of low-light shooting, the benefit of having two lenses is that depth data can be derived to perform some clever software trickery. That pro-looking blurred background effect that professionals like to use so much? That's called bokeh - and the Honor 10 can mimic this type of imagery too in its Aperture mode thanks to intelligent software processing.

 Within Aperture mode you'll see a small circular symbol with a number beneath, ranging from 0.95 to 16. The smaller that number the more pronounced the background blur will appear to be. Simply click on a subject to focus, select the sliding aperture scale, drag it to the position you desire - you might want a little background sense, or total blurring, it's up to your creative style - and that's it, job done. 

 As the Honor 10's two lenses are always capturing this depth data, any shot taken in Aperture mode can be adjusted after shooting. Maybe f/0.95 was a bit too much, so you make adjustments to f/4.0 instead. It's even possible to change the focus point - so if the background is in focus by accident, you can drag the focus area to the main subject instead. Clever stuff. 

 Portrait mode 
 Bokeh, Beauty and Lighting control for ultimate portraits  Phase-detection autofocus for quick focus  






 When shooting people, the Honor 10 has a whole box of tricks to call upon. Not only does the AI Camera mean faces are automatically recognised, but both Bokeh  control, Beauty mode, and 3D Lighting formats can also be deployed when using Portrait mode. 

  

 That might sound a little complex, but it's easy to use: the camera focuses on the subject's face quickly thanks to phase-detection autofocus; blurred background Bokeh can be enabled or disengaged by the click of a button (as can Beauty mode, which blurs facial blemishes out of view); while the Lighting options (sift, butterfly, split, stage, classic) can add positional lighting or spotlights to give an even more stand-out effect. 

 You can even automatically take a photo when the subject smiles, using the Capture Smiles feature within the settings. 

 Monochrome mode 
 True black and white sensor for crisp B&W results  Also offers Portrait and Aperture modes  






 One feature the Honor 10 has that no other camera phones in the UK (except Huawei) can offer is a true monochrome format. Now, you might be thinking ""but why shoot black and white, when I can convert it from colour anyway?"" 

  

 The reason is a more technical one: because a monochrome sensor has no filter over the top to discern the colour to apply to each pixel of the image, it can receive a cleaner signal, which gives sharper results and a wider dynamic range for great tonal separation between true black and true white. 

 If you fancy dabbling in 24-megapixel monochrome shooting then the mode is available in the More section of the Camera app. It's also possible to select Aperture and Portrait additions within Monochrome, should you wish to apply the intelligence of such modes too. 

 Pro shooting for when you need it 
 Metering, ISO sensitivity, shutter speed, exposure compensation, focus type and white balance controls  






 All of this automation, artificial intelligence and wide feature set is great to have for ease of use. But the Honor 10 doesn't back down when it comes to more experienced snappers: there's a Pro mode that provides full manual control. 

 Pocket-lint   

 Some of that can be exceptionally useful. Set the shutter speed to 30 seconds and the ISO to 50, for example, and a perfectly stable camera shot of a night scene will bring out details and blurry subject movement (like light trails or smoothed running water) that wouldn't be possible in a point-and-shoot format. 

 Great video, too 
 4K UHD capture at 30fps  Slow-Mo at 120fps  

 Affordable phones don't mean cutting corners when it comes to features. In addition to the top-rate photography features, the Honor 10 also squeezes in Ultra-HD 4K video capture. 





 Settings include Object Tracking to keep focus on the subject at hand, while Stabiliser softens out the worst hand-shake for smoother, steadier results. 

 That's not all. Slow-Mo is also available, which captures at 120 frames per second for quarter-time slow-motion in super smooth quality.

Using artificial intelligence to measure the heart

Artificial intelligence can now help clinicians by automatically measuring the heart in ultrasound images. This can save time and may in the future enable inexperienced users to perform accurate measurements of the heart.
When performing ultrasound examinations of the heart, several measurements are done in order to determine how healthy the heart is. One of these measurements is left ventricular ejection fraction, which measures the pumping efficiency of the heart.
In order to calculate the ejection fraction, we need to calculate the volume of the heart chamber. To do this, clinicians have to acquire images from two perpendicular angles, also knownn as views, of the heart, and then manually draw the heart chamber wall on the images. This can be time-consuming, and is also subject to large interobserver variability, meaning that two different doctors may draw the heart chamber wall quite differently, thereby resulting in different volume measurements.
An inexperienced user may not even know were to draw the heart wall, an automatic tool may in the future enable these users to perform necessary measurements. At the Centre for Innovative Ultrasound Solutions (CIUS), we are working on completely automating ultrasound heart measurements using deep learning.

Learning by example
Deep learning is a type of machine learning which are algorithms that learn to solve a task by looking at a large amount of examples. Most machine learning methods today use what is called deep neural networks, which are inspired by the way human brains work. For instance, to create a neural network which can detect whether an image contains a dog or not, you collect a large set of images with and without dogs. You then train the neural network with these images, and for every image the system has to say whether the image contains dogs or not. If the result is incorrect, the neural network has to adjust itself, so that it will not make the same mistake again. By doing this many enough times and with enough variation in the input images, the system will learn what a dog
looks like automatically!
In order to automate the ejection fraction measurements, the neural networks have to learn several tasks such as:

View classification: Learns to identify which images are of the different angles/views of the heart.
Left ventricle segmentation: Learns to draw the heart chamber wall.

To learn these tasks, ultrasound images from several hundred patients were collected in cooperation with CREATIS in France and manually annotated by human experts. The neural networks are quite big, having several million parameters which have to be
adjusted during training.
The neural network result of finding the heart walls, identifying the different views, and when the chamber is largest and smallest.
Does it work in real-life?
The artificial intelligence methods were implemented in a high performance computing framework called FAST. This enables us to stream ultrasound data directly from a scanner and calculate the measurements in real-time while the operator is scanning as shown in this
video:
Together with clinician Ivar Mjåland Salte at the Sørlandet Hospital in Kristiansand, we performed a study to see how well our methods can do these measurements automatically compared to manually drawing the heart wall contour. Ultrasound recordings of 72 patients was collected and manually annotated. The neural network was able to automatically and quite accurately calculate ejection fraction for all patients, even for patients with low image quality ultrasound images.
Ejection fraction is only one of many clinical measurements of the heart, we are currently working on extending the neural networks to learn several other measurements, such as MAPSE, LV mass and strain.
An inexperienced user may not know where to place and how to angle the ultrasound probe correctly. This is necessary to get valid measurements of the heart. At CIUS, we are also developing an artificial intelligent assistant which can guide inexperienced users to acquire correct ultrasound images of the heart.
