Share full article186Read in appConor Sprouls at a MetLife call center where software using artificial intelligence gives workers feedback.Credit...Tony Luong for The New York TimesBy Kevin RooseJune 23, 2019Leer en españolWhen Conor Sprouls, a customer service representative in the call center of the insurance giant MetLife talks to a customer over the phone, he keeps one eye on the bottom-right corner of his screen. There, in a little blue box, A.I. tells him how he’s doing.Talking too fast? The program flashes an icon of a speedometer, indicating that he should slow down.Sound sleepy? The software displays an “energy cue,” with a picture of a coffee cup.Not empathetic enough? A heart icon pops up.For decades, people have fearfully imagined armies of hyper-efficient robots invading offices and factories, gobbling up jobs once done by humans. But in all of the worry about the potential of artificial intelligence to replace rank-and-file workers, we may have overlooked the possibility it will replace the bosses, too.ImageThe application Cogito on view on a monitor.Credit...Tony Luong for The New York TimesMr. Sprouls and the other call center workers at his office in Warwick, R.I., still have plenty of human supervisors. But the software on their screens — made by Cogito, an A.I. company in Boston — has become a kind of adjunct manager, always watching them. At the end of every call, Mr. Sprouls’s Cogito notifications are tallied and added to a statistics dashboard that his supervisor can view. If he hides the Cogito window by minimizing it, the program notifies his supervisor.Cogito is one of several A.I. programs used in call centers and other workplaces. The goal, according to Joshua Feast, Cogito’s chief executive, is to make workers more effective by giving them real-time feedback.“There is variability in human performance,” Mr. Feast said. “We can infer from the way people are speaking with each other whether things are going well or not.”The goal of automation has always been efficiency, but in this new kind of workplace, A.I. sees humanity itself as the thing to be optimized. Amazon uses complex algorithms to track worker productivity in its fulfillment centers, and can automatically generate the paperwork to fire workers who don’t meet their targets, as The Verge uncovered this year. (Amazon has disputed that it fires workers without human input, saying that managers can intervene in the process.) IBM has used Watson, its A.I. platform, during employee reviews to predict future performance and claims it has a 96 percent accuracy rate.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThen there are the start-ups. Cogito, which works with large insurance companies like MetLife and Humana as well as financial and retail firms, says it has 20,000 users. Percolata, a Silicon Valley company that counts Uniqlo and 7-Eleven among its clients, uses in-store sensors to calculate a “true productivity” score for each worker, and rank workers from most to least productive.ImageSamantha Sinon knitting while she waits for the next call at MetLife’s center in Warwick, R.I.Credit...Tony Luong for The New York TimesImageAaron Osei, another employee at the center.Credit...Tony Luong for The New York TimesManagement by algorithm is not a new concept. In the early 20th century, Frederick Winslow Taylor revolutionized the manufacturing world with his “scientific management” theory, which tried to wring inefficiency out of factories by timing and measuring each aspect of a job. More recently, Uber, Lyft and other on-demand platforms have made billions of dollars by outsourcing conventional tasks of human resources — scheduling, payroll, performance reviews — to computers.But using A.I. to manage workers in conventional, 9-to-5 jobs has been more controversial. Critics have accused companies of using algorithms for managerial tasks, saying that automated systems can dehumanize and unfairly punish employees. And while it’s clear why executives would want A.I. that can track everything their workers do, it’s less clear why workers would.ImageMetLife uses the A.I. software with 1,500 of its call center employees.Credit...Tony Luong for The New York Times“It is surreal to think that any company could fire their own workers without any human involvement,” Marc Perrone, the president of United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which represents food and retail workers, said in a statement about Amazon in April. 

Kevin Roose and Casey Newton are the hosts of Hard Fork, a podcast that makes sense of the rapidly changing world of technology. Subscribe and listen.In the gig economy, management by algorithm has also been a source of tension between workers and the platforms that connect them with customers. This year, drivers for Postmates, DoorDash and other on-demand delivery companies protested a method of calculating their pay, using an algorithm, that put customer tips toward guaranteed minimum wages — a practice that was nearly invisible to drivers, because of the way the platform obscures the details of worker pay.There were no protests at MetLife’s call center. Instead, the employees I spoke with seemed to view their Cogito software as a mild annoyance at worst. Several said they liked getting pop-up notifications during their calls, although some said they had struggled to figure out how to get the “empathy” notification to stop appearing. (Cogito says the A.I. analyzes subtle differences in tone between the worker and the caller and encourages the worker to try to mirror the customer’s mood.)MetLife, which uses the software with 1,500 of its call center employees, says using the app has increased its customer satisfaction by 13 percent.ImageWinners of contests and employee photos are pinned up in the office.Credit...Tony Luong for The New York TimesImageA team performance board.Credit...Tony Luong for The New York TimesAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“It actually changes people’s behavior without them knowing about it,” said Christopher Smith, MetLife’s head of global operations. “It becomes a more human interaction.”Still, there is a creepy sci-fi vibe to a situation in which A.I. surveils human workers and tells them how to relate to other humans. And it is reminiscent of the “workplace gamification” trend that swept through corporate America a decade ago, when companies used psychological tricks borrowed from video games, like badges and leader boards, to try to spur workers to perform better.Phil Libin, the chief executive of All Turtles, an A.I. start-up studio in San Francisco, recoiled in horror when I told him about my call center visit.“That is a dystopian hellscape,” Mr. Libin said. “Why would anyone want to build this world where you’re being judged by an opaque, black-box computer?”Defenders of workplace A.I. might argue that these systems are not meant to be overbearing. Instead, they’re meant to make workers better by reminding them to thank the customer, to empathize with the frustrated claimant on Line 1 or to avoid slacking off on the job.ImageIcons that are used in Cogito are placed around the MetLife call center.Credit...Tony Luong for The New York TimesThe best argument for workplace A.I. may be situations in which human bias skews decision-making, such as hiring. Pymetrics, a New York start-up, has made inroads in the corporate hiring world by replacing the traditional résumé screening process with an A.I. program that uses a series of games to test for relevant skills. The algorithms are then analyzed to make sure they are not creating biased hiring outcomes, or favoring one group over another.“We can tweak data and algorithms until we can remove the bias. We can’t do that with a human being,” said Frida Polli, Pymetrics’ chief executive.Using A.I. to correct for human biases is a good thing. But as more A.I. enters the workplace, executives will have to resist the temptation to use it to tighten their grip on their workers and subject them to constant surveillance and analysis. If that happens, it won’t be the robots staging an uprising.Follow Kevin Roose on Twitter: @kevinroose.Kevin Roose is a columnist for Business Day and a writer-at-large for The New York Times Magazine.

 Eight Essential Interview Questions CEOs Swear By













Microsoft was one of the earliest companies to begin discussing and advocating for an ethical perspective on artificial intelligence. The issue began to take off at the company in 2016, when CEO Satya Nadella spoke at a developer conference about how the company viewed some of the ethical issues around AI, and later that year published an article about these issues. Nadella’s primary focus was on Microsoft’s orientation toward using AI to augment human capabilities and building trust into intelligent products. The next year, Microsoft’s R&D head Eric Horvitz partnered with Microsoft’s president and chief legal officer Brad Smith to form Aether, a cross-functional committee addressing AI and ethics in engineering and research. 
With these foundations laid, in 2018, Microsoft established a full-time position in AI policy and ethics. Tim O’Brien, who has been with Microsoft for 15 years as a general manager, first in platform strategy and then global communications, took on the role. 
Of course, many organizations are increasingly paying attention to ethical issues around AI. In a 2018 Deloitte survey, 32% of AI-aware executives ranked the ethical risks of AI as one of their top three AI-related concerns. Microsoft and O’Brien are essentially bellwethers on this issue — the figurative sheep at the head of the flock — in creating a role focused on, as O’Brien puts it, AI ethics “advocacy and evangelism.” 
I talked with O’Brien to find out how his role came about, what he does in it, and what kinds of policies might emerge at Microsoft because of his work. I also asked him how the AI ethicist role might relate to similar positions at other companies.
How the AI Ethicist Job Came About
O’Brien told me that he was inspired by the early steps Microsoft’s leaders had taken on AI ethics, and that he asked to pursue the topic for the company as his primary job. He’d been a product marketer for various tech companies early in his career and spent much of the last 15 years at Microsoft pitching developers on why they should build stuff on the company’s platforms.

I asked O’Brien if he was hiding a philosophy or theology degree on his LinkedIn profile, but he laughingly said no. He said he did have some exposure to ethics issues in his business law classes as an MBA student and that he went to a Jesuit high school — a Catholic order known for its focus on ethics and philosophy. That’s it, though, for his formal educational preparation in ethics.
His interest developed when was running Microsoft’s Global Communications function outside the U.S., a role that had him traveling constantly and frequently exposed to the “geopolitics of technology,” as he put it. He began to realize, he said, that leaving all of businesses’ ethical and policy issues to the lawyers was not sufficient. O’Brien was seeing that, as data and processing move to the cloud, technology, policy, and geography issues all were starting to collide. 
O’Brien was quick to point out that he’s standing on the shoulders of giants. “Most of the ideas I talk about are not mine,” he said. He mentioned that Microsoft president Smith has been preaching the AI ethics gospel for several years now, and indeed Smith speaks and writes regularly about the need to consider the ethical, social, and political aspects of the technology. O’Brien sees part of his role as helping to disseminate Smith’s ideas at scale — Smith is a powerful steward for responsible AI at Microsoft, but he’s a busy guy. And the ethical issues around AI are sufficiently complex and nuanced that Smith can’t campaign for them all.
How an AI Ethicist Spends His Time
O’Brien’s job began in May 2018, and he began traveling around the world almost immediately. His primary activities have included giving speeches at conferences, meeting with Microsoft customers, leading a research effort, talking with analysts and researchers, and coordinating activity across Microsoft. 
O’Brien’s presentations have focused on topics such as avoiding algorithmic bias and creating transparency in AI models. Some of Microsoft’s ideas on these issues have been described in the press. It’s important to clarify that although O’Brien’s job title is focused on AI, he promotes ethical perspectives on all information technologies. O’Brien said he views AI as the “spark that lit ethics in tech,” including analytics, the internet of things, and virtual and augmented reality, as well as AI. Many solutions in the real world are, of course, hybrids of these technologies.









The goal of the research initiative he heads is to develop a global perspective on tech ethics. In his previous job, O’Brien observed that different societies around the world have very different perspectives on privacy and ethics. Just within Europe, for example, U.K. citizens are willing to tolerate video camera monitoring on London’s central High Street, perhaps because of IRA bombings of the past, while Germans are much more privacy oriented, influenced by the former intrusions of East German Stasi spies. O’Brien suggested that in China, the public is tolerant of AI-driven applications like facial recognition and social credit scores at least in part because social order is a key tenet of Confucian moral philosophy. 
Microsoft’s AI ethics research project involves ethnographic analysis of different cultures, gathered through close observation of behaviors, and advice from external academics such as Erin Meyer of INSEAD, who wrote The Culture Map. It may result in a number of publications, depending on the findings. My feeling, and O’Brien’s as well, is that there aren’t a lot of sources out there on global tech ethics. This research could start to fill that gap.
Within Microsoft, O’Brien is trying to extend the community of people who are focused on the ethics topic. He sent me a collection of materials suggesting that lots of people are already engaged. The materials include, for example, a blog post on Microsoft guidelines about developing responsible conversation bots (no doubt occasioned by the off-the-rails comments from the Tay AI chatbot research project in 2016). They also include a presentation and article on intelligible models in health care, and an internal project for a “learning door” that recognizes (with opt-in) who is coming in and out of Microsoft buildings. O’Brien said he works closely with Smith’s legal team and also has a matrixed reporting relationship to Eric Horvitz, technical fellow and director at Microsoft Research Labs. Of course, Microsoft is a big company, but awareness of AI ethics seems to be catching on rapidly and broadly there.
This bottom-up, middle-out approach to change is what CEO Nadella is trying to inculcate within the Microsoft culture. The days of asking for a million dollars and a hundred people for a new project are over, O’Brien says. The desired approach is to get an idea in action and try to attract the needed resources over time.

AI Policy Development at Microsoft
O’Brien expects that there will eventually be a collection of policies within Microsoft about how to use AI and related technologies. Some have already emerged, such as Smith’s 2018 directive on facial recognition technologies, which stated through a blog post that Microsoft would not sell its technology for facial recognition in ways that can “adversely affect consumers and citizens” or “encroach on democratic freedoms and human rights.” 
O’Brien believes there will be a number of other policies that the company will define, from avoiding algorithmic bias to model transparency to specific applications like predictive policing. Microsoft’s activism in the privacy and ethics space isn’t new; it has battled the U.S. government on the privacy of sensitive customer data in the cloud (the case was eventually vacated by the U.S. Supreme Court after legislative action), and also filed a brief in support of Apple’s privacy position on the iPhone linked to the shootings that took place in 2015 in San Bernadino, California.
But there are many questions on which concrete policies remain to be developed. O’Brien mentions, for example, mistakes made by AI systems and legal remediation for harm from AI. He believes that the most interesting part of the field is the many unresolved questions within it. 
Microsoft is a big player in AI and tech more broadly, so there is little doubt in my mind that having an AI ethicist role is a good idea for the company. In the time since O’Brien was named to the role, Salesforce.com and a few other vendors have created similar positions. Other companies that are not major IT vendors may not want to advocate as strongly in public about AI-related issues. And it wouldn’t be a good idea to create an AI ethicist role without the strong leadership and support from senior executives that Microsoft exhibits. However, as I have suggested, many other businesses will face issues similar to the ones that O’Brien is wrestling with for Microsoft, and having an internal role or group to address them will be useful.

The ethical debate is a great dilemma for modern societies.

It is so uplifting to read and witness evidence of advancing the humanities through increased focus on these most fundamental and cardinal topics of Ethics and philosophy. Maybe we should rightly also call it a retrospective and revisit to our heritage - as O'Brien mentions, we are standing on shoulders of giants - founding fathers of Ethics include Socrates, Aristotle, Plato, and the list goes on and on. When push comes to show it is all we got.  This is about technology, not just AI as O'Brien points out, it is about technology ethics and then it automatically ultimately is ALL about humans. And although lawyers are humans Technology Ethics and for that matter Business Ethics is about more than the law, being a regulative idea at best, Ethics is about life in the broadest sense and how humans interact with each other and e.g. technology - in short, the law does not suffice! It's a relief to see a guy on that level have the courage to go beyond ""AI"" and embrace the Technology domain fully - bravo. These initiatives by MS, SF, SAP et. al. are recommendable and as O'Brien indicates needs to broader than AI, and even broader that Technology - with recent years scandals we need Ethics on the agenda in Business in general. I'm both sorry and happy to state that Legal and compliance will no longer suffice.

It was adopted during the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Education, held in Beijing from 16 – 18 May 2019, by over 50 government ministers, international representatives from over 105 Member States and almost 100 representatives from UN agencies, academic institutions, civil society and the private sector.The Beijing Consensus comes after the Qingdao Declaration of 2015, in which UNESCO Member States committed to efficiently harness emerging technologies for the achievement of SDG 4.Ms Stefania Giannini, Assistant Director-General for Education at UNESCO, stated that ‘’we need to renew this commitment as we move towards an era in which artificial intelligence – a convergence of emerging technologies – is transforming every aspect of our lives (…) we need to steer this revolution in the right direction, to improve livelihoods, to reduce inequalities and promote a fair and inclusive globalization.’’The Consensus affirms that the deployment of AI technologies in education should be purposed to enhance human capacities and to protect human rights for effective human-machine collaboration in life, learning and work, and for sustainable development. The Consensus states that the systematic integration of AI in education has the potential to address some of the biggest challenges in education today, innovate teaching and learning practices, and ultimately accelerate the progress towards SDG 4. In summary, the Beijing Consensus recommends governments and other stakeholders in UNESCO’s Member States to:Plan AI in education policies in response to the opportunities and challenges AI technologies bring, from a whole-government, multi-stakeholder, and inter-sectoral approach, that also allow for setting up local strategic priorities to achieve SDG 4 targetsSupport the development of new models enabled by AI technologies for delivering education and training where the benefits clearly outweigh the risks, and use AI tools to offer lifelong learning systems which enable personalized learning anytime, anywhere, for anyoneConsider the use of relevant data where appropriate to drive the development of evidence-based policy planningEnsure AI technologies are used to empower teachers rather than replace them, and develop appropriate capacity-building programmes for teachers to work alongside AI systemsPrepare the next generation of existing workforce with the values and skills for life and work most relevant in the AI eraPromote equitable and inclusive use of AI irrespective of disability, social or economic status, ethnic or cultural background or geographical location, with a strong emphasis on gender equality, as well as ensure ethical, transparent and auditable uses of educational dataThe Consensus also details its ambitions for UNESCO to act as a support system for the capacity building of education policy-makers to implement the recommended measures, and to act as a convener for financing, partnership and international cooperation together with other international organizations and partners active in the field of AI in education.Suggested implementations for the Director-General of UNESCO include the establishment of an ‘AI for Education’ platform that would supply crucial resources for open consultation, such as open-source AI courses & tools, policies and best practices. Together with UNESCO Member States, the DG is encouraged to develop guidelines and further resources for effective and equitable use of AI in education.The Consensus also recognizes the pressing issue of country and regional divides in AI development, and tasks partners and international organizations to monitor and assess the impact of these divides, keeping in mind the risk of polarization between those who have access to it and those who do not.Together with partners, international organizations, and the key values that UNESCO holds as pillars of their mandate, UNESCO hopes to strengthen their leading role in AI in education.As Ms Giannini has said; ‘’implementing AI in and for Education is about shifting from competition to cooperation. The Consensus adopted today will guide our actions.’’If you want to leverage emerging technologies like AI to bolster the education sector, we look forward to partnering with you through financial, in-kind or technical advice contributions.The Beijing Consensus is available in the six official languages of the UN.Share                             Copied to clipboard Related itemsEducationArtificial intelligenceEducational technologyMore on this subject   Event Global Media and Information Literacy Week Feature Conference 202430 October 2024 - 31 October 2024     Event Digital Learning Week2 September 2024 - 6 September 2024     Story Advancing AI Ethics in Bangladesh15 July 2024     News Abu Dhabi DCT strengthens its capacity to monitor mechanisms for the Implementation of the 2003 Convention14 July 2024  Other recent news   News Abu Dhabi DCT strengthens its capacity to monitor mechanisms for the Implementation of the 2003 Convention14 July 2024     News UNESCO and European Judicial Training Network partner to train judges on Artificial Intelligence and Rule of Law11 July 2024     News Innovative digital and greening education projects from Republic of Korea and Belgium win UNESCO ICT Prize11 July 2024     News Making AI more open could accelerate research and tech transfer10 July 2024   ","[{'@type': 'NewsArticle', 'headline': 'First ever consensus on Artificial Intelligence and Education published by UNESCO', 'image': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'representativeOfPage': 'True', 'url': 'https://www.unesco.org/sites/default/files/education-ai-consensus.jpg', 'width': '708', 'height': '368'}, 'datePublished': '2023-04-20T16:56:50+0200', 'isAccessibleForFree': 'True', 'dateModified': '2023-04-20T16:56:50+0200', 'mainEntityOfPage': 'https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/first-ever-consensus-artificial-intelligence-and-education-published-unesco'}, {'@type': 'Event', 'eventAttendanceMode': 'MixedEventAttendanceMode', 'location': {'@type': 'Place', 'address': {'@type': 'PostalAddress', 'streetAddress': ''}}}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Artificial intelligence experts interviewed in a new video series say government’s adoption of AI technologies is accelerating — and they predict AI’s role as a virtual assistant will help federal workers rather than lead to job losses.
The “AI Innovators” video series, produced by FedScoop and underwritten by Accenture, brought together public sector experts to discuss the impact AI is expected to have on agencies’ ability to fulfill their missions and serve citizens.
These leaders also lay out some of the key issues agencies will need to face as AI tools play a greater role in the daily workloads and decisions of federal workers. Among other questions, the series explores:
What is the future of artificial intelligence?
“The No. 1 thing that leads adoption of technology is utility,” says Margaret Smith, senior manager analytics at Accenture Federal Services.
As more individuals become accustomed to small AI features in their everyday life — for example recommendation or optimal route suggestions on GPS — AI becomes ingrained in workers’ expectations. That will put increased pressure on government to keep pace with advancements from the private sector to match citizens’ expectations.
AI features can also improve service work, such as enhancing the patient-practitioner partnership, explains Kristen Honey, innovator in residence in the office of the CTO at the Department of Health and Human Services.
“AI and algorithms could do more for data mining and translation work so that practitioners can get back to focusing on the patients,” Honey explains.
In regard to national security, Lt. Gen. Jack Shanahan, director for the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center doesn’t envision any part of the Department of Defense that will not be enhanced by AI; including everything from multi-domain operations at the edge, all the way to the back-office business functions.
“If we imagine a future 20 years hence … and the DOD is a completely AI-enabled force, the fact that it is would not by itself imply that we will win [future conflicts]. But if we do not have a fully AI-enabled force, in my opinion we would incur an unacceptably high risk of losing that conflict,” he cautions.
In a future where data and algorithms are critical to AI functioning correctly, the rise of the chief data officer role is key, said Timothy Persons, chief scientist and managing director at the Government Accountability Office. There needs to be a symbiosis between the CIO and the perspective of chief data officers, where both see data “not just as a burden for the CIO to manage and secure…but for data to become a key asset of the way federal agencies think.”
How will artificial intelligence impact our work?
Often agencies have more work than people to do that work, and leaders see how AI can be a solution to some workforce gaps.
“If there is a way to unpack a job into tasks that are very routine, there’s a way to have an AI co-worker work alongside one of the government workers…[that] lets them focus on things they really want to spend time on,” shares Dominic Delmolino, CTO at Accenture Federal Services.
GAO’s Persons adds that by taking hours off processing time for employees to synthesize vast amounts of information “allows us to be better versions of ourselves.”
There is a lot of ways to prioritize what AI initiatives to focus on, elaborates Smith, “but what’s most effective is identifying tasks people don’t like doing; daily jobs or routines that no one likes to do, but they have to.”
What are the limitations of artificial intelligence?
Many leaders agree that the biggest limitation to implementing AI tools is a cultural barrier.
“What we need are more people that have the breadth and depth of understanding what AI can do,” Shanahan said. He shares the need to grow generations of people that have experience implementing AI, otherwise it will remain out of reach for organizations to grasp “the art of the possible.”
Persons echoes the need for a younger generation to move into management positions with people who are digital natives; those who know how to deal with data and think algorithmically. There is a difference between augmenting human tasks with the AI versus doing the same thing in a more routinized way, he says.
But overall most agree with a sentiment stated by Shanahan, “There is no time better than the present to dive into AI and get a project started. Admiring the problem from afar won’t do anything to accelerate the adoption and integration of AI to achieve impact of mission at scale.”
Other participants in the AI Innovators video series include:

Ira Entis, Managing Director, Growth and Strategy, Accenture Federal Services
Courtney Winship, Chief, Digital Services Division, Office of Citizenship & Applicant Information Services, USCIS
Charles Worthington, CTO and Sr. Technology Advisor, Department of Veterans Affairs
Keith Nakasone, Deputy Assistant Commissioner, Acquisition, Office IT Category, GSA

June 25, 2019 - The White House is calling for more transparency and “explainability” in healthcare artificial intelligence.
Currently many algorithms are opaque to users, which creates problems for doctors, who need transparency to justify their diagnoses or treatment of patients.
This is one argument made by the National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan: 2019 Update released June 21 by the National Science and Technology Council in the Executive Office of the President.

“AI techniques such as decision-tree induction provide built-in explanations but are generally less accurate. Thus, researchers must develop systems that are transparent, and intrinsically capable of explaining the reasons for their results to users,” particularly in healthcare, the plan argued.
For the 2019 update, the council issued a request for information (RFI) in August of last year to get public feedback on ways the strategic plan should be revised or improved. This feedback, as well as an independent agency review, led to the update of the 2016 plan.
“A significant number of responses noted the importance of investing in the application of AI in areas such as manufacturing and supply chains; healthcare; medical imaging; meteorology, hydrology, climatology, and related areas; cybersecurity; education; data-intensive physical sciences such as high-energy physics; and transportation,” the plan related.
Respondents also argued for fairness, ethics, accountability, and transparency in AI systems, as well as curated and accessible datasets, workforce implications, and public-private partnerships in AI research and development. 
Noting the rapid rise of privately funded AI R&D projects and the rapid adoption of AI by industry, respondents also advocated increased federal government engagement with the private sector.
Strategic Priorities for Federally Funded AI Research
The plan identified eight strategic priorities for federally funded AI research:

Make long-term investments in AI research; prioritize investments in the next generation of AI that will drive discovery and insight and enable the United States to remain a leader in AI
Develop effective methods for human-AI collaboration; increase understanding of how to create AI systems that complement and augment human capabilities
Address the ethical, legal, and societal implications of AI; research AI systems that incorporate ethical, legal, and societal concerns through technical mechanisms
Ensure the safety and security of AI systems; advance knowledge of how to design AI systems that are reliable, dependable, safe, and trustworthy
Develop shared public datasets and environments for AI training and testing; enable access to high-quality datasets and environments, as well as to testing and training resources
Evaluate AI technologies using standards and benchmarks; develop a spectrum of evaluative techniques for AI
Understand the national AI R&D workforce needs; improve opportunities for workforce development to foster an AI-ready workforce
Expand public-private partnerships to accelerate advances in AI; promote opportunities for sustained investment in AI R&D and for transitioning advances into capabilities, in collaboration with academia, industry, international partners, and other non-federal entities

“AI has advanced tremendously and today promises better, more accurate healthcare; enhanced national security; improved transportation; and more effective education, to name just a few benefits. Increased computing power, the availability of large datasets and streaming data, and algorithmic advances in machine learning (ML) have made it possible for AI development to create new sectors of the economy and revitalize industries,” the plan noted.
“AI technologies are critical for addressing a range of long-term challenges, such as constructing advanced healthcare systems, a robust intelligent transportation system, and resilient energy and telecommunication networks,” the plan concluded.

India will need a lot more talent in the space. ""Only 1-2% of India's workforce in the tech and financial sectors have AI/ ML (machine learning) and data science knowledge,"" says Santanu Paul, CEO of Hyderabad-based edtech player TalentSprint, which launched an executive programme in AI/ML in association with IIIT-H last year. 69834351 LinkedIn said last year that seven out of 10 emerging jobs in India are tech-focused roles hinged on AI/ML, with ML engineer being the top job in the list.Nasscom says emerging job roles in AI include that of data architect, applied scientist, ML speech vision, analyst BI, and DevOps Engineer. Ajay Shah, head of recruitment services at HR solutions provider Teamlease, says the average hike being commanded by AI professionals while switching jobs would be 40-50%, compared to 20-30% for other skills. 69888507 Paul said he is seeing more techies with 7-15 years of work experience going for the programme.""When we started, we thought the course would get working professionals with 5-7 years of experience, as they are early in their career. But surprisingly, the average is much higher. Sometimes we think that people who will want something are the people who have the most to gain, but actually people who want something are the ones who have the most to lose. These people have resources, but also have mortgages, children in schools/colleges and cannot afford to lose the lifestyle they have built over the years,"" he says. 69888508 Hari Krishnan Nair, co founder of training provider Great Learning, agrees. He says the rising interest from senior professionals looking to understand more about AI and its applications across industries has persuaded them to work on crafting a programme specifically for them. He says a lot of professionals are enrolling for such programmes because there are significant projects happening in their organisations around AI and they want to be a part of them.Another trend, Nair says, is the increase in enquiries for programmes in AI from school and college students. ""While their numbers aren't significant, they are clearly aware of AI playing a big role in their careers and want to be prepared,"" he says.V Rajanna, global head of the technology business unit in TCS, says technological advancements have historically reshaped skill requirements, but the pace at which today's next-generation technologies are developing and disrupting the global talent market is unprecedented.""Continuous competency enhancement at scale and speed is more paramount than ever before and has become a key success factor in this digital age,"" he says.","{'type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'android-app://com.toi.reader.activities/toi.index.deeplink/t/a/69883603'}"
