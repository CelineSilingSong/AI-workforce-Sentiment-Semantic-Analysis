After years of discussion, and seemingly little progress, the sudden boom of AI caught the majority of the population by surprise. 
Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of database, analytics, and machine learning (ML) at Amazon Web Services (AWS), believes this explosion of interest is due to the technology finally reaching its “tipping point.” AI and ML models are now at a level of sophistication and functionality at sufficient scale for value to be generated from their use. 
“Generative AI has captured our imagination,” Sivasubramanian says. “I believe it will transform every application, industry and business.”
Key to this advancement is the breakthrough in the variety of data that models can consume and the multiple outputs they can produce. Previously, ML algorithms would require highly specific or ‘labelled’ data to produce a defined output. 
I believe it will transform every application, industry and business
Now, foundational models (FMs) are trained using a wider range of information, and can produce a variety of complex outputs such as video or imagery. Crucially, FMs can be tuned to fit the requirements of an application or use case, reducing the time to market for new products or functionality.
“We can leverage massive amounts of complex data, to capture and present knowledge in more advanced ways, mapping complicated inputs to complicated outputs,” says Sivasubramanian. “What used to take months of scientists developing a machine learning model for one task can now be done relatively easily with one model and fine tuning.”
Every business sector can reap the benefits of these advancements. For example, an ability to generate video, audio and written content at speed can help enhance worker efficiency across many functions of an organisation. And customer experience could be improved through higher-quality chatbot interactions. 
Generative AI could have truly transformative capabilities in accelerating time to market in key research and development sectors, including health and life services and transportation. 
“The potential is huge,” says Phil Le Brun, enterprise strategist and evangelist at AWS. “Imagine pharmaceutical companies accelerating the design of gene therapies, borrowers having rich conversational experiences with mortgage providers that quickly approve their loans, or everyone everywhere gaining opportunities through broadening access to ongoing knowledge and educational pathways.”
AWS is helping its clients access these new capabilities through Amazon Bedrock, a cloud-based fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing FMs that offers access to generative AI applications through a single API. 





Amazon Bedrock features universally helpful applications such as fielding customer complaints through ‘AI agents’, leveraging existing company data without any manual input from human staff. Through Amazon QuickSight, data can be collated from across organisations, and generated into business intelligence reports from written language prompts, rapidly accelerating decision-making. For medical clients, AWS HealthScribe can automate paperwork through speech input, allowing doctors and nurses to spend more time treating their patients. 
Accessing these services through a single API offers massive potential for companies to work more efficiently, and produce innovative applications of their own at speed.
To make the most of these innovations, organisations must take some important steps. Sivasubramanian said companies must first ensure they have access to best-in-class FMs to leverage their apps and to build their own company’s capability. To do so, they will need a secure and private cloud-based environment, where they can customise models using their own data.
This should then allow companies to take the heavy lift away from staff, creating easy-to-use generative-AI-based tools that increase productivity. Finally, a machine-learning optimised infrastructure, which can be built at low cost and with low latency is vital. Le Brun stresses the role of the cloud in delivering these pillars of success. 
“Do you remember those TV programmes you used to watch as children, the ones that warned: ‘Don’t try this at home’? I’d give a variant of this warning with generative AI: ‘Don’t try this without the cloud,’” he says. 




“The cloud is the enabler for generative AI, making available cost-effective data lakes, sustainably provisioned GPUs and compute, high-speed networking, and consumption-based costing.”
The cloud is the enabler for generative AI
Le Brun also says that companies should address their data management before undertaking a generative AI strategy, as siloed or fragmented information will stymie their adoption. Leaders will have to address the company’s values to ensure that the technology is used in a way that benefits stakeholders at every level of the organisation.
“The world of generative AI is incredibly exciting, but technology rarely operates in a vacuum,” Le Brun says. “Face the law of unintended consequences. Start by considering your stance on ethics, transparency, data attribution, security, and privacy with AI. How can you ensure the technology is used accurately, fairly, and appropriately?”
Sivasubramanian says the widespread adoption of FMs should democratise the use of generative AI throughout an organisation. If these steps are achieved, leaders should be able to achieve that goal, while also rapidly scaling innovations that drive value for their customers and shareholders.

2023 was the year of artificial intelligence. 
There were certainly highs around the technology — companies rapidly deployed AI tools to speed up work processes, new capabilities were unlocked, and unique roles around AI were created. 
But, there were also some major lows. As people began using generative AI over the past year, some serious mistakes were made, which serve as a stark reminder that this generative tech — and our ability to utilize it — is still very much in its infancy, albeit not for long.
“There are companies who are excited and launching things, and maybe it’s a bit of a trial and error approach of ‘let’s see what happens,’” said Karthik Ramakrishnan, CEO and cofounder of Armilla AI, an insurance policy platform for AI blunders. “Sometimes it’s ‘what am I even protecting against? What will happen?’ If we don’t know those scenarios, people might take that approach.”
However in other cases, these blunders are calming people’s concerns that AI will take over because it shows there is still a long way to go.

“One shouldn’t use AI for AI’s sake,” said Ramakrishnan. “Let’s make sure there’s a true value proposition, a business case where AI can actually solve tough problems.”







            “One shouldn’t use AI for AI's sake.”        


 

                Karthik Ramakrishnan, CEO and cofounder of Armilla AI.            







Not everyone followed such sound judgment though. We compiled a list of the six biggest generative AI blunders in the past year to find out what actually went wrong. Here they are:

1. Sports Illustrated uses AI-generated authors and articles
The media industry is still navigating the best way to use AI, but this trial really missed the mark. In November, Sports Illustrated made headlines for publishing articles written by fake AI-generated authors, Drew (who spends a lot of time outdoors) and Sora (a fitness guru). Those biographies, along with their photos, were created by AI. You can find their photos available on sites selling AI-generated headshots. 
Sports Illustrated deleted several articles from its website after being outed by a report published by Futurism. 
The Arena Group, the publisher of Sports Illustrated, announced in December that its board of directors terminated its CEO, Ross Levinsohn. The Arena Group issued a statement explaining that the articles with the AI-generated headshots had been provided by a contractor called AdVon Commerce. They disputed the claim that the articles themselves had been AI-generated.
2. Fake AI-generated women on tech conference agenda
What’s worse: the fact this conference couldn’t possibly find one woman in tech to speak or the fact they decided to make someone up in the meantime?
According to the Associated Press, DevTernity organizer Eduards Sizovs admitted on social media that one of the featured speakers was an “auto-generated” woman with a fake title. He was responding to allegations about a number of suspicious profiles on his conference websites that appeared to be generated by AI.
But he denied that the fake profile was intended to mask the “worse-than-expected level of diversity of speakers” in this year’s lineup and refused to apologize in a series of posts on X, formerly Twitter.
It led to tech executives at Microsoft and Amazon to drop out of the conference, which was planned for Dec. 7.
3. Fake citations from ChatGPT used by an attorney
In May, the news broke that Steven Schwartz will be charged in a New York court for using fake citations from OpenAI’s ChatGPT in legal research for a case he was handling.
The cases ChatGPT presented the lawyer in his research were Varghese v. China South Airlines, Martinez v. Delta Airlines, Shaboon v. EgyptAir, Petersen v. Iran Air, Miller v. United Airlines, and Estate of Durden v. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines — all bogus. These cases did not exist and had fake judicial warnings.
“One of the worst AI blunders we saw this year was the case where lawyers used ChatGPT to create legal briefs without checking any of its work,” said Stanley Seibert, senior director of community innovation at data science platform Anaconda. “It is a pattern we will see repeated as users unfamiliar with AI assume it is more accurate than it really is. Even skilled professionals can be duped by AI ‘hallucinations’ if they don’t critically evaluate the output of ChatGPT and other generative AI tools.”
Examples like this show the need for industry-specific generative AI tools, like Harvey, which builds custom large language models for law firms to tackle their legal challenges.
4. An automated poll appeared on an MSN article about a woman who was found dead
Another attempt by the news industry to take advantage of AI fell completely short and somewhat tarnished the industry’s reputation around using new tools like AI. 
The Guardian sent an angry email to Microsoft after an automated poll appeared on an MSN/Guardian article about a woman who was found dead. The poll asked: What do you think is the reason behind the woman’s death? The choices were murder, accident, and suicide. 
Microsoft removed the poll that was embedded in its own version of the story, but the string of comments remains. 
MSN is known for using AI to generate a lot of its articles. It landed in hot water after an AI headline dubbed the late Brandon Hunter as “useless at 42” following the NBA star’s sudden death. 
Microsoft has been quietly removing poorly written AI articles from its site for some time now. Business Insider reported that in August, the company removed one MSN piece that listed a food bank in Ottawa as a tourist attraction.
5. Uber Eats began using AI-generated food images
Take care when ordering takeouts. Uber Eats is using AI for pictures of food when none are provided by the restaurant but the tech couldn’t tell the difference when the same term — “medium pie” — was used to describe a pizza at an Italian restaurant and a sweet dessert. In the same example, it invented a brand of ranch dressing called “Lelnach” and showed a bottle of that in the picture. 
“Your brand and reputation takes a hit,” said Ramakrishnan. “Yes, it didn’t harm anyone, but it did harm the company. There are many types of damages with AI — economic, societal, but there is also reputational harm. Will there be legal consequences to that? No, but then you’re like ‘is this food really real? Will it actually look like this when I get it?’ You start questioning everything, and your brand reputation goes down as a result.”
6. Samsung employees paste confidential source code into ChatGPT
Technology manufacturer Samsung banned its employees from using ChatGPT after engineers leaked confidential elements of the company’s source code into the chatbot. Employees leaked sensitive data on three separate occasions, emphasizing the importance of training your employees to be aware of what kind of data they are putting into generative AI models.
“It’s very difficult for some companies to understand their data and figure out what’s sensitive,” said Sarah Hospelhorn, CMO at software firm BigID. “But everyone wants to take advantage of the latest tech to show innovation. But if you’re using sets with unknown data, you’re amplifying risks.”







            ""Everyone wants to take advantage of the latest tech to show innovation. But if you’re using sets with unknown data, you’re amplifying risks.”        


 

                Sarah Hospelhorn, CMO at BigID.             







It’s one reason why BigID published the course “How to Accelerate AI Initiatives,” that shared what organizations need to do to adopt AI responsibly, from governing LLMs to prevent data leaks, to avoiding non-compliance and reducing risks associated with employing generative AI usage.
“It’s becoming more and more important,” said Hospelhorn. “We’re seeing it as the top priority for 2024 in terms of how teams are going to handle security around AI so that everyone can take advantage of the latest technology.”

In 2023, artificial intelligence (AI) truly entered our daily lives. The latest data shows four in five teenagers in the United Kingdom are using generative AI tools. About two-thirds of Australian employees report using generative AI for work.
At first, many people used these tools because they were curious about generative AI or wanted to be entertained. Now, people ask generative AI for help with studies, for advice, or use it to find or synthesise information. Other uses include getting help coding and making images, videos, or audio. 
So-called “prompt whisperers” or prompt engineers offer guides on not just designing the best AI prompts, but even how to blend different AI services to achieve fantastical outputs.
AI uses and functions have also shifted over the past 12 months as technological development, regulation and social factors have shaped what’s possible. Here’s where we’re at, and what might come in 2024.

AI changed how we work and pray
Generative AI made waves early in the year when it was used to enter and even win photography competitions, and tested for its ability to pass school exams.
ChatGPT, the chatbot that’s become a household name, reached a user base of 100 million by February – about four times the size of Australia’s population. 
Some musicians used AI voice cloning to create synthetic music that sounds like popular artists, such as Eminem. Google launched its chatbot, Bard. Microsoft integrated AI into Bing search. Snapchat launched MyAI, a ChatGPT-powered tool that allows users to ask questions and receive suggestions.
GPT-4, the latest iteration of the AI that powers ChatGPT, launched in March. This release brought new features, such as analysing documents or longer pieces of text.
Also in March, corporate giants like Coca-Cola began generating ads partly through AI, while Levi’s said it would use AI for creating virtual models. The now-infamous image of the Pope wearing a white Balenciaga puffer jacket went viral. A cohort of tech evangelists also called for an AI development pause.

Amazon began integrating generative AI tools into its products and services in April. Meanwhile, Japan ruled there would be no no copyright restrictions for training generative AI in the country. 
In the United States, screenwriters went on strike in May, demanding a ban of AI-generated scripts. Another AI-generated image, allegedly of the Pentagon on fire, went viral.
In July, worshippers experienced some of the first religious services led by AI. 
In August, two months after AI-generated summaries became available in Zoom, the company faced intense scrutiny for changes to its terms of service around consumer data and AI. The company later clarified its policy and pledged not to use customers’ data without consent to train AI.
In September, voice and image functionalities came to ChatGPT for paid users. Adobe began integrating generative AI into its applications like Illustrator and Photoshop.
By December, we saw an increased shift to “Edge AI”, where AI processes are handled locally, on devices themselves, rather than in the cloud, which has benefits in contexts when privacy and security are paramount. Meanwhile, the EU announced the world’s first “AI Law”.

Where to from here?
Given the whirlwind of AI developments in the past 12 months, we’re likely to see more incremental changes in the next year and beyond.
In particular, we expect to see changes in these four areas.
Increased bundling of AI services and functions
ChatGTP was initially just a chatbot that could generate text. Now, it can generate text, images and audio. Google’s Bard can now interface among Gmail, Docs and Drive, and complete tasks across these services.
By bundling generative AI into existing services and combining functions, companies will try to maintain their market share and make AI services more intuitive, accessible and useful. 
At the same time, bundled services make users more vulnerable when inevitable data breaches happen.
Higher quality, more realistic generations
Earlier this year, AI struggled with rendering human hands and limbs. By now, AI generators have markedly improved on these tasks.
At the same time, research has found how biased many AI generators can be. 
Some developers have created models with diversity and inclusivity in mind. Companies will likely see a benefit in providing services that reflect the diversity of their customer bases.
Growing calls for transparency and media standards
Various news platforms have been slammed in 2023 for producing AI-generated content without transparently communicating this. 
AI-generated images of world leaders and other newsworthy events abound on social media, with high potential to mislead and deceive. 
Media industry standards that transparently and consistently denote when AI has been used to create or augment content will need to be developed to improve public trust.
Expansion of sovereign AI capacity
In these early days, many have been content playfully exploring AI’s possibilities. However, as these AI tools begin to unlock rapid advancements across all sectors of our society, more fine-grained control over who governs these foundational technologies will become increasingly important.
In 2024, we will likely see future-focused leaders incentivising the development of their sovereign capabilities through increased research and development funding, training programs and other investments.
For the rest of us, whether you’re using generative AI for fun, work, or school, understanding the strengths and limitations of the technology is essential for using it in responsible, respectful and productive ways. 
Similarly, understanding how others – from governments to doctors – are increasingly using AI in ways that affect you, is equally important.

I was recently at a dinner party where another guest asked me to explain what I do for work. When I mentioned that part of my job involves thought leadership around digital trends like generative AI, the first comment was, “Wow, you must be busy this year.”
It’s a natural conclusion to come to: Even for those of us who don’t work with emerging technologies day to day, the speed at which headlines come out means it’s been almost impossible to avoid conversations and debates about the rise of generative AI. Applications like ChatGPT have become household names in the same way “to Google” has become a household verb. Adobe Photoshop now includes a “generative fill” option to let AI take a pass at edits.
According to research sponsored by Iron Mountain, 93% of organizations are already using generative AI in one way or another. In under a year, generative AI has secured a spot as a defining element in the technological zeitgeist. To borrow the cliche being used in newscasts around the world, Pandora’s box is open, and we’re well past the point of trying to close it.
Iron Mountain
Based on global research with 700 IT and data decision-makers conducted by Vanson Bourne, sponsored by Iron Mountain, October 2023.
New ways to get answers
In the same way that my current generation of young professionals learned to search for immediate answers on the Internet, the next generation of young professionals in the workforce must know how to get the answers they need through generative AI prompt engineering. Since January, I’ve noticed my own first instinct shifting from looking up instructions on Google to asking ChatGPT for an answer – after all, with an increasing number of demands on workers’ days, software that can provide time-saving shortcuts is a welcome addition to the corporate toolkit.
I wanted to put the scope of ChatGPT’s on-the-job training to the test. Early on in my career, whenever I was responsible for setting up a meeting, I would “google” step-by-step instructions on how to accomplish that task. When I asked ChatGPT for the same information, it gave me an identical set of instructions – not totally surprising. Where ChatGPT got the edge was its ability to answer queries beyond my original question. What should I include in the body of the message? What’s the appropriate tone to take if it’s a call with my peers and my supervisor? Can you write a meeting description that fulfills the requirements listed above? In a matter of seconds, ChatGPT had written a professional and succinct meeting invite that would have taken me multiple revisions to get right.
Early literacy creates effective users
Starting in early elementary school, computer classes were a mandatory part of the curriculum. The expectation was that as soon as a student could read a sentence, Mavis Beacon would teach them how to type it into a word processor. When I started my first corporate job, digital literacy and applications like Microsoft Office were second nature because I’d had exposure to them throughout my entire education. The same can be true for generative AI; based on the number of resources available, specifically to train educators, it already is. The largest variable remains the question of how. How schools choose to introduce generative AI into their curriculums, as either a friend or foe, will make a difference in the way the next generations of professionals approach and engage with it. If a person is empowered to use generative AI for good, there’s no limit to the innovative ideas that can be fostered.
The adoption of generative AI tools is not and shouldn’t be limited to students; it needs to go beyond and be included as part of a robust workplace strategy. The value that generative AI holds at every level of work can’t be ignored or brushed under the rug. According to McKinsey, “Generative AI has the potential to change the anatomy of work…automating work activities that take up 60-70% of peoples’ time today.” AI is the solution to the increasing number of hours people spend on mind-numbing tasks. Reducing the amount of time spent on processes that can be automated empowers existing employees to focus on the jobs that they were hired to do without the weight of busy work.
Going forward with confidence
It’s important to look critically at new and developing technologies, especially in cases like generative AI that necessitate a discussion about ethical training and use. However, that doesn’t mean that organizations should create strategies that exclude or prevent usage. From both an education and enterprise perspective, students must be informed about the technology and the impact that implementing–or, conversely, not implementing–will have on businesses. Generative AI is here, and once new technology is introduced, it’s almost always here to stay. What will change is the way that jobs are performed and the people who have the skills to hold those jobs. In the wake of emerging technology, employees who are unable to adapt are going to be at a disadvantage as the next generation of professionals enter the workforce.
So, whether you’re building proficiency through a more formal education from a university or simply taking a professional development class from providers such as Coursera or LinkedIn, there are ways to stay ahead of the curve – and you may just find a new topic for discussion at your next dinner party.

Here's what can helpDec 20, 2023Around a fifth of workers in the US say they fear AI will make them obsolete, a phenomenon dubbed “FOBO”.Image: Unsplash/LukasKate WhitingSenior Writer, Forum AgendaShare:Our ImpactWhat's the World Economic Forum doing to accelerate action on Emerging Technologies?The Big PictureExplore and monitor how Artificial Intelligence is affecting economies, industries and global issuesCrowdsource InnovationGet involved with our crowdsourced digital platform to deliver impact at scaleStay up to date:Future of WorkFollowEmerging technologies including AI will disrupt jobs and employees’ skills in the coming years.Around a fifth of workers in the US say they fear AI will make them obsolete, a phenomenon dubbed “FOBO”.The World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs report finds that some roles will never be replaced and that AI will lead to job growth in some areas, while upskilling will be key.As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become increasingly advanced, many people have developed anxieties over the potential for AI to make human skills, jobs, or even the human species itself obsolete. This phenomenon has been dubbed “fear of obsolescence” or “FOBO” – the notion that we will create or evolve ourselves into irrelevance.Or, to put it another way …Imagine waking up one day and finding your job has been automated overnight by intelligent machines. Then you discover even the career you dreamed of pursuing next has already been mastered by AI. Quickly, more and more human domains once thought impossible to replicate – art, music, emotion – fall prey to advancing algorithms until all uniquely human talent and purpose dwindles in the face of superior robotic counterparts. Soon your very existence becomes trivial … unnecessary.Sounds terrifying, doesn’t it? But also, if we’re being honest, a little odd. That’s because none of the above was written by a human – AI wrote it. Claude.ai responded to a human prompt for an intro about FOBO (in the first paragraph) and then a refined prompt asking for it to be more creative and add some suspense (in the two above).Here’s what you actually need to know about the phenomenon.What is FOBO?FOBO is a real feeling – over a fifth of workers in the US are worried technology will make their jobs obsolete, according to a Gallup poll in September 2023.Workers’ fears over obsolescence are growing. Image: GallupIt’s not a new phenomenon. Gallup has been tracking the sentiment since 2017. But the fear has grown over the period between 2021 and 2023 – coinciding with generative AI going mainstream with the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022. While the number of workers without a college degree who expressed concern stayed almost unchanged at 24%, there was a rise in the number of worried college-educated workers – from 8% to 20%. Concern has also risen more in the younger generation – with an 11 percentage point change among those aged between 18 and 34.College graduates are growing more concerned about being replaced by AI. Image: GallupShould people be worried about AI taking their jobs?Is FOBO justified? It largely depends on the profession you’re in as to how many tasks can be automated, but humans will always need to be kept in the loop to some extent – with their work augmented by AI. Routine and repetitive tasks are the ones AI is most likely to automate, according to the World Economic Forum’s Jobs of Tomorrow whitepaper, whereas critical thinking and complex problem-solving could be augmented by the technology.Only 16.1% of an HR manager’s job, for example, shows potential for automation and 22.2% for augmentation, according to the report.But there are some roles AI will never be able to replace, and in fact, careers in agriculture, education and supply chain and logistics will likely see growth.Businesses are introducing automation into their operations more slowly than expected, according to the Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2023. Just over a third (34%) of all business-related tasks today are performed by machines, with the remaining 66% performed by humans. That’s only a 1% increase compared to the 2020 Future of Jobs Survey.DiscoverHow is the World Economic Forum creating guardrails for Artificial Intelligence? Show moreIn response to the uncertainties surrounding generative AI and the need for robust AI governance frameworks to ensure responsible and beneficial outcomes for all, the Forum’s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (C4IR) has launched the AI Governance Alliance. The Alliance will unite industry leaders, governments, academic institutions, and civil society organizations to champion responsible global design and release of transparent and inclusive AI systems. In fact, respondents lowered their expectations for future automation to predict that, by 2027, 42% of business tasks will be automated, down from a predicted 47% in the 2020 survey. Although AI is expected to lead to higher churn rates and three-quarters of companies are looking to adopt the technology, more businesses expect AI adoption to lead to job growth than job loss – at 50% and 25% respectively. Why upskilling will be crucial for the jobs of the futureIn the next five years, employees estimate that 44% of workers’ skills will be disrupted, meaning upskilling and life-long learning are now more essential, says the Future of Jobs Report 2023.The skills most in demand are those that AI can’t replace, including analytical thinking, empathy and active listening, and leadership and social influence.AI will also create new fields of work, with growing opportunities for: “trainers”, “explainers” and “sustainers”, the Forum’s white paper, Jobs of Tomorrow: Large Language Models and Jobs, found.When asked whether humans should fear AI taking their jobs, Anthropic’s Claude responded: “I have no independent desires to take jobs from humans or render anyone obsolete. I am designed solely to be assistive to human goals and values – not replace them … “I am only an interface focused on providing helpful information to you, not pushing any autonomous motivations. My role is to collaborate with human creativity as a tool – not rival or replace it.”Have you read?These are the jobs that AI can’t replaceWe often hear that AI will take our jobs.

In the year since OpenAI introduced the ChatGPT chatbot, generative artificial intelligence has burst into the public consciousness and jumped to the top of most corporate agendas.
Most companies and business leaders are still finding their way with this new technology, from understanding more about how generative AI works and how it will affect businesses and workers to anticipating how it will be regulated. There is also growing emphasis on how to make sure it is used responsibly.
Researchers at MIT Sloan have been examining generative AI and the best ways to use it in the enterprise. Here’s what they’ve found.
AI and workers 
Inexperienced workers stand to benefit the most from generative AI, according to research by MIT Sloan associate professor Danielle Li, MIT Sloan PhD candidate Lindsey Raymond, and Stanford University professor Erik Brynjolfsson, PhD ’91.

The researchers found that contact center agents with access to a conversational assistant saw a 14% boost in productivity, with the largest gains impacting new or low-skilled workers.
“Generative AI seems to be able to decrease inequality in productivity, helping lower-skilled workers significantly but with little effect on high-skilled workers,” Li said. “Without access to an AI tool, less-experienced workers would slowly get better at their jobs. Now they can get better faster.”
Generative AI can boost highly skilled workers’ productivity too, according to a research paper co-authored by MIT Sloan professor Kate Kellogg — though it has to be introduced the right way.
It is not always obvious to highly skilled knowledge workers which of their everyday tasks could easily be performed by AI, the researchers found. To introduce generative AI to highly skilled workers and boost productivity, organizations should establish a culture of accountability, reward peer training, and encourage role reconfiguration.
And MIT Sloan professor John J. Horton notes that several factors have to be in place for a human-AI interaction to be worthwhile. He recommends that leaders consider four points before swapping in AI for human labor: how much time the task will take without assistance, how much the employee performing a task is paid, whether AI is capable of performing the task correctly, and how easy it is for humans to determine whether the AI output is accurate. 
Generative AI could also help people get hired. Job applicants who were randomly assigned algorithmic assistance with their resumes — such as suggestions to improve spelling and grammar — were 8% more likely to be hired, according to an experiment conducted by Horton, MIT Sloan PhD student Emma van Inwegen, and MIT Sloan PhD student Zanele Munyikwa.
“If you take two identical workers with the same skills and background, the one with the better-written resume is more likely to get hired,” van Inwegen said. “The takeaway is that employers actually care about the writing in the resume — it’s not just a correlation.” That means that AI assistance can be a useful tool for those hoping to get hired, she said.
Using AI to the best advantage 
It’s time for everyone in your organization to understand generative AI, according to MIT Sloan senior lecturer George Westerman. In a webinar, he outlined early use cases, such as summarizing documents, creating personalized shopping experiments, and writing code. Generative AI is the latest in a line of advanced analytics tools, he noted, which vary in how much data and domain expertise is needed to use them, whether their results are repeatable, and how easy it is to understand how they generate results.
For businesses, using work generated by AI will depend in part on how consumers perceive that work. With this in mind, MIT Sloan senior lecturer and research scientist Renee Richardson Gosline and Yunhao Zhang SM ’20, PhD ’23, a postdoctoral fellow at the Psychology of Technology Institute, studied how people perceive work created by generative AI, humans, or some combination of the two.
They found that when people knew a product’s source, they expressed a positive bias toward content created by humans. Yet at the same time, and contrary to the traditional idea of “algorithmic aversion,” people did not express a negative bias toward AI-generated content when they knew how it was created. In fact, when respondents were not told how content was created, they preferred AI-generated content.

Users can make the most of generative AI by using it in concert with external tools to answer complex questions and execute actions. MIT Sloan professor of the practice Rama Ramakrishnan looked at how to use ChatGPT as an agent to do things like search the web, order groceries, purchase plane tickets, or send emails.
And businesses that find success with generative AI will also harness human-centric capabilities, such as creativity, curiosity, and compassion, according to MIT Sloan senior lecturer Paul McDonagh-Smith. The key is figuring out how humans and machines can best work together, resulting in humans’ abilities being multiplied, rather than divided, by machines’ capabilities, McDonagh-Smith said during a webinar.

It’s time to talk about how to rechart the course of technology so it complements human capabilities, according to MIT economists Daron Acemoglu and Simon Johnson. In their new book, “Power and Progress: Our Thousand-Year Struggle Over Technology and Prosperity,” they decry the economic and social damage caused by the concentrated power of business and show how the tremendous computing advances of the past half century can become empowering and democratizing tools.
“Society and its powerful gatekeepers need to stop being mesmerized by tech billionaires and their agenda,” they write in an excerpt from the book. “Debates on new technology ought to center not just on the brilliance of new products and algorithms but also on whether they are working for the people or against the people.”
In a policy memo co-authored with MIT professor David Autor, Acemoglu and Johnson suggested five policies that could steer AI implementation in a direction that complements humans and augments their skills. These include equalizing tax rates on employing workers and owning equipment or algorithms, updating Occupational Safety and Health Administration rules to create safeguards against worker surveillance, and creating an AI center of expertise within government.
When President Joe Biden issued an executive order in October on AI safety and security, one part of it addressed using content labels to identify content generated by artificial intelligence. A new working paper co-authored by MIT Sloan professor David Rand looked at the right terms to use for those labels. The researchers found that people associated certain terms, such as “AI generated” and “AI manipulated,” most closely with content created using AI. Conversely, the labels “deepfake” and “manipulated” were most associated with misleading content, whether AI created it or not.

As generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as DALL-E, MidJourney, and Stable Diffusion accumulate millions of registered users, the tools’ image-creation abilities have sparked waves of criticism. Some critics point to the use of AI to generate illegal and nonconsensual images. Others speak about theft of intellectual property, suggesting a kind of “automated plagiarism.” Image generators are trained on hundreds of thousands of images made by human creators. The Biden administration and the Group of Seven (G7) both affirm copyright protection as a fundamental requirement for trustworthy AI, but what this would mean for an artist whose work has been “stolen” to train these models remains murky at best.
The evolving landscape of generative AI reveals shortcomings in current copyright regulations, including outdated notions of intellectual property and compensation as well as undue burdens on creators. The solution needs to be rooted in collective negotiation and international consensus.

Brushstrokes and pixels

What is art? Plato held that art is imitation. Indian philosopher Bharata described rasa (flavor) in art. In contemporary philosophy, there are numerous aesthetic definitions, which define qualities inherent to the art, as well as disjunctive definitions, such as where art is a product of the aesthetic of its time or is part of a recognized tradition or institution. In other words, there is no one definition of art, leading some proponents of AI art to argue that anything we deem to be art becomes art.
However, can something be art if there is no artist? Critics and proponents of AI art agree on one thing—there needs to be a human holding the brush. As computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum famously wrote in 1976: “No other organism, and certainly no computer, can be made to confront genuine human problems in human terms.” Last year an AI-generated entry won the Colorado state fair’s fine arts competition in the “digitally manipulated art” category. The winner, who had never dabbled in art before the advent of generative AI, said that AI “is a tool, just like the paintbrush is a tool. Without the person, there is no creative force.”

Neurons and code

The principles published by the G7 after its May 2023 meeting in Hiroshima began with this preface: “Different jurisdictions may take their own unique approaches to implementing these actions in different ways.” Indeed, countries’ approaches to the emerging question of “authorship” where human beings are not necessarily involved fall along a bewildering spectrum. The US Copyright Office only grants copyright to “works created by human beings.” Famously, in the 2018 case of a selfie taken by a crested macaque named Naruto using the camera of photographer David Slater, a US court declared that non-humans do not have statutory standing under the Copyright Act. However, according to the Copyright Office, works created through text prompts and lacking any further creative input by the human user, as in the case of generative AI tools, would not be copyrightable because “these prompts function more like instructions to a commissioned artist.”
China’s draft rules on generative AI, released in April, require that these services and products respect intellectual property rights, both at a commercial and personal level. The wording is broad—perhaps excessively so. It requires generative AI service providers to ensure their models meet legal requirements and would likely require a new licensing architecture for data mining. Chinese copyright law recognizes individuals and organizations (leaning heavily toward companies), but not “entities” like AI models, as copyright holders. It recognizes the rights of adaptation and compilation—the right to transform a work and arrange existing ones—but also requires publishers of such adapted work to compensate the authors of the original. As in the US case, this approach leaves some gray area for generative AI systems, depending on whether a generated work is viewed as an adaptation with sufficient original input. Interestingly, in 2020, a Shenzhen court ruled that an AI-generated news article qualified for copyright protection, as it met the threshold for originality.
According to India’s Copyright Act, the “author” of a copyrightable work is, “in relation to any literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work which is computer-generated, the person who causes the work to be created.” According to a July 2023 report by New Delhi law firm Ikigai Law, “In India, a work must involve a minimum degree of creativity and not be a product of only skill and labor. Output produced by AI tools may not satisfy the requirement of ‘creativity’ required for copyright protection, if they are viewed as a collection of data compiled from already existing sources without any infusion of creativity.” In this sense, Indian and US copyright law agree that a certain class of AI-generated works would not qualify for copyright.
Japan is tackling the gray area generated by foundational models as well. In July and September, the Japanese Agency for Cultural Affairs convened panels to deliberate the required threshold for “creative contributions” of human authors. At the same time, the government has stated that Japanese copyright will not protect holders/creators of data used for AI training.
All these regulatory measures are grappling with the fact that, counterintuitively, generative AI is not always a “tool,” and there can be cases where the AI is doing most of the creative “labor,” albeit by drawing upon the creative output of hundreds of thousands of human artists. On top of that, the sheer size of datasets used to train image generators makes it difficult for individuals to prove copyright infringement (not to mention that many artists who post their work online do not register copyright). In a recent federal court ruling in California, the presiding judge dismissed a class action lawsuit by three artists against DeviantArt, an online art community, and MidJourney. The ruling stated that it would be impossible for the defendants to audit every single image in the database for potential copyright infringement (complicated by the fact that the database in question, LAION, is open-source), and it is difficult for an artist to prove a generated image is derived from their work, absent “substantial similarity.”

Unregulatable AI?

Generative AI is certainly unlike any paintbrush humans have used before. It is only as “creative” as the artists whose works were fed into the model, but also, as some countries’ positions imply, reflects the creative vision of the person who uses it.
Scrolling through the nearly ten thousand public comments received by the Copyright Office as part of its AI study (a task for which an AI assistant would have been welcome), the common themes that emerge are consent and compensation. As one commenter states: “As an artist, I never gave permission for AI to regurgitate my work. I was never asked if it would be all right with me.”
What further complicates copyright is that these laws are national in scope, whereas datasets are not. And as the analysis above has shown, different jurisdictions are approaching this issue in divergent ways (if they are at all). Therefore, it is wholly possible that if certain countries impose rules that are seen as harsh by companies, they can relocate their operations to safer havens.
Copyright collectives or copyright societies offer one potential lifeline for artists. This has been a model for collective negotiation of multiple works, where the collective negotiates copyright and compensation on behalf of a group. However, in the internet age, such collectives would need to be international in scope, or part of a network of collectives. They would also need to lower their membership fees, which many artists—who publish their works online in good faith and with no expectation of remuneration—would not be able to afford.
Another potential pathway is the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, which 181 countries have signed onto. While the convention is limited by the copyright laws of the nations that are party to it, it can serve as a forum for countries to agree to a baseline set of protections for artists with regard to companies building generative AI models.
As generative AI becomes more advanced and widely accessible, and is applied in unexpected ways, it has become quite evident that current copyright law—which often places undue onus on those whose work is being used without their consent—offers inadequate solutions. Any tenable resolution to the challenge posed by generative AI to copyright would need collective bargaining and international buy-in.

Infusion of generative AI into analytics a work in progress


Many vendors have introduced tools that integrate LLM technology with their platforms, but most are still refining the tools to ensure their accuracy and security.

Published: 18 Dec 2023


 
The integration between generative AI and analytics remains under development.
Many vendors have unveiled plans to enable customers to query and analyze data using conversational language rather than code or business-specific natural language processing (NLP) capabilities.







In addition, many have also introduced AI assistants that users can ask for help while executing various tasks and tools that automatically summarize and explain data products such as reports, dashboards and models.
Some have also introduced SQL generation features that reduce the coding requirements needed to model data and automated tools that offer suggestions as developers build data products.
Sisense was perhaps the first analytics vendor to reveal plans to integrate its platform with generative AI (GenAI) capabilities, introducing an integration with OpenAI -- developer of ChatGPT -- in January 2023. Two months later, ThoughtSpot unveiled Sage, a tool that combined the vendor's existing natural language search capabilities with large language model (LLM) capabilities to enable conversational language interactions with data.
By summer, Tableau and Qlik were among the vendors that had introduced generative AI plans. In addition, tech giants AWS, Google and Microsoft -- developers of analytics platforms QuickSight, Looker and Power BI, respectively -- were all working to add generative AI to their BI tools.
But as the end of 2023 nears, most analytics vendors' generative AI capabilities are still in some stage of development and have not yet been made generally available.
There are exceptions.
For example, MicroStrategy in October made NLP and text-to-code translation capabilities generally available. Similarly, Domo in August released NLP and AI model management capabilities as part of its Domo AI suite.
Most others, however, are still being refined, according to David Menninger, an analyst at Ventana Research.
""There are some that are available today, but the majority are still in preview,"" he said.
Perhaps the main reason for the holdup is that it's difficult to take a new technology and make it one of the most significant parts of a platform.
It takes time to get it right, and vendors are attempting to get it right before they release tools to the public, according to Sumeet Arora, ThoughtSpot's chief development officer. Before releasing tools, vendors need to make sure responses to natural language queries are accurate and the data organizations load into analytics tools that are integrating with LLMs remains private and secure.
""The most difficult technical problem is how to leverage GenAI to answer natural language questions with 100% accuracy in the enterprise. That is not a straightforward problem,"" Arora said.
He noted that OpenAI's GPT-4 and Google's Gemini answer questions with just under 80% accuracy.
""That is not good enough in analytics,"" Arora said. ""The question is how to get to 100% accuracy in analytics. That has been the journey of the last year.""

Seven benefits of generative AI for the enterprise.






The promise
There are two big reasons so many vendors have made generative AI a focal point of product development.
One is the potential to expand BI use within organizations beyond a small group of highly trained users. The other is the possibility of making existing data experts more efficient. Both come down the simplification of previously complex processes, according to Francois Ajenstat, now the chief product officer at digital analytics platform vendor Amplitude after 13 years at Tableau.
""GenAI really drives radical simplicity in the user experience,"" he said. ""It will open up analytics to a wider range of people and it will enable better analysis by doing a lot of the hard work on their behalf so they can get to the insights faster and focus on what matters.""
Analytics use has been stuck for more than a decade, according to studies.
Because BI platforms are complicated, requiring coding skills for many tasks and necessitating data literacy training even for low-code/no-code tools aimed at self-service users, only about a quarter of employees within organizations use analytics as a regular part of their job.
Generative AI can change that by enabling true conversational interactions with data.
Many vendors developed their own NLP capabilities in recent years. But those NLP tools had limited vocabularies. They required highly specific business phrasing to understand queries and generate relevant responses.
The generative AI platforms developed by OpenAI, Google, Hugging Face and others have LLMs trained with extensive vocabularies and eliminated at least some of the data literacy training required by previous NLP tools.
Meanwhile, by reducing the need to code, generative AI tools can make trained data workers more efficient.
Developing data pipelines that feed data products takes copious amounts of time-consuming coding. Text-to-code translation capabilities enable data workers to use conversational language to write commands that get translated to code. They greatly reduce time-consuming tasks and free data workers to do other things.
MicroStrategy and AWS are among the vendors that have introduced generative AI tools that enable natural language query and analysis. They also released capabilities that automatically summarize and explain data.
In addition, Qlik with Staige and Domo with Domo AI -- along with a spate of data management vendors -- are among those that have gone further and introduced text-to-code translation capabilities.
Ultimately, one of the key reasons analytics vendors are developing so many generative AI tools is the promise of improved communication, according to Donald Farmer, founder and principal of TreeHive Strategy.
""The most obvious [benefit of generative AI] is that it has an ability to communicate what it finds,"" Farmer said. ""Ninety percent of the problem of analytics is explaining your answers to people or getting people to understand what has been discovered.""
Two more benefits -- perhaps geared more toward developers and data engineers -- are its intuitiveness related to data integration and its ability to generate test code to help develop algorithms, Farmer added.
With respect to the generative AI capabilities themselves, some vendors are experimenting a bit more radically than others.
NLP, AI assistants and text-to-code translation capabilities are the most common features that vendors have introduced to simplify data preparation and analysis. Others, however, represent the cutting edge.
Menninger cited Tableau Pulse, a tool that learns Tableau users' behavior to automatically surface relevant insights, as something beyond what most vendors so far have publicly revealed. In addition, he noted that some vendors are working on features that automate tasks such as metadata creation and data cataloging that otherwise take significant time and manual effort.
""The cutting edge is metadata awareness and creation, building a semantic model with little or no intervention by the user,"" Menninger said. ""Take away NLP and the other great value of GenAI is automation. It can automate various steps that have been obstacles to analytics success in the past.""
Farmer, meanwhile, named Microsoft Copilot, Amazon Q from AWS and Duet AI from Google as the comprising the current cutting edge.
Unlike analytics specialists whose tools deal only with analyzing data, the tech giants have the advantage of managing an entire data ecosystem and thus gaining deep understanding of a particular business. Their generative AI tools, therefore, are being integrated not only with BI tools but also data management, supply chain management, customer service and other tools.
""The stuff that looks most interesting is the copilot stuff -- the idea of AI as something that is there in everything you do and absolutely pervasive,"" Farmer said. ""It's only the big platform people that can do that.""


The delay
Often, after tools are unveiled in preview, it takes only a few months for vendors to make whatever alterations are needed and release the tools to the public.
That hasn't been the case with generative AI capabilities.
For example, Sage was introduced by ThoughtSpot nine months ago and is not yet generally available. It was in private preview for a couple of months and then moved to public preview. But the vendor is still working to make sure it's enterprise-ready.
Similarly, Tableau unveiled Tableau GPT and Tableau Pulse in May, but both are still in preview. The same is true of Microsoft's Copilot in Power BI, Google's Duet AI in Looker and Spotfire's Copilot, among many other generative AI tools.
At the core of ensuring generative AI tools are enterprise ready are accuracy, data privacy and data security, as noted by Arora.
AI hallucinations -- incorrect responses -- have been an ongoing problem for LLMs. In addition, their security is suspect, and they have been susceptible to data breaches.
Reducing incorrect responses takes training, which is what vendors are now doing, according to Arora.
He noted that by working with customers using Sage in preview, ThoughtSpot has been able to improve Sage's accuracy to over 95% by combining generative AI with human training.
""What we have figured out is that it takes a human-plus-AI approach to get to accuracy,"" Arora said. ""ThoughtSpot is automatically learning the business language of the organization. But we have made sure that there is human input into how the business language is being interpreted by the data.""
A formula that seems to result in the highest level of accuracy from Sage -- up to 98%, according to Arora -- is to first roll the tool out to power users within an organization for a few weeks. Those power users are able to train Sage to some degree so the tool begins to understand the business.
Then, after those few weeks, Sage's use can be expanded to more users.



The most difficult technical problem is how to leverage GenAI to answer natural language questions with 100% accuracy in the enterprise. That is not a straightforward problem.

""There is no easy button for GenAI,"" Arora said. ""But there is a flow that if you follow, you can get amazing results. Once the system is properly used by the power users and data analysts, it becomes ready for prime time.""
But there's more to the lag time between introducing generative AI analytics capabilities and their general availability than just concerns and risks related to accuracy, security and privacy, according to Ajenstat.
Generative AI represents a complete shift for analytics vendors.
It has been less than 13 months since OpenAI released ChatGPT, a significant improvement in generative AI and LLM capabilities.
Before then, some analytics vendors offered traditional AI and machine learning capabilities but not generative AI. Once ChatGPT was released, the ways it could make data workers more efficient while enabling more people within organizations to use analytics tools were clear.
But truly integrating the technologies -- ensuring accurate natural language query responses, training chatbots to be able to assist as customers use various tools, and putting governance measures in place to guarantee data privacy and security -- takes time.
""The speed of adoption of ChatGPT took the technology industry by storm,"" Ajenstat said. ""We realized this is a tectonic plate shifting in the landscape where everyone will lean into it. As a result of that, we're at the peak of the hype cycle. That's exciting. It also means there are a lot of ideas.""
Getting the ideas from the planning stage to the production stage, however, is not a simple, quick process, he continued.
In particular, analytics vendors need to make sure users can trust their generative AI tools.
""We see the potential, but can users trust the results?"" Ajenstat said. ""There's also trust in terms of the training data -- sending it to [a third party]. There's trust in terms of bias and ethics. There's a lot below the surface that technology providers and the industry as a whole have to figure out to make sure we're delivering great products that actually solve customers' problems.""
Beyond the difficulty related to getting tools ready for enterprise-level consumption, the speed of generative AI innovation is delaying the release of some capabilities, according to Farmer.
He noted that once a feature is made generally available, a vendor is making a commitment to that feature. They're committing to improve it with updates, offer support to users and so forth. But because generative AI is now evolving so quickly, vendors are unsure whether some of the capabilities they've revealed in preview are the ones they want to commit to long term.
""If you come out with an enterprise product, you're committed to supporting it over the lifetime of an enterprise product,"" Farmer said. ""It's really difficult to say something is stable enough and complete enough and supportable enough to build an enterprise agreement around it.""


The future
The natural language query capabilities, AI assistants and summarization tools that many analytics vendors are developing -- and a few have made generally available -- are the first generation of generative AI capabilities.
At a certain point, perhaps during the first half of 2024, most will be ready for widespread use. At that point, vendors will turn their attention to a different set of generative AI features, which will represent a second generation.
Process automation might be a primary theme of that second generation after simplification was the primary theme of the first generation, according to Ajenstat.
""It will be interesting to see how long we stay in the first generation because we haven't actually gotten the mass adoption there,"" he said. ""But for me, the next phase is going to be about automation. It will be using generative AI as an agent that can automate tasks on your behalf, augmenting the human by removing some of the drudgery that's out there.""
Arora likewise predicted that task automation will mark the next generation of generative AI, eventually followed by systems themselves becoming autonomous.
Many of the tasks needed to inform natural language queries such as data curation and defining metrics still require manual effort, he noted. But automation of those data preparation tasks is coming.
As for when those automation capabilities will be in production, Arora predicted it could be as early as the second half of 2024 and early 2025.
""Users will be able to connect to a data system and then start asking questions,"" Arora said. ""The system will automatically define metrics, automatically find the right data tables and answer questions with accuracy. There will be complete automation.""
Similarly, Menninger cited automation as a likely centerpiece of the next phase of generative AI development. However, he said automation will go beyond merely reducing the drudgery of data preparation.
Menninger expects that the first-generation tools now under development will be available by the end of the first half of next year. Vendors will then not simply turn their attention to automation but turn their attention to the automation of AI.
Generative AI is not the same as AI, Menninger noted. It is not predictive analytics. It still takes the rare expertise of data scientists and PhDs to train data and develop AI models that can do predictive analysis.
However, generative AI can eventually be trained to create AI models.
""In the same way GenAI can now generate SQL code, we're going to get to a point where GenAI can generate predictive models that are of a high enough quality that we can rely on them,"" Menninger said. ""And if they're not of a high enough quality, they'll be close enough that we can at least have more productivity around creating AI models.""
He added that research from ISG -- now Ventana's parent company -- shows that the number one problem organizations have developing AI models is a lack of skills.
""To the extent we can use GenAI to overcome that skills gap, that's what the future is about.""

Generative AI and Personalization won’t work without a Customer Data Operations Strategy
December 18, 2023


At the recent AWS re:Invent sessions, you couldn’t go anywhere without hearing about Generative AI. There was also a ton of focus on elevating experiences and personalization. What I heard less about is the importance of the quality of underlying data in making cutting edge AI or personalization tools actually work. And that’s a huge mistake.
Data quality isn’t nearly as sexy as Generative AI, but if you don’t get the input right, that magical-seeming output will be wrong. Building and iterating custom models is extremely expensive – do you want to waste time and resources building models on bad inputs? What good is the ability to customize outreach emails if the data is inaccurate? How useful is it to generate marketing messages at scale or send well-timed push notifications if the details are wrong?
The tricky thing is, “good data” isn’t a static thing. For consumer brands, it requires an ongoing end-to-end management of workflows that turn raw customer data into a valuable and usable asset to fuel customer engagement teams and tools. I like to think of it as “customer data operations.”
Unfortunately, this isn’t as easy as it sounds, and it’s more involved than many believe it to be (or than most customer data tool vendors make it out to be).

Data unification and use is not set-and-forget — it takes upkeep
Unifying customer data is a complex challenge because of the sheer volume and diversity of data points, the fragmentation of data across different siloed systems, and the lack of standardization in how data is collected.
On top of all that, customer lives are dynamic and constantly evolving, with changes in demographics, interests, and behaviors often not explicitly captured in the data you collect. This is to say nothing of the ever increasing diversity of places where this data needs to be collected as new channels continue to proliferate.
What this means is that building and maintaining unified customer profiles is not “one and done.” It’s hard enough to set up a unified customer view, but even when you accomplish that it’s only the beginning.
First is the resource-intensive job of creating a foundational customer data asset, which includes:

Ingesting data
Resolving known (key-based) identities
Resolving identities for “everything else” (the data without linking keys)
Modeling the customer data
Shaping the customer data
Building data workflows

Then you need to maintain steady-state functioning for that foundational asset, which involves:

Data quality control
Updating data assets and transformations as upstream data evolves
Monitoring workflows
Handling compliance obligations, including rights to erasure
Error resolution
Data governance

Finally, if any new data sources or downstream destinations are introduced, there needs to be a thorough process for change management, including a safe environment to test workflows so nothing breaks in production and causes costly downtime.
If there’s one thing you should take away from this article, it’s the scope and complexity of keeping your data working for you.
If you want to dig deeper, read on. I’ll lay out the elements in greater detail, along with common approaches and why they fall short.

Customer identity is difficult and specialized
Resolving identities and unifying customer data into a usable asset is time-consuming, expensive, and leaves room for error as new and often conflicting data enters the mix. But this is the critical first step toward getting all the rest of marketing and analytics to work properly — if you don’t do this right, you end up feeding downstream tools and processes with inaccurate and incomplete data.
Things get time-consuming when your approach uses custom match-merge to do identity resolution that’s slow, inaccurate, and difficult to maintain, as with legacy approaches like those in MDM or ETL solutions. Running this also requires teams to take data workflows down, often for weeks at a time.
It gets expensive if you’re outsourcing identity resolution to providers that rely on third-party data signals, which costs more and performs poorly due to rapidly deteriorating third-party fidelity. If your approach involves doing identity resolution in your data warehouse, it requires spending computing credits and the costs increase exponentially over time.
As for errors, there are common problems that lead to inaccuracies and profile collapse with both a composable CDP (Customer Data Platform) approach and packaged CDPs. When performing deterministic matching in a data warehouse, as with a naive “composable” approach, identity becomes inaccurate as PII data changes over time, and profiles aren’t guaranteed to be stable. When using a typical CDP in-product identity resolution with deterministic & probabilistic matching, quality suffers whenever the platform drops historical data. And third-party-augmented identity resolution isn’t just expensive as mentioned above, it’s also becoming less and less accurate as cookies are phased out and privacy regulations evolve. 

Data needs are constantly changing
Business users constantly ask for fast access to new data sources and insights that require extensive data modeling and governance, often across multiple systems. Adding a new data source and then using that data to build an attribute and generate insights is a lot of work.
There’s significant data mapping from system to system so each knows what the new data field is, where it should live on a profile, and who to make that data point available to. This is where data engineers waste a lot of time on profile maintenance, and is a common problem with reverse ETL tools that need to be given permission to view datasets, tables, or views for every change. For example, you may have a customer table that has ten fields, each representing a different attribute. If you add an eleventh column, a reverse ETL vendor would not automatically expose it, since these tools only expose and track changes in columns in the original ten mapped fields that are part of the sync configuration. This type of challenge is typical when tools assume your data is already unified, when in fact it rarely is.
There are also challenges with accuracy when accounting for data changes. One common approach is to create new attributes using coding/SQL, as is usually the case with packaged CDPs, but the lack of universal ID across underlying data adds complexity to building attributes and can lead to inaccurate attribute values. Some products calculate attributes and generate insights in a data warehouse or off-platform through code, but if the CDP lacks historical data, calculated attributes will be off.
Finally, you need to account for multiple views of the data. Packaged CDPs typically offer every user the same view of the data, though their needs (and permissions) may be different. This gets even more complex when it’s multiple views across brands and geographies. 

Change management is complex and risky
Updating data workflows takes forever because IT teams must work across multiple SaaS tools that lack any environment (let alone a unified one) for testing and monitoring. Most solutions force you to make changes in production, which puts downstream workflows at risk and makes rolling back changes extremely hard.  
These challenges persist no matter what your approach to customer data is. Whatever your overall data strategy approach, you have a tech stack, and making all the pieces work together is no small feat.
Change management risks breaking or disrupting all downstream systems that rely on the customer data feeds. This is an obvious enough pitfall in the many tools that force you to make changes live in production. Another common approach is to create a copy production environment for testing, then map workflows to the copy, but that presents difficulty in rolling back changes if workflows fail. Finally, some opt to test changes in a non-production environment that only has access to some dummy sample data. This leaves you with a big unknown of whether workflows will work at scale when the sandbox is promoted to production.
Monitoring is often resource-intensive. There are typically two approaches: purchase additional software to monitor the end-to-end data workflow, or hire a team to monitor end-to-end data workflows across all of the disparate elements of a composable CDP.
Maintenance is complicated across multiple tools and environments. You need proficiency in every tool involved and have to go through each individual product’s support when issues arise. In a composable CDP, this could be up to five different platforms. Many opt to build and maintain an entirely separate development environment, which can be cumbersome.
Quality assurance is often manual and time-consuming. Standard approaches have no ability to mass pass/unpause when platform errors occur, and there’s no built-in alert system or tools to do quality assurance checks. You’re left to coordinate the workflow between these tools yourself.
Costs can quickly stack up. When a vendor is completely offloading their storage and computation to your data warehouse, incentives are misaligned. It’s to the vendor’s benefit to rapidly add new capabilities rather than optimizing their efficiency, and you get stuck with the bill.

Customizing tooling is difficult
Adding new technologies to your stack often traps data in silos or forces you into a specific way of working that’s difficult to customize for your business.
There are so many useful tools out there, and it would be great to put them all together to gain the benefit of their capabilities — tools for storage, data science & modeling, analytics, reverse ETL, and others. The problem is that these tools tend to be highly opinionated on how they work. That means there’s no common concept of “customer,” data risks getting trapped in more silos, and you can’t customize the underlying data model.
IT needs to make herculean efforts to get all the parts working together (and keep them that way). It’s often not as fast as intended because IT has to learn multiple systems and be able to pivot between them; it’s often not as cheap as expected since costs escalate as you scale. You end up constantly being at the mercy of how well your tech stack is performing. 
What to look for to make customer data operations successful
I’ve laid out a host of problems here that brands commonly face when trying to handle their customer data operations. My goal isn’t to make you lose hope, but rather to help you understand the scope of the challenge.
We founded Amperity with the aim to help brands finally solve the foundational data quality problem that affects every single thing they want to do with customer data. In the process of building a platform to do this, we came to understand that the data quality problem requires so much maintenance and attention that can’t just be hand-waved away. We realized how hard this stuff is, and we devote all our time and energy to it — consumer brands whose main focus is making the best outdoor gear or providing top-notch hotel experiences or helping people achieve their financial goals shouldn’t have to worry about the million technical ways their customer data strategy could fall apart.
That’s why we built Amperity to answer all the pains of customer data operations. AI-powered, comprehensive identity resolution and a unified customer view with transparency, flexibility, control, stability, speed, and scale. Managing access for business users with multi-brand and multi-database views, role-based views, householding, and custom calculated attributes. Change management with 24/7 data monitoring and alerts, fully integrated live sandboxes for safe testing, and automatic data lineage and audit logs. Flexibility in the tech stack with data egress in any format, automatically-shaped data assets, modular functionality for interoperability, flexible data retention rules, and a cloud-agnostic platform.
Amperity makes customer data operations easy; it’s possible to do it in other ways, but you’ll probably find it’s a lot harder. That’s what we’ve heard for years from brands who have tried to do it on their own.
Either way, the key thing to account for is the size and complexity of the job to be done. Getting value from customer data, powering generative AI, making personalization work right — all of this depends on managing an end-to-end workflow pulling together massive amounts of data and multiple tools. And that just doesn’t happen on its own.

A new report from Salesforce suggests that the increasing use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in Canadian workplaces is mostly unsupervised. 

64 percent of global respondents admitted to passing off AI-generated work as their own. 

The report is based on a double-blind online survey of over 14,000 full-time employees across 14 countries, including 1,020 in Canada. It found that over a quarter of these Canadian employees are using generative AI at work and, of those, over half are using it without the formal approval of their employers. 
The wide release of generative AI tools based on large language models, such as ChatGPT, has started an arms race of investment in the sector, which Goldman Sachs forecasts to approach $200 billion USD by 2025. There has also been a race to launch new products and tools, with Google recently unveiling its own AI model in Gemini, making an increase of workplace use seem inevitable, whether sanctioned or not.  
Alongside 56 percent of the surveyed Canadians using unapproved generative AI tools at work, 28 percent said they have even used tools that were explicitly banned by their workplaces. As workers navigate generative AI in the workplace, 64 percent of global respondents admitted to passing off AI-generated work as their own. 
The unchecked use of AI in the workplace comes with a lack of workplace training or policies, with the report asserting that nearly seven in 10 global workers have never completed or received training on how to use generative AI safely and ethically at work.

As a result, just 13 percent of Canadian workers said they have clearly defined policies for using generative AI at work, with 41 percent reporting that they had no policies on using AI at work and 33 percent saying they did not even know if their workplace had policies.
Despite the general lack of clarity around AI use in the workplace, 63 percent of the surveyed Canadian workers said generative AI makes them more productive at work, while 45 percent claimed it makes them more engaged. 
With the Canadian government seeking guidance on generative AI regulation, the report calls for businesses to implement clear guidelines to ensure generative AI technology is enterprise-ready and used responsibly.
“To realize AI’s full potential, it’s critical that we invest in the employees using the technology as much as the technology itself,” Paula Goldman, Salesforce’s chief ethical and humane use officer, said in a statement. “With clear guidelines, employees will be able to understand and address AI’s risks while also harnessing its innovations to supercharge their careers.”

Bulent Cinarkaya



					General Manager of Field Service Management, ServiceNow				




December 18, 2023




 








In the dynamic field service landscape, Bulent Cinarkaya of ServiceNow explores how generative AI is reshaping operations, offering efficiency, and meeting rising customer expectations.
Talent shortages impact nearly every industry and are especially challenging for field service organizations. According to a recent studyOpens a new window , the retiring workforce will impact 70% of service organizations over the next five to ten years. 
At the same time, customer expectations have increased, requiring faster and more reliable service delivery. But field service teams struggle to keep up with demand. That same study found that 50% of organizations don’t have the resources to keep up with service demand. 
Field service organizations are under pressure to improve the efficiency of their shrinking teams, reduce costs, and increase profits, all while keeping customers and employees happy.
Field service organizations must adopt new strategies and solutions to cope with this challenge. Combining digital platforms, “classic” AI, and generative AI is critical to helping field service organizations overcome labor challenges and improve service quality.
Cutting Back on Busywork
AI and digital tools have transformed the field service industry by automating tedious and time-consuming manual tasks. This transformation has accelerated over the past year through the introduction of generative AI.
One of the manual tasks that field service organizations are streamlining with generative AI is customer debriefs that summarize their history and issue details or the process of documenting work order closure notes. It is an essential part of field service operations, as it helps to track performance, identify issues, and provide feedback. However, it can be a burden for technicians, who must manually draft and submit work order closure notes after each visit. This time-consuming process can slow agents down, reduce their productivity, and contribute to job dissatisfaction.
Generative AI can help automate work order closure notes by accurately distilling the work order information, including customer or incident details, previous touchpoints, actions taken by involved parties, and the eventual resolution, to create case summary notes in seconds for the technician to review. 
By using generative AI to automate tasks such as work order closure notes, field service organizations can improve their efficiency and reduce the workload and stress for their agents, who can focus more on helping customers. They can also improve their data quality and availability, as they can collect more complete and consistent information from each visit.

Enabling Proactive Service
Simplifying time-consuming tasks such as compiling work order closure notes is the tip of the iceberg. AI has the potential to help field service teams open new revenue streams and improve customer experiences through better, faster, more proactive service. 
Implementing proactive service models, or anticipating and preventing potential issues before they affect customers or equipment, has been a key objective for field service organizations for years because it can improve customer satisfaction and drive cost savings. However, proactive, predictive service can be challenging to implement. It requires a significant degree of data analysis, forecasting, and planning.
AI can help field service organizations overcome these challenges and enhance their proactive and predictive service capabilities in three main ways:

AI can analyze historical device data and use predictive analytics to identify potential issues before they occur. This can help organizations reduce downtime and improve overall efficiency. For example, consider a scenario where a retailer must manage point-of-sale (POS) systems across multiple locations. Using AI to analyze data from POS systems directly, the retailer can identify the potential for system crashes or connectivity problems and then automatically schedule a technician site visit to avoid future problems.
AI can speed up diagnostics and analysis and help with installation, parts, and troubleshooting. This allows organizations to improve their overall efficiency while also reducing costs. For example, if a technician is assigned to troubleshoot an issue with a piece of equipment, the technician would typically need to manually diagnose it by testing different components until they find the root cause. With AI’s help, the technician can quickly access diagnostic information that identifies the cause of the issue and resolve it quickly while also reducing downtime. 
AI can cluster similar work orders and discover trends based on trusted work order data and customer history, helping organizations optimize scheduling and better allocate resources. This can drive customer satisfaction and loyalty by assisting organizations in providing efficient service and tailoring service offerings. For example, AI can group work orders based on location, priority, skill level, or equipment type, allowing organizations to assign the right technician to the right job at the right time. 

Providing Better Virtual Experiences
Virtual agents allow customers or technicians to self-serve without relying on human intervention. However, predefined scripts, rules, and keywords have historically limited virtual agents. They cannot understand natural language, generate human-like responses, or learn from feedback, often leading to customer and employee frustration. 
Powered by natural-language understanding (NLU), generative AI-powered virtual agents are better equipped to answer common questions, resolve simple issues, and escalate complex cases to human agents as needed. 
Generative AI-powered virtual agents are even more powerful when integrated with a digital platform. They can dynamically assign field service agents based on requests, reducing workloads for back-office teams. They can also provide real-time information and advice through step-by-step instructions, troubleshooting tips, or safety alerts and help schedule appointments, report g incidents, and request parts. 
Optimizing the Workforce
As the workforce continues to change, field service organizations must prioritize training while ensuring technicians, both full-time employees and contract team members, have the right tools, resources, and optimal schedules to do their jobs effectively. 
AI can help field service organizations better optimize and manage their shifting workforce in three main ways:

It can deliver real-time training and repair recommendations with personalized instructions for the device repairs needed on the spot.  AI can recognize a device and its components, identify the issue and its cause, and generate customized instructions for the repair. It can then use augmented reality to overlay images and text on the technician’s field of view, providing them with visual guidance and feedback. This can help technicians learn new skills, solve problems faster, and deliver better customer service.
It can help reskill and upskill technicians, offering them continuous learning opportunities and feedback by dynamically monitoring and evaluating their performance, identifying their strengths and weaknesses, and providing constructive feedback in their daily work. It can also generate personalized learning paths and materials for technicians based on their skill level, learning style, or career goals. This can help technicians improve their knowledge, skills, and confidence.
It can proactively recommend solutions to technicians and agents and suggest and summarize knowledge articles to help teams resolve issues quickly and accurately. Generative AI can quickly understand the context and content of a case, such as the customer or device details, the problem description, or the previous actions taken. This information can generate relevant and concise solutions or suggestions for technicians, such as troubleshooting steps, best practices, or tips. It can also search and summarize knowledge articles from various sources, such as manuals, databases, or forums, to provide additional information or guidance.

Building Trust in AI
To ensure the long-term success of generative AI, field service organizations need to build trust. This comes from a carefully laid foundation prioritizing high-quality data, safety, governance, and security. 
Monitoring and measuring the impact of generative AI is also crucial. Field service organizations must regularly monitor and evaluate their generative AI performance and impact to ensure they meet goals and expectations. This can help identify and address any issues or risks arising from their generative AI usage.
The Future of Field Service
Generative AI has the potential to radically change the world of work, allowing organizations to drive greater speed, productivity, and value. Companies that harness its power quickly and responsibly can expect new levels of efficiency and productivity for their employees and customers. 
It’s the combination of generative AI with other technologies, such as automation, machine learning, and digital platforms, that will help field service organizations solve their biggest problems by breaking down silos, automating manual processes, and helping teams do more with less.

AI and data science are two very popular buzz words in IT, and for good reason. They’re two sets of technologies that often work hand in hand to boost business insights and productivity. But they have their differences in use cases. Data science is a field of study that examines large data sets with various analytics methods -- including machine learning and pattern discovery -- to extract valuable business insights, while AI refers to a computer’s ability to understand, learn from, and make decisions based on data like humans.

Artificial intelligence is one of the fastest-growing disciplines in technology jobs. The World Economic Forum's ""Future of Jobs Report 2023"" identified AI specialist as one of the fastest-growing career opportunities, projecting a 39% employment growth rate over the next five years.







Although careers in developing artificial intelligence software and models were on the increase before the COVID-19 pandemic, the disruptions it caused accelerated AI adoption. The healthcare industry most obviously benefited from AI by implementing it to scale and to improve telemedicine, advance treatment and vaccine research, and predict and track virus spread. But other businesses, such as banks and retail, also delved into AI software to improve services and analyze big data. Information-based businesses, meanwhile, deployed it to enhance remote work and digitize processes. The generative AI explosion, beginning in 2022, intensified industries' adoption of AI as large language models like ChatGPT and other generative AI platforms have become mainstream.
That means a range of new career possibilities for professionals skilled in AI, machine learning and related applications, such as expert systems, natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition, data analysis and machine vision. Educational institutions are developing more AI courses and programs to prepare the future workforce in these areas. Some offer bachelor's, master's and doctorate degrees in AI, while others focus more on computer science disciplines with a specialty or research program in AI.
Explore the undergraduate and graduate options below, listed alphabetically, for some prestigious programs available to kick off a career in AI.

An AI hallucination is an instance in which an AI model produces a wholly unexpected output; it may be negative and offensive, wildly inaccurate, humorous, or simply creative and unusual.
AI hallucinations are not inherently harmful — in fact, in certain creative and artistic contexts, they can be incredibly interesting — but they are statements that aren’t grounded in fact or logic and should be treated as such.
Some AI hallucinations are easy to spot, while others may be more subtle and go undetected. If users fail to identify an AI hallucination when it occurs and so pass off this output as fact, it can lead to a range of issues. In any case, if your work relies on an generative AI program, it’s essential to prevent AI hallucinations – see our 7 methods below.

Toggle  Understanding AI Hallucinations7 Methods for Detecting and Preventing AI HallucinationsHow and Why Do AI Hallucinations Occur?Issues That May Arise From AI HallucinationsBottom Line: Preventing AI Hallucinations When Using Large-Scale AI Models
Understanding AI Hallucinations
AI models — especially generative AI and Large Language Models (LLM) — have grown in the complexity of the data and queries they can handle, generating intelligent responses, imagery, audio, and other outputs that typically align with the users’ requests and expectations.
However, artificial intelligence (AI) models aren’t foolproof; because of the massive amounts of training data, complicated algorithms, and other less-than-transparent factors that go into preparing these models for the market, many AI platforms have run into issues where they “hallucinate” and deliver incorrect information.
For instance, in this example, ChatGPT AI chatbot attempts to translate “Lojban” – which is a fake language – into English, with semi-hilarious results:

However, an AI hallucination is not always a negative thing, as long as you know what you’re dealing with; certain AI hallucinations, especially with audio and visuals, can lead to interesting elements for creative brainstorming and project development.
7 Methods for Detecting and Preventing AI Hallucinations
The following techniques are designed for AI model developers and vendors as well as for organizations that are deploying AI as part of their business operations, but not necessarily developing their own models.
Please note: These techniques are not focused on the actual inputs users may be putting into the consumer-facing sides of these models. But if you’re a consumer looking to optimize AI outcomes and avoid hallucinatory responses, here are a few quick tips:

Submit clear and focused prompts that stick to one core topic; you can always follow up with a separate query if you have multiple parts to your question.
Ensure you provide enough contextual information for the AI to provide an accurate and well-rounded response.
Avoid acronyms, slang, and other confusing language in your prompts.
Verify AI outputs with your own research.
Pay attention; in many cases, AI hallucinations give themselves away with odd or outlandish language or images.

Now, here’s a closer look at how tech leaders and organizations can prevent, detect, and mitigate AI hallucinations in the AI models they develop and manage:
1) Clean and Prepare Training Data for Better Outcomes
Appropriately cleansing and preparing your training data for AI model development and fine-tuning is one of the best steps you can take toward avoiding AI hallucinations.
A thorough data preparation process improves the quality of the data you’re using and gives you the time and testing space to recognize and eliminate issues in the dataset, including certain biases that could feed into hallucinations.
Data preprocessing, normalization, anomaly detection, and other big data preparation work should be completed from the outset and in some form each time you update training data or retrain your model. For retraining in particular, going through data preparation again ensures that the model has not learned or retained any behavior that will feed back into the training data and lead to deeper problems in the future.
2) Design Models With Interpretability and Explainability
The larger AI models that so many enterprises are moving toward have massive capabilities but can also become so dense with information and training that even their developers struggle to interpret and explain what these models are doing.
Issues with interpretability and explainability become most apparent when models begin to produce hallucinatory or inaccurate information. In this case, model developers aren’t always sure what’s causing the problem or how they can fix it, which can lead to frustration within the company and among end users.
To remove some of this doubt and confusion from the beginning, plan to design AI models with interpretability and explainability, incorporating features that focus on these two priorities into your blueprint design. While building your own models, document your processes, maintain transparency among key stakeholders, and select an architecture format that is easy to interpret and explain, no matter how data and user expectations grow.
One type of architecture that works well for interpretability, explainability, and overall accuracy is an ensemble model; this type of AI/ML approach pulls predicted outcomes from multiple models and aggregates them for more accurate, well-rounded, and transparent outputs.
3) Test Models and Training Data for Performance Issues
Before you deploy an AI model and even after the fact, your team should spend significant time testing both the AI models and any training data or algorithms for performance issues that may arise in real-world scenarios.
Comprehensive testing should cover not only more common queries and input formats but also edge cases and complex queries. Testing your AI on how it responds to a wide range of possible inputs predicts how the model will perform for different use cases. It also gives your team the chance to improve data and model architecture before end users become frustrated with inaccurate or hallucinatory results.
If the AI model you’re working with can accept data in different formats, be sure to test it both with alphanumeric and audio or visual data inputs. Also, consider completing adversarial testing to intentionally try to mislead the model and determine if it falls for the bait. Many of these tests can be automated with the right tools in place.
4) Incorporate Human Quality Assurance Management
Several data quality, AI management, and model monitoring tools can assist your organization in maintaining high-quality AI models that deliver the best possible outputs. However, these tools aren’t always the best for detecting more obscure or subtle AI hallucinations; in these cases and many others, it’s a good idea to include a team of humans who can assist with AI quality assurance management.
Using a human-in-the-loop review format can help to catch oddities that machines may miss and also give your AI developers real-world recommendations for how improvements should be made. The individuals who handle this type of work should have a healthy balance of AI/technology skills and experience, customer service experience, and perhaps even compliance experience. This blended background will give them the knowledge they need to identify issues and create better outcomes for your end users.
5) Collect User Feedback Regularly
Especially once an AI model is already in operation, the users themselves are your best source of information when it comes to AI hallucinations and other performance aberrations. If appropriate feedback channels are put in place, users can inform model developers and AI vendors of real scenarios where the model’s outputs went amiss.
With this specific knowledge, developers can identify both one-off outcomes and trending errors, and, from there, they can use this knowledge to improve the model’s training data and responses to similar queries in future iterations of the platform.
6) Partner With Ethical and Transparent Vendors
Whether you’re an AI developer or an enterprise that uses AI technology, it’s important to partner with other ethical AI vendors that emphasize transparent and compliant data collection, model training, model design, and model deployment practices.
This will ensure you know how the models you use are trained and what safeguards are in place to protect user data and prevent hallucinatory outcomes. Ideally, you’ll want to work with vendors that can clearly articulate the work they’re doing to achieve ethical outcomes and produce products that balance accuracy with scalability.

7) Monitor and Update Your Models Over Time
AI models work best when they are continuously updated and improved. These improvements should be made based on user feedback, your team’s research, trends in the greater industry, and any performance data your quality management and monitoring tools collect. Regularly monitoring AI model performance from all these angles and committing to improving models based on these analytics can help you avoid previous hallucination scenarios and other performance problems in the future.

How and Why Do AI Hallucinations Occur?
It’s not always clear how and why AI hallucinations occur, which is part of why they have become such a problem. Users aren’t always able to identify hallucinations when they happen and AI developers often can’t determine what anomaly, training issue, or other factor may have led to such an outcome.
The algorithms on which modern neural networks and larger AI models are trained are highly complex and designed to mimic the human brain. This gives them the ability to handle more complex and multifaceted user requests, but it also gives them a level of independence and seeming autonomy that makes it more difficult to understand how they arrive at certain decisions.
While it does not appear that AI hallucinations can be eliminated at this time, especially in more intricate AI models, these are a few of the most common issues that contribute to AI hallucinations:

Incomplete training data.
Biased training data.
Overfitting and lack of context.
Unclear or inappropriately sized model parameters.
Unclear prompts.

Issues That May Arise From AI Hallucinations
AI hallucinations can lead to a number of different problems for your organization, its data, and its customers. These are just a handful of the issues that may arise based on hallucinatory outputs:

Inaccurate decision-making and diagnostics: AI instances may confidently make an inaccurate statement of fact that leads healthcare workers, insurance providers, and other professionals to make inaccurate decisions or diagnoses that negatively impact other people and/or their reputations. For example, based on a query it receives about a patient’s blood glucose levels, an AI model may diagnose a patient with diabetes when their blood work does not indicate this health problem exists.
Discriminatory, offensive, harmful, or otherwise outlandish outputs: Whether it’s the result of biased training data or the rationale is completely obscure, an AI model may suddenly begin to generate harmfully stereotypical, rude, or even threatening outputs. While these kinds of outlandish outputs are typically easy to detect, they can lead to a range of issues, including offending the end user.
Unreliable data for analytics and other business decisions: AI models aren’t always perfect with numbers, but instead of stating when they are unable to come to the correct answer, some AI models have hallucinated and produced inaccurate data results. If business users are not careful, they may unknowingly rely on this inaccurate business analytics data when making important decisions.
Ethical and legal concerns: AI hallucinations may expose private data or other sensitive information that can lead to cybersecurity and legal issues. Additionally, offensive or discriminatory statements may lead to ethical dilemmas for the organization that hosts this AI platform.
Misinformation related to global news and current events: When users work with AI platforms to fact-check, especially for real-time news and ongoing current events, depending on how the question is phrased and how recent and comprehensive the AI model’s training is, the model may confidently produce misinformation that the user may spread without realizing its inaccuracies.
Poor user experience: If an AI model regularly produces offensive, incomplete, inaccurate, or otherwise confusing content, users will likely become frustrated and choose to stop using the model and/or switch to a competitor. This can alienate your core audience and limit opportunities for building a larger audience of users.

Bottom Line: Preventing AI Hallucinations When Using Large-Scale AI Models
The biggest AI innovators recognize that AI hallucinations create real problems and are taking major steps to counteract hallucinations and misinformation, but AI models continue to produce hallucinatory content on occasion.
Whether you’re an AI developer or an enterprise user, it’s important to recognize that these hallucinations are happening, but, fortunately, there are steps you can take to better identify hallucinations and correct for the negative outcomes that accompany them. It requires the right combination of comprehensive training and testing, monitoring and quality management tools, well-trained internal teams, and a process that emphasizes continual feedback loops and improvement. With this strategy in place, your team can better address and mitigate AI hallucinations before they lead to cybersecurity, compliance, and reputation issues for the organization.

As organizations continue to navigate the future of work, global HR research and advisory firm McLean & Company suggests that preparing workforces for disruption from generative artificial intelligence (AI) will require evolving strategic HR initiatives to better address the talent gap driven by emerging technologies.TORONTO, Dec. 20, 2023 /PRNewswire/ - Generative artificial intelligence (AI) continues to influence the way work gets done by assisting with and substituting tasks. However, alongside the ample benefits come complications, such as disrupting existing roles, shifting skill requirements, and affecting workforce composition, according to the latest research from McLean & Company, a global HR research and advisory firm. The newly published industry resource, Address the Talent Gap Driven by Generative AI, provides insights that will help HR leaders understand the workforce planning implications of generative AI and adjust initiatives to fill the talent gap.

According to McLean & Company’s new research, workforce planning will help prepare for the impact of generative AI on the workforce; however, even without a formal workforce planning process, discussions around talent demand, supply, and gaps will help navigate generative AI disruption. (CNW Group/McLean & Company)







""Generative AI has the potential to disrupt organizations by automating tasks, reshaping roles, and shifting talent requirements,"" says Lisa Highfield, principal director of Human Resources Technology & Artificial Intelligence at McLean & Company. ""The success of organizations in leveraging generative AI to drive organizational objectives hinges on HR to address the underlying impacts on talent.""

Organizations that adopt generative AI are more likely to gain a competitive advantage through increased productivity and performance, the firm's resource explains. To successfully leverage new technologies, McLean & Company highlights in the blueprint that organizations must first determine how generative AI use supports the organization's strategic objectives to discover its impact on the workforce, and in turn, the talent demand, supply, and gap.
""HR can address the talent gap driven by generative AI by adjusting and developing strategic HR initiatives to build, buy, borrow, redeploy, or reduce talent,"" explains Highfield.To support HR leaders in the future of work, which continues to be heavily impacted by generative AI developments, McLean & Company offers research insights on how to navigate the impact of AI on talent, split into two key sections in the blueprint. An overview of the research is outlined below:1.  Section One: Understand workforce planning implications. The first section discusses the anticipated influence of generative AI on roles, tasks, skills, and workforce demographics. For example, roles requiring a higher degree of decision-making and problem solving, organizational knowledge, creativity and innovation, and social and emotional intelligence are less likely to be automated.The guidance and insights in section one can also help HR leaders understand the impact of generative AI on roles, how it will change the demand for technical and non-technical skills, and how generative AI may contribute to the digital divide and disproportionately affect certain populations.2.  Section Two: Address talent gaps. The second section identifies actions HR can take to reduce talent gaps driven by generative AI and ensure the organization has the right talent in place to meet objectives. Examples of these actions include understanding when to build, buy, borrow, redeploy, or reduce talent in order to respond to organizational needs appropriately, and determining the next steps needed to address talent gaps. Additionally, section two will support HR leaders in planning to address generative AI's impact on workforce planning initiatives and adjusting HR initiatives to plan for the talent gap driven by the new technologies.McLean & Company suggests that while workforce planning will help prepare for the impact of generative AI on the workforce, discussions around talent demand, supply, and gaps will help navigate generative AI disruption even without a formal workforce planning process.To access the full research and insights, please visit Address the Talent Gap Driven by Generative AI.In addition to industry resources, McLean & Company also offers workshops to HR professionals to support them in program building and navigating other nuances of their roles.

The Shortcomings of Generative AI Detection: How Schools Should Approach Declining Teacher Trust In Students

December 18, 2023

[ PDF version ]
Generative AI – systems that use machine learning to produce new content (e.g., text or images) in response to user prompts – has infiltrated the education system and fundamentally shifted the relationships between teachers and their students.
Across the country, educators have expressed high levels of anxiety about students using generative AI tools, like ChatGPT, to cheat on assignments, exams, and essays in addition to fears of students losing critical thinking skills. One professor even described it as having “infected [the education system] like a deathwatch beetle, hollowing out sound structures from the inside until the imminent collapse.” In response to these fears, school districts, like New York City and Los Angeles, quickly imposed bans on its use by both educators and students. Schools have turned to tools like generative AI detectors to attempt to restore educator control and trust; however, detection efforts have fallen short in both their implementation and efficacy.
CDT Research Affirms Declining Trust…
One significant finding from our polling research of teachers, parents, and students is that teacher perception of widespread generative AI use for cheating appears to be largely unfounded. Forty percent of teachers who say that their students have used generative AI for school think their students have used it to write and submit a paper. But only 19 percent of students who report having used generative AI say they have used it to write and submit a paper – a finding that is supported by other survey research. 
Even despite the reality that a large majority of students are not using generative AI for nefarious academic purposes, teachers have still become more mistrustful of students’ work – perhaps due to the widespread, fear-stoking coverage of cheating instances. Sixty two percent of teachers agreed with the statement that “[g]enerative AI has made me more distrustful of whether my students’ work is actually theirs.” And this mistrust is bleeding into certain groups of students being disciplined at disproportionate rates for using or being accused of using generative AI – Title I and licensed special education teachers report higher rates of disciplinary actions for generative AI use among their students.
These high levels of mistrust among teachers and subsequent disciplinary action have led to frustration among students and parents about erroneous accusations of cheating, which can cause an even further rift between teachers and students. This erosion of trust is potentially damaging to school communities where strong relationships between educators and their students are imperative in providing a safe, quality learning environment.
…And Insufficient Detection Tools And Training
Tools designed to detect when generative AI was used to produce content are the only technological solutions currently available to help teachers attempt to combat generative AI-based cheating; however, they fall short of solving existing trust issues. To begin, school policies on content detection tool use is spotty – only 17 percent of teachers say that their school provides a content detection tool as part of its larger technology platform, and 26 percent say their school recommends their use, but leaves it up to the educator to choose one and implement it. Without strong guidance on the use and implementation of content detection tools, teachers appear uneasy about utilizing them as a defense mechanism for cheating. Only 38 percent of teachers report using a generative AI content detection tool regularly, and just 18 percent of teachers strongly agree that these tools “are an accurate and effective way to determine whether a student is using AI-generated content.” Teachers’ lack of confidence is well-founded as, at least at this point, these tools are not consistently effective at differentiating between AI-generated and human-written text.
Beyond using tools for detection, teacher confidence in their own effectiveness at detecting generative AI created writing is low – 22 percent say they are very effective and 43 percent say they are somewhat effective. This is particularly concerning given that most teachers have not received guidance on how to detect cheating. Only 23 percent of teachers who have received training on their schools’ policies and procedures regarding generative AI have gotten guidance on how to detect student use of ChatGPT (or another generative AI tool) when submitting school assignments.
How Should Schools Approach Declining Teacher Trust?
Given our research and what we know about generative AI content detection tools, they are not the answer, at least for now. These tools suffer from accuracy issues, and may disproportionately flag non-native speakers. Instead, schools need to:

Offer teacher training on how to assess student work in light of generative AI: To help teachers feel like they have more control over academic integrity in the classroom, schools must properly equip them to deal with the new reality of generative AI. This means providing them with training on the limitations of detectors and how to respond if they reasonably suspect that a student is cheating.
Craft and implement clear policies about which uses are allowed and prohibited: Our polling from this past summer shows that schools are failing to provide guidance on what is defined as “improper use” of generative AI, with 37 percent of teachers reporting that their school has no policy or they are not sure if there is a policy in place on generative AI. It is imperative for both teachers and students to know this, so that everyone is on the same page about responsible generative AI use. 
Encourage teachers to modify assignments to minimize the effectiveness of generative AI: Understanding what generative AI systems are not good at can help teachers design assignments where using generative AI will not be helpful to students. For instance, generative AI systems are often ineffective at providing accurate sources for their claims. Requiring students to provide citations for any claims they make will likely require students to go far beyond a generated response.

At present, it isn’t easy to find a topic more relevant and rapidly developing than the philosophy of artificial intelligence. Philosophers have been around much longer than computers, and are trying to solve some of the questions about AI which have arisen lately. How does the mind work? Is it possible for machines to act intelligently like humans, and if so, do they have real, “conscious” minds? What are the ethical implications of intelligent machines? And finally, is it possible to create true artificial intelligence?





 
What is Artificial Intelligence?

From Descartes to Turing, the evolution of modern philosophy’s perception of artificial intelligence has been highlighted by conflicting opinions and outlooks.





 
If your phone beats you at chess, it might make you think that artificial intelligence is preparing to take over the world. However, what is artificial intelligence really, and what types of AI exist? What are the latest developments in this area? Should we fear or hope for a future with AI?
 
Artificial intelligence is the ability of digital computers and robots controlled by them to perform tasks that were previously the prerogative of humans.

Modern projects for the development of artificial intelligence systems replicate intellectual processes characteristic of human thinking, such as reasoning, generalization, experience, and data analysis.





 
Artificial intelligence in the contemporary world is a huge range of algorithms and mechanized learning tools that allow you to get data, identify patterns, and optimize processes quickly.
 
The term “artificial intelligence” was coined in 1956 by John McCarthy at the first-ever AI conference at Dartmouth College. AI systems work by using large amounts of data that are analyzed for patterns and correlations and then used to predict events.
 
AI programming focuses on three core skills: learning, reasoning, and self-correction. AI systems can be used to create chatbots that generate text, as well as image and voice recognition, machine vision, natural language processing, robotics, and self-driving cars.
 
How Did Artificial Intelligence Originate?

The basic idea of artificial intelligence (AI) has been around since ancient times, but it wasn’t until the 1950s that it got its name. AIs are intelligent machines that can act and think like humans, or even better than humans. In the decades since, AI has become increasingly powerful as various methods have been developed to improve its effectiveness.





 
In the 1950s, a group of scientists at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire decided to explore the possibilities of AI. They developed the LISP programming language, which allowed for more flexibility in machine learning, i.e., created the ability of computers to learn from “experience” and data.
 
This was a critical step towards building machines with something resembling true intelligence. They were able to make their machines “learn” by rewarding them when they got the right answers and punishing them when they got the wrong answer.





 
Significant progress was made over the next decade, and in 1961 the British scientist Joseph Weizenbaum wrote Eliza, the first conversational computer program. Then, subsequent programs laid the foundations of modern technology.
 
These included game programs, such as a checkers-playing machine, which could play at the level of a grandmaster. Additionally, scientists created systems based on vision, natural language processing, and robotic systems designed to mimic human behavior in a physical environment (for example, in factories).

In the 1970s, more significant advances were made. Expert systems have been developed that can make decisions in complex areas such as medical diagnostics or legal disputes.





 
In addition, neural networks emerged. These simulated parts of the brain in software form and were used to create advanced algorithms designed specifically for robotic applications such as self-driving cars or uncrewed aerial vehicles (drones).
 
The 1980s and 1990s and beyond saw a boom in technology that led to a plethora of new AI applications, from virtual agents able to communicate with customers over the phone or online chats and automated stock trading to products such as Apple’s Siri, which understands users requests in natural language using voice commands.
 
Today, artificial intelligence is being used more and more in many areas—from healthcare, where it makes diagnoses based on thousands of images and medical records, to finance, where banks use predictive analytics and even help traders/investors make better decisions faster than ever before.





 
However, what does philosophy have to the development of artificial intelligence?
 
René Descartes’ Philosophical Justifications for the Existence of Artificial Intelligence
René Descartes, created by the author using an Artificial Intelligence (Midjourney)
 
René Descartes, one of the most influential philosophers in the modern era, has been credited with groundbreaking contributions to philosophical thought, including his views on artificial intelligence. In his famous work, Meditations on First Philosophy, Descartes laid down a foundation for the possibility of having machines that act as if they had minds and consciousness like humans.





 
Descartes began by positing that human beings are composed of two distinct substances—the physical body and the immaterial mind (or soul). He argued that while physical bodies can be examined objectively, thoughts and mental states can only be known through introspection. This idea is often summarized as “cogito ergo sum” or “I think therefore I am.”
 
He further argued that since thinking is essential to an individual’s existence, it must necessarily be possible for a being to think without possessing a physical body. This led him to believe in the possibility of creating a thinking machine that could operate much like a human being.
 
For Descartes, the key factor in determining whether something was capable of thinking was language processing. He believed that if we could create a machine capable of understanding and using language fluently, then it would demonstrate evidence of true intelligence.





 
In other words, he saw language processing as an essential marker for consciousness, reasoning that there must be some kind of inner capacity within such a machine that holds concepts and thoughts through languages like us humans. Descartes’ contributions and justifications set up an important conceptual foundation for artificial intelligence.
 
Can Machines Think?

“Can machines think?”—this important question was raised in 1950 by the British mathematician and logician Alan Turing. He emphasizes that the traditional approach to this issue is first to define the concepts of “machine” and “intelligence.”





 
Turing, however, took a different path; instead, he replaced the original question (which he found to be nearly impossible to answer) with another “which is closely related to the original and is relatively unambiguous.” Essentially, he proposed to replace the question “Can machines think?” with the simpler question “Can machines do what we (as thinking creatures) can do?”
 
A computer can be considered intelligent if it can make us believe that we are not dealing with a machine but with a person. The advantage of the new question, according to Turing, is that it draws a clear line between the physical and intellectual capabilities of a person, for which Turing offers an empirical test.

The essence of an actual, practical Turing test is as follows. A judge, a man, and a machine are all put in different rooms. The judge is in correspondence with both the man and the machine, not knowing in advance which of the interlocutors is a man and which is a machine. The response time to a question is fixed so that the judge cannot determine the machine by this feature (in Turing’s time, machines were slower than humans, but now they react faster and this limit is not important anymore).





 
If the judge cannot determine which of his interlocutors is a machine, then the machine has passed the Turing test and can be considered thinking. Moreover, the machine will not just be a semblance of the human mind—it will simply count as a mind. We will have no way of distinguishing its behavior from human behavior. This interpretation of artificial intelligence as a full-fledged equivalent of natural human intelligence has been called “strong AI.”
 
Let’s pay attention to the fact that the Turing test does not mean at all that the machine should “understand” the essence of the words and expressions with which it operates. The machine only needs to successfully imitate meaningful responses to be considered truly intelligent.





 
A Criticism of the Turing Test: Searle’s Chinese Room Experiment

In 1980, John Rogers Searle, an American philosopher, proposed a thought experiment that criticized the Turing test and the notion that an intelligent mind can exist without understanding.





 
The essence of the Chinese room experiment is as follows. A scientist places a men in a room in which baskets full of Chinese characters are placed.
 
The man is given a textbook, in English, which provides rules for combining Chinese characters. The man can easily apply these rules, even though he does not speak Chinese; he can rely on the shape of the symbols described in the textbook without understanding the meaning of the symbols.
 
Searle imagines that people outside the room who understand Chinese are transmitting character sets into the room and that, in response, the man inside opens the textbook, manipulates the characters according to the rules, and feeds back a set of characters through the door.
 
Thus, the man in the room passes a kind of Turing test for knowledge of the Chinese language, which he actually does not know. Searle shows that the Turing test is not a criterion for the presence of consciousness at all, but only a criterion for the ability to successfully manipulating symbols.
 
The essence of Searle’s position on the issue of artificial intelligence is as follows: the mind operates with semantic content (semantics) or meaning, while a computer program is completely determined by its syntactic structure (the form of the symbols it operates with). Therefore, passing the Turing test does not imply the presence of a mind.
 
What is the Modern Take on the Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence?





Philosophy of artificial intelligence, created by the author using an Artificial Intelligence (Midjourney)
 
The modern philosophical perception of artificial intelligence has evolved significantly since Descartes and Turing. Today, many philosophers recognize that machines can simulate aspects of human cognition and decision-making, but they are less convinced that machines are truly conscious or possess a mind in the same sense as humans.





 
One important aspect of contemporary philosophy concerned with AI is its reliance on cognitive science. Cognitive scientists view the mind as a computational system and have therefore sought to understand how algorithms and programs could mimic the functioning of a human mind.
 
However, they tend to be cautious about the extent to which artificial systems can really “understand” meaning or truly “reason” about information in the way humans do.
 
There is also an area within philosophy called philosophy of mind that deals with questions about consciousness and whether it arises from computational processes. Some philosophers argue that consciousness emerges from complex computations, whereas others claim consciousness cannot be mechanized at all.
 
Another approach towards AI in philosophy comes from ethics. Philosophers are keen to explore what ethical issues arise when developing AI technologies, such as where responsibility for machine actions is located (who bears the blame for errors) or the responsibility for a machine’s behavior as compared with human behavior.
 
While skepticism remains to some extent around true intelligence being possible through computational mechanics alone, most philosophers do acknowledge that AI systems can achieve remarkable feats, particularly when experts build them with complex decision-making components resembling human reasoning processes.

Generative AI: Catalyst for job growth or automation threat?

        Tech Mahindra’s CEO CP Gurnani sees generative AI creating more jobs, challenging fears of workforce disruptions, and advocating adaptability.

While anxieties surrounding generative AI’s potential to disrupt the workforce, Tech Mahindra’s outgoing CEO, CP Gurnani, contended that generative AI has the capacity to generate more employment opportunities than it is anticipated to eliminate. Despite widespread concerns on social media regarding AI’s impact on the job market, Gurnani emphasised that the full spectrum of generative AI use cases is still evolving, suggesting a wealth of untapped potential for job creation.
“The use cases of generative AI are still being defined, which means that it has the potential to create more job opportunities in the future,” Gurnani said. He highlighted the capabilities of AI models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard, citing their ability to generate human-quality writing, poetry, and even complex code.
Unlike some industry leaders who predict significant job losses due to automation, Gurnani, one of the longest-serving CEOs in the US$245 billion Indian IT sector, believed skilled professionals will remain irreplaceable. “New jobs will also get created. The market will expand,” he added.
This optimistic outlook aligns with other prominent voices like NR Narayana Murthy, Co-Founder of Infosys, who dismissed fears of coders being replaced by generative AI tools. The evidence so far also supports Gurnani’s stance. A recent study by the European Central Bank and International Labour Organization found no significant job losses directly attributable to generative AI automation, reported The Business Times.

Recognising the need for workforce adaptation, Gurnani urged young engineers to embrace lifelong learning and independent skill development. He suggested a departure from the conventional approach of organisations like Infosys, known for its expansive training centre in Mysuru, Karnataka. This shift may signify a broader transformation in the operational model of Indian IT organisations, moving away from campus recruitment and centralised training towards a more agile and skill-oriented approach.

There have been claims that artificial intelligence is bringing about increased productivity, accuracy, and a smarter workplace. In all of this excitement, it is difficult to differentiate between fact and fantasy. When it comes to the management of workforces, what is the truth there? Within the context of real-world applications, how much hype is there?
This post will discuss the use of artificial intelligence for workforce management. AI’s influence on the workforce, its advantages for managers and teams, and the ways in which AI can be incorporated into workforce management are all topics that will be discussed. What is the truth about artificial intelligence in the management of workforces?
Understanding Artificial Intelligence Workforce Management
What does artificial intelligence mean for the management of workforces? AI is utilized to improve the management of your workforce. It involves using artificial intelligence tools to analyze data, predict trends, and automate tasks. Some of the tasks that are involved include employee engagement, payroll, and scheduling. In terms of workforce management, it is comparable to having a smart assistant, which frees up your time to focus on the human side of things.
AI is already present in workforce management, and it is causing a shift in the way we work. The automation of tasks such as scheduling and payroll grants managers the opportunity to devote their attention to the engagement and development of their staff members. 
Instead of simply automating tasks, artificial intelligence for workforce management uses technology to make decisions that are more intelligent. In order to gain a deeper comprehension of their workforce, managers can use artificial intelligence to analyze data and patterns. The process of making decisions regarding scheduling, staffing, and other matters is facilitated by this. Being proactive is something that managers can do by predicting future trends.
The role that artificial intelligence plays in decision-making
Managing a workforce can feel like a never-ending juggling act. Create calendars, assign projects, ensure that performance is being monitored, and take into consideration the long-term needs of the team. It’s overwhelming, and we all need some assistance.
AI for workforce management. It is comparable to having a trustworthy friend. When you focus on the bigger picture, AI will handle the specifics. How does one go about doing it?
Making sense of the data
AI functions as a detective who analyzes data. It analyzes data quickly to find trends and patterns that humans may take a long time to discover. AI provides insights for informed decision-making, such as identifying peak productivity times and flagging workflow issues.
Forecasting made easy
AI can also be used as a fortune teller. It forecasts the requirements for the workforce in the future. AI helps you stay ahead in planning projects and anticipating fluctuations.
Individualized solutions for each employee
There is no universally applicable AI. It acknowledges the individuality of each worker and offers a personalized approach to the working environment. Using preferences, skills, and availability as criteria, artificial intelligence assists with decision-making. To each member of the team, it is similar to having a personalized playbook.
Avoid decision fatigue
It can be exhausting to make decisions. For the purpose of preventing decision fatigue and allowing you to concentrate on important calls that require your unique human touch, artificial intelligence handles routine tasks.
As a manager, artificial intelligence will not be able to take your place. It improves team decision-making. AI can help you be a dependable leader for your team. 
AI efficiency and automation
Managing a team’s schedules, tasks, and performance can be a full-time job. For you to be able to manage everything without adding to your list of things to do, you need tools. It is essential to have AI.
AI-powered workforce management tools automate and streamline repetitive tasks. In this article, we will discuss some of the ways that artificial intelligence can make your life easier:
Auto scheduling
No more manual employee scheduling. Scheduling is created by AI tools based on the availability of employees, their preferences, and the requirements of the business. Save time and maintain fair schedules for a happy team.
Track time
AI automates time tracking, reducing errors and ensuring accuracy. You are able to focus on more important tasks and increase your productivity thanks to artificial intelligence’s ability to keep track of your work hours.
Attendance
Attendance issues can be a hassle. Attendance is monitored by AI tools, reminders are sent out, and patterns are flagged for addressing. Remain informed without engaging in micromanagement.
Task allocation
Assigning tasks is challenging. Tools that use artificial intelligence analyze the capabilities, availability, and workload of employees in order to automatically assign tasks to them. Ensures that work is distributed effectively and prevents burnout from occurring.
Monitoring performance
Tracking performance is time-consuming. AI systems collect and analyze performance data, delivering reports and highlighting areas needing attention.
Adapting to change
AI tools are useful for adapting to workforce changes, like absences or new hires. They can quickly adjust schedules and tasks, saving time and maintaining continuity.
Efficiency and automation are the focus of artificial intelligence workforce management tools. They handle small tasks so you can focus on leading, connecting, and achieving goals.
Increasing the level of employee engagement with use of AI
Employee engagement is important but can be difficult for managers. We are looking for a group of people who are enthusiastic, committed, and invested in the work that they do. In the midst of juggling other responsibilities, what are some ways to encourage engagement?
AI tools for managing the workforce. There are new ways in which tools can increase employee engagement. AI can help create engaged and motivated teams.

Artificial intelligence can analyze surveys that are filled out by employees, which can then provide insights regarding the employees’ needs, concerns, and suggestions. It demonstrates to employees that their opinions are valued and that you are committed to maintaining a positive work environment if you listen to their feedback and then take action.
Using AI in workforce management demonstrates support and value for your team. Engaged employees = successful business.
The advantages of using predictive analytics in the workforce management
Predictive analytics is something we should discuss. It is comparable to a crystal ball for predicting trends in the workforce and making more informed choices. How cool is that? In the realm of workforce management, predictive analytics can be of assistance.
Staffing needs anticipation
Predictive analytics helps identify demand patterns for staffing. Be prepared and ready to handle everything without last-minute scrambles for extra help.
Reducing turnover
Predictive analytics can be used to analyze employee data in order to identify factors that contribute to employee turnover, such as levels of engagement, job satisfaction, or workload. Deal with potential problems as soon as they arise in order to keep valuable team members.
Scheduling optimization
The use of predictive analytics allows for the creation of schedules that take into account employees’ availability, the requirements of the business, and weather patterns. The final result? Everyone is content when their schedules are well-balanced and efficient.
Training opportunities identification
Predictive analytics can identify training needs for employees. It is beneficial to both job satisfaction and performance to invest in the growth of a team.

Addressing concerns around AI in workforce management
AI is great, right? It can be scary, though. People can have doubts or worries about using AI to manage employees. Taking care of common problems.
Will AI replace jobs?
No. AI helps, not takes over. It is meant to help you do your job better. It’s like having a helpful friend who can do simple things for you while you focus on the bigger picture.
Is AI too complex?
Let us bust this myth. AI tools for managing employees are easy to use and make sense. Anyone can benefit, you don’t have to be tech-savvy. There are a lot of tools and people who can help you get started.
Can AI be trusted with sensitive data?
Trusting AI with employee data is crucial. Most AI tools safeguard your data. Choose a reliable provider and protect your data.
Will AI impact morale?
Concerns about team reactions to AI tools are normal. Communication is key. AI supports, not monitors or replaces your team. Involve them and highlight benefits to create a positive environment.
Is AI worth the investment?
AI in workforce management is costly but has lasting results. Automate processes, streamline scheduling, and enhance employee engagement to save time, cut costs, and increase productivity.
The use of AI can make working in a team more enjoyable and make your job easier. Make sure that you don’t let your worries prevent you from investigating the advantages of workforce management.
The ways AI can be used to improve performance
Business leaders are excited about how AI could help their companies with performance management trends. Free employees from redundant tasks and hire people for suitable jobs. Focusing on valuable tasks brings freedom and liberation.
The software that is driven by AI allows them to measure the results. Using AI to manage performance has the potential to revolutionize business processes.
The number of people who are proficient in technology is increasing. Teams are currently in the process of selecting a performance management system in order to automate tasks that are routine in nature. Throughout time and in response to the performance of employees, perspectives and feedback are subject to change.
What role does AI play in performance management, and how does it work?
1. Reviews of performance that are automated
AI-driven performance management is extremely popular among business leaders. During employee reviews, it assists leaders in concentrating on the facts. Worker collaboration and decision-making are required. Using AI software for performance management improves collaboration measurement.
2. Continuous tests in real time
Regular feedback sessions benefit from modern performance management guidelines. The use of rigid performance evaluation cycles may become less necessary as a result of AI. When combined with performance AI, it offers both flexibility and insights.
It speeds up and guarantees prompt feedback. Employee performance is negatively impacted by inconsistent feedback. Timely feedback improves productivity.
3. Learning and Development
Artificial intelligence is able to evaluate areas in which employees could improve. The manager is provided with information regarding the areas in which employees need improvement.
It is possible for AI to assist workers in updating their skills before they become obsolete. AI will not be able to replace jobs, but it will assist workers in remaining relevant and improving their skills. This will prevent individuals from becoming redundant in their roles. Competencies in mathematics and interpersonal communication are always important.
4. Removes bias
AI removes biases in performance evaluations for fair assessment. By taking care of administrative tasks, automated performance evaluations eliminate the need for human resource professionals and managers to spend time and resources. It’s often subconscious, like making mistakes in one-on-one meetings.
Using AI in performance management has the potential to eliminate bias and advance equality. AI promotes equality and fairness by using performance AI, without biases based on age, race, gender, ethnicity, nationality, etc.
Humans get distracted, machines stay focused. AI and machine learning could create a fairer workplace for pay raises and promotions.
5. Straightforward internal communication and resolution of questions
It is essential to maintain smooth communication at work because miscommunication is a common occurrence. AI automates repetitive responses for quick employee access to answers. By relieving business leaders, HR professionals, and executives of the burden of question and answer sessions, it enables them to concentrate on more important tasks.
Sometimes, we can’t share all the available information about the organization. Employees will have an easier time accessing and acting upon information and details if they are centralized and updated in a single location.

6. Performance feedback that is quick, flexible, and ongoing
Performance reviews are out of date and don’t help the business or the employee get better. We need better feedback solutions to help employees improve. The process is fair and unbiased, giving each employee a unique experience. Plus, it encourages peer review of work.
7. Enhance the level of talent management that is conducted.
Finding talent is a tough challenge for HR leaders. The market has talent, but they’re unsure if it fits culturally.
Artificial intelligence-driven performance management is being used by business leaders and recruiters to improve the quality of recruitment. The right talent can be found and the right hiring decision can be made with its assistance.
Implementing performance management systems that make use of artificial intelligence helps to reduce the need for tasks that require a significant amount of time and automate actions that are repetitive. Improvements will be made to performance management, talent acquisition, and onboarding practices through the utilization of artificial intelligence and machine learning software.
8. Strong data analytics to solve problems
When used in performance management, AI helps leaders solve problems and make decisions based on data.
It can help you with more than just solving problems. Leaders have to deal with problems that people can’t solve.
Within the context of the workplace, technology is a game-changer. AI and other forms of automated technology are being utilized by businesses in order to solve problems.
AI automates manual reviews and evaluations, solving a significant challenge. AI ensures end-to-end visibility, eliminating disparities. Crucial for problem-solving.
9. Access to information that is both simple and speedy
30% of employees want a “Google-like” option for work help and information, according to a recent ServiceNow survey. Voice tech is popular in homes.
Alexa, Google Home, and Siri’s popularity is enough evidence without data. For the purpose of conducting performance evaluations of employees who work TSplus Remote Support, the utilization of voice assistance in the workplace is something that is absolutely necessary.
An effective solution should be mobile, personal, and offer employees engagement and support options.
10. Improved productivity and innovative insights
Improving employee engagement requires first gaining an understanding of the intentions of employees and then developing a workflow that is based on those intentions. NLU and deep learning will aid in entity extraction and sentence analysis for improved employee engagement.
Real-time data is made possible for businesses by HR technology. HR tech tools like Pulse Surveys help managers understand their team’s daily experiences.
It is possible that the fact that they belong to the late majority (34% of the population) is the reason why some human resource professionals are uncertain about whether or not HRIS are designed for performance management. As demand and popularity continue to rise, confidence will increase, and the culture of the workforce will improve.
11. Collaboration, teamwork & progress
Companies succeed with a collaborative workspace, free from hierarchy, bias, and inconsistency.
Technology improves HR processes, but human intervention is still needed for idea building, campaigns, and connecting with customers as caring individuals.
Intelligence and data are valuable assets for a company. AI in performance management system helps leaders save time and focus on their teams and ideas.
These ideas aid in creating a timeline, meeting deadlines, and fostering team growth. This will improve their performance and productivity.
AI will ensure fair appraisals without emotional barriers. Unfair treatment can cause mental friction. It is the goal of artificial intelligence software in performance management to eradicate it.

BOT or NOT? This special series explores the evolving relationship between humans and machines, examining the ways that robots, artificial intelligence and automation are impacting our work and lives.






In the new 2024 Player’s Handbook, all of the core character classes in Dungeons & Dragons will get full-color illustrations like this one, which depicts a fighter. (Nestor Ossandón for Wizards of the Coast)
In response to social media criticism, Wizards of the Coast has released a statement that further clarifies its stance on the use of generative AI in material for the Dungeons & Dragons tabletop game.
The statement, made via a post on the digital storefront D&D Beyond, indicates that all creative contributors to D&D will be required “to refrain from using AI generative tools to create final D&D products.”
This comes four months after an incident in August where an artist admitted he’d used AI tools to “polish” several illustrations that he’d contributed to a new D&D sourcebook. In response, Wizards pledged to amend its artistic guidelines to prohibit creators from using generative AI.
Today’s updated statement appears to come as a response to an online discussion. On Dec. 1, a piece of artwork appeared on the official Dungeons & Dragons X (formerly Twitter) account to tease the upcoming 2024 rules update for D&D, which will include brand-new editions of the game’s 3 core rulebooks.



The artwork in question, by Chilean illustrator Nestor Ossandón, depicts a dwarf warrior. It’s one of many new illustrations that are planned to run in the updated D&D Player’s Handbook, and made its public debut earlier this month at a panel at the Penny Arcade Expo Unplugged in Philadelphia.
In response to the teaser, many fans wondered if it had been created using AI tools, citing issues such as the seeming absence of the dwarf’s left arm. Wizards first responded on Dec. 18 via the official D&D Beyond X account, saying that it had checked with the original artist to ensure that no generative AI had been used.



Wizards further clarified its stance on Tuesday by announcing its blanket prohibition.
“We work with some of the most talented artists and creatives in the world,” according to the blog post, “and we believe those people are what makes D&D great.”
The response comes a week after reports that multiple workers at Renton, Wash.-based Wizards of the Coast had been impacted by a round of layoffs instituted by parent company Hasbro, including several senior employees who worked on both Dungeons & Dragons and Magic: The Gathering.

4 Ways Finance and Accounting Pros Can Adapt Now to Working With Generative AI
AI-powered tools for finance and accounting organizations have been around for years, helping to automate data entry and bookkeeping, invoice processing, budgeting, and many other processes. But generative AI is different.

Accounting and finance professionals are always on the lookout for tools that can help them become more efficient, productive and accurate in their work. And for well over a third (38%) of workers in the profession recently surveyed by Robert Half, generative AI is one technology that they expect will make a positive impact on their careers. That includes creating more demand for their skills.
Of course, to stay in demand, finance and accounting pros will need to ensure that they maintain relevant skills, especially when it comes to working with generative AI. AI-powered tools for finance and accounting organizations have been around for years, helping to automate data entry and bookkeeping, invoice processing, budgeting, and many other processes. But generative AI is different. It is more than just a helper — it has the potential to fundamentally transform finance and accounting roles.
Mark D. McDonald, a senior director at Gartner, said as much in a recent Wall Street Journal article that examined CFOs’ “ambitious plans” for generative AI — and their hopes that the technology can help them to overcome the skilled talent shortage. McDonald predicted, “Ten years from now, finance and accounting professionals will have a totally different set of skills than the experienced professional of today and will largely look more like data scientists and systems engineers.”

There is no time to waste in growing your understanding of AI
You may not have anticipated a need for data science and systems engineering skills when you decided to become an accountant — and depending on your role, it may turn out you don’t need them. However, your work is likely to become more challenging regardless, and in a good way. Another key message in that Wall Street Journal article is that generative AI can give accounting and finance professionals more time to engage in work that they find fulfilling and intellectually stimulating.
Robert Half’s research indicates that many workers in the field are already experiencing this change because of AI. Nearly one-third (30%) of accounting and finance pros we surveyed said that one of the greatest benefits of using generative AI on the job is that it allows them to focus more on strategic thinking and problem-solving. (Increased efficiency and productivity was the top benefit cited.)
That’s certainly a positive development, and a shift in the nature of work that many accounting and finance professionals have been hoping for. If you are eager to seize that opportunity yourself, know that it will require two things: preparation and a willingness to adapt.
In other words, don’t wait for the day when you’re told you need to learn to work with generative AI. It is to your benefit to begin building a productive relationship with this powerful technology today. Here are four ways to do it:
1. Start with the fundamentals
You didn’t become an accountant or CPA overnight. Learning to work effectively with AI will require time and effort, too, and it starts with building up your fundamental knowledge about the technology. You don’t need to become an AI expert, but it is worth your while to grow your understanding of basic AI concepts and related technologies like machine learning and natural language processing.
Consider enrolling in online courses and training programs that specifically focus on the role of AI in finance and accounting. Workshops and webinars conducted by industry experts and companies that specialize in AI can also be highly valuable. Also, engage with professional organizations and networks where finance and accounting professionals discuss AI integration and best practices.
2.  Identify practical use cases for AI
As you increase your understanding of generative AI and gain practical insights into working with it, it will become clearer how to use the technology to enhance your role and responsibilities. You can then start to identify specific use cases where AI can bring value not only to your own work, but potentially, your whole team. Data analysis, forecasting and compiling reports are just some examples you may find.
While you may not be able to fully control the extent to which your organization adopts AI capabilities, your efforts to find practical applications for the technology can help to inform decision-making around what types of tools to implement that can benefit everyone. Your interest and enthusiasm can also help to foster a team environment that encourages collaboration and collective learning around AI.
3. Step up your soft skills
Evolving your technical abilities is a must if you want to make the most of generative AI tools for finance and accounting, but growing your soft skills is also vital. You will need to expand and refine skills like communication, problem-solving, strategic thinking and even empathy so that you can step into the other, nontechnical types of work that AI will eventually free you to focus on.
So, be sure to take advantage of professional and leadership development programs that your firm may offer. If needed, consider investing in relevant learning opportunities outside of the organization as well. Increasing the depth and range of your abilities can help position you for new career opportunities, as well, considering that 95% of hiring managers in finance and accounting face challenges in locating skilled candidates, according to Robert Half’s research.
4. Commit to continuous learning
You may want to ramp up your AI skills fast, and it’s certainly possible. But know that AI-related learning will be an ongoing process. The technology is rapidly evolving, and you will need to make a concerted effort to stay abreast of the latest developments, especially as they relate to finance and accounting.
Subscribing to newsletters, following industry blogs and participating in forums are some simple, everyday approaches to staying informed about AI tools and trends. Also seek to forge relationships with people in your organization or professional network who have deep knowledge of AI and extensive hands-on experience working with technology. Getting to know the data scientists and systems engineers in your orbit isn’t a bad idea either, seeing as your work in the future might echo theirs.
No matter how you might feel about generative AI’s recent and rapid rise in the workplace, it is a wave of change that all accountants must embrace at some level. Consider recent research conducted by Thomson Reuters Institute that found one in 10 professionals in accounting firms and corporate tax departments are already using some form of generative AI on a widescale basis. And 51% reported that they expect their firms to start using the technology within the next six to 12 months.
So, generative AI is likely at the doorstep of your CPA firm, if it isn’t already working with you at your desk. In either case, now is the time to adapt and expand your skills and knowledge so that you will be prepared to thrive in a profession that AI is poised to change significantly — and soon.

As the White House moves forward with the implementation of its executive order on artificial intelligence, a shortage of domestic workers skilled in AI is creating opportunities for experts around the world to seek sponsored employment with the U.S. government.
The long-awaited order arrived with a laundry list of requirements for agencies, which are now tasked with growing the federal talent pool with workers who have experience in AI research, development, procurement and deployment. 
To fill that pool, the Biden administration is “putting a lot of emphasis on bringing in talent from everywhere,” White House Office of Science and Technology Policy Director Arati Prabhakar said in an interview with FedScoop, underlining the importance foreign nationals will play in getting the federal government up to speed on AI.
The executive order’s callouts to boost the AI workforce within federal agencies “is just the next chapter of a long American story of people, American kids going into science and technology and making huge contributions,” Prabhakar said. “Also coupled with being able to attract some amazing talent from around the world and who come here for these tremendous opportunities in our country. [White House officials] very much want to make sure both of those continue to happen.”

At AI.gov, the Biden administration has highlighted both immigrant and nonimmigrant pathways for foreign nationals to bring their knowledge of AI to the federal government. 
And in cases where agencies face challenges in the form of lengthy hiring processes or other roadblocks for meeting workforce requirements laid out in the order, OSTP is providing “levers” to help, Prabhakar said. That includes AI-specific cohorts, created by the Presidential Innovation Fellows and the U.S. Digital Corps, bringing talent from the private sector to the public sector.
Lynne Parker, a former deputy U.S. chief technology officer who assisted with the Trump White House’s 2020 executive order that called on agencies to annually create AI use case inventories, said in an interview with FedScoop that there is a “shortage” of AI talent. There’s also the challenge, Parker added, of the government competing for AI talent with industry,  where individuals are able to solve “interesting problems” for higher pay. 
“If you’re going to be training the talent in our universities here, then obviously it makes a lot of sense for us to try to recruit them to stay here to benefit the United States,” Parker said. “Since there’s such a huge shortfall of talent, I think there’s that emphasis on immigration, [which] is a recognition of the fact that … a high percentage of people who are getting that expert-level training [in AI] are coming from overseas. That’s where I think the most immediate pipeline of available talent is.”
Parker said it’s possible that “many Ph.D. graduates would like to go into academia, but they may feel like it’s too difficult to get the research funding that they need in order to be successful.” But if funding were available to train more students, and funding was easier to attain, then individuals may be more inclined to go into academia to train the next generation, she said.

Prabhakar, meanwhile, noted the various open roles for AI across the government makes clear the “need to learn how to use this powerful technology in really creative ways that are deeply responsible as a great way for government to lead by example in the use of AI.” 
“We were thrilled with the response to the AI talent surge when the executive order came out,” she added. “Just an enormous volume of wonderful resumes that came in —  people who have built all the data systems and the computational capacity that you have to have [in order] to use AI intelligently.”
OSTP is trying to leverage effective tech talent programs deployed over the past decade to bring more tech-centric skills into government, Prabhakar said, with the aim of providing those interested in working on AI with more opportunities in federal agencies. 
The feedback from agencies on the EO’s actions, including workforce requirements, has so far been positive, according to Olivia Zhu, a senior policy adviser with OSTP. In an interview with FedScoop, Zhu said the White House is “super optimistic that we’ve gotten a really large influx of interest from the public.”
“When we were creating this executive order, the president directed the team to pull every lever,” Zhu said. “The feedback is reflecting our intentions of understanding that AI has such broad applications in various areas, right from the workforce to the use in government, to ensuring that we have safety standards.”

Is Africa ready for Artificial Intelligence (AI) in today’s world?

December 18, 2023 0

Advances in technology have modified the way people work. AI is everywhere, and machine thinking is now in our homes, offices, schools and hospitals. Computer algorithms are driving cars, diagnosing patients at hospitals and telling us what to read on our smartphones. The question to confront is: Is Africa ready for artificial intelligence in today’s world?
Yes. More than five decades ago, Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah stirringly called Africa to the promise of technology. Indeed, the clarion call echoed by Ghana’s most loved first president and outstanding African leader, Osagyefo Dr. Nkrumah, to African leaders and the African Union (AU) on the need to embrace science and technology as the lifeblood of our continent is as important today as it was a little over fifty (50) years ago.



Indeed, to a large extent Africa missed the first, second and third industrial revolutions, but I am confident that our continent will not miss the fourth and fifth.
With the rise of artificial intelligence, the future appears promising. However, several analysts have also raised concerns about the potential for job displacement.
Experts predict that AI could replace certain jobs or make them obsolete, leading to job losses and a need for employees to adapt and learn new skills. Therefore, we must strategically invest in the capacity of our human resources to rise to the occasion.
Although Artificial intelligence is the ability of machines to copy human intelligent behaviour, it cannot fully replace human intelligence. Artificial intelligence lacks some human qualities such as empathy, creativity and critical thinking. Human beings by nature possess unique cognitive abilities and emotional intelligence that are essential in many domains, including complex decision-making, social interactions and ethical considerations. Therefore, AI and human intelligence can work together synergistically to achieve a better outcome.
Artificial intelligence and big data technologies have penetrated many markets. Here are just a few examples:
In the education sector, for example, AI-based learning platforms like ChatGBT have gained popularity due to their ability to engage students conversationally. Students now have access to personalised learning; they can ask questions in a local vernacular, and the English tutor will support them. AI can automate grading, giving educators more time for other tasks.
In Agriculture
There is an AI mobile app that can recommend what type of fertiliser to use in crop farming, which is a game-changer for farmers – but many of them will still have to grapple with issues of connectivity and literacy.
Banking and finance
The AI chatbots used by some banks help with basic transactions or provide appropriate solutions to various consumer inquiries, such as account balance information. Bank customers can get 24/7 service from a Chabot or an AI-powered banker, and can expect to receive swift financial counsel based on their money history, risk tolerance and financial goals.
AI in transportation
AI technologies are used in transportation to manage traffic, predict flight delays and make ocean shipping safer and more efficient.
The Current State of AI in Africa
Africa has made significant strides in adopting AI technologies over recent years. Several countries, including South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria, have established AI research centres and innovation hubs. These initiatives aim to foster collaboration, research and development in AI, with a focus on addressing local challenges and driving economic growth.
Furthermore, African governments have recognised the importance of AI and started implementing policies for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education, and strategies to support its integration. For instance, the African Union launched the ‘AI for Development Initiative’ to promote AI-driven solutions for sustainable development across the continent.
Challenges and Opportunities
While progress has been made on the continent, Africa still faces several challenges in fully harnessing the potential of AI. One significant obstacle is access to reliable Internet connectivity and affordable technology, which is limited in many parts of the continent.
Finally, despite these challenges, the continent is making significant progress in preparing for an AI-driven future.
