Despite still being in its infancy, artificial intelligence (AI) has already shown enormous potential to advance humanity towards new frontiers of prosperity and growth. Due to its powerful force, however, AI can also pose significant risks, which should be handled with the utmost care, but not with fear. The world’s top political leaders have understood AI’s disruptive potential and are rushing to secure a competitive advantage in this crucial emerging domain, even at the price of reviving old-fashioned industrial policy. At the same time, academia and civil society are calling for widely shared ethical principles to avoid negative repercussions.
In this fast-changing context, Europe is struggling to keep pace with superpowers like the United States and China.
This report summarises the work of the CEPS Task Force on Artificial Intelligence, which met throughout 2018. Arguing that the EU and its member states are uniquely positioned to lead the global community towards responsible, sustainable AI development, its members call upon European leaders to focus on leveraging AI’s potential to foster sustainable development in line with the 2030 Agenda.
The report puts forward 44 recommendations on how to design and promote lawful, responsible and sustainable AI and how to approach future policy and investment decisions with the aim of positioning Europe in the driver’s seat to address the most disruptive technology transition of our times.

Every Monday morning, artnet News brings you The Gray Market. The column decodes important stories from the previous week—and offers unparalleled insight into the inner workings of the art industry in the process.
This week, inspecting the brave new world of art and AI…
 
INTELLIGENT DESIGN
On Monday night, the Metropolitan Museum of Art unveiled a quintet of machine-learning-powered prototypes developed in partnership with MIT and Microsoft. According to the Met, the initiative’s goal is “to imagine and develop scalable new ways for global audiences to discover, learn, and create with one of the world’s foremost art collections through artificial intelligence.” My colleague Eileen Kinsella recapped the highlights the following day.
At the risk of sounding cynical, I don’t think any of the value propositions presented by the Met x Microsoft x MIT are going to blow your hair back. Worse than that, I think they encapsulate Big Tech’s continued mission to camouflage AI as either a light-hearted parlor trick or an unqualified good while it rams a crowbar into the socioeconomic divides already ripping apart 21st-century society.
Let me explain.
All told, the Met discussed five different applications, only one of which was operational. That application, Gen Studio, uses a Generative Adversarial Network, or GAN—the same basic software responsible for the artwork that makes me angrier than an aggrieved youth sports parent—to allows users to remix structurally related objects owned by the Met, then find close matches to the AI-generated hybrid in the museum’s collection. 
Personally, I think it’s a harmless distraction good for about 15 seconds of surplus curiosity. And compared to how I feel about the other four prototypes, that is high praise.

OVERSHARING
Gen Studio aside, the Met x Microsoft x MIT subtly aggregates AI’s greatest threats. Once complete, the remaining quartet of apps can only deliver its (meager) payoff if you give away either A) your personal data, or B) your labor. (As prototypes, none currently store or exchange user data.) All it takes to see this unsettling trade-off is a few italics added to copy from the Met’s webpage. 
Artwork of the Day will select one daily image intended to “resonate with you” based on “your location, weather, news, and historical data [italics mine]”; My Life, My Met “will use Microsoft AI to analyze your posts from Instagram and substitute the images with the closest matching Open Access artworks from the Met collection”; and Storyteller “uses voice recognition AI to follow the discussion and share artworks from the Met collection that resonate with the stories being told.” 
In other words, for each algorithm to work, you have to give it access to, respectively, where you are at any given moment; every image you’ve ever posted to the world’s most popular photo-sharing app; and both what your voice sounds like and what you’re talking about while the app is open. What could go wrong? 
I’m sure everyone involved in the collaboration will say user data is kept safe and only used to refine the prototypes themselves, not leveraged toward other goals. (After publication time, the Met responded to an email inquiry by promising a response from Microsoft.) But even if you ascribe the best intentions to everyone involved, do you believe them? It’s not as if Big Tech has given us much reason to consider its ringleaders hack-proof, bug-proof, or self-interest-proof lately. 
Then there’s the Met x Microsoft x MIT’s fifth and final prototype: Tag, That’s It! Beneath the exuberantly punctuated allusion to child’s play, the project provides an even more direct link to the grim stakes of AI than its brethren dependent on self-surveillance.

TURKING OVERTIME
The Met describes Tag, That’s It! as “a crowdsourcing means of fine-tuning subject keyword results generated by an AI model” for pieces in its collection. Translation: Users volunteer their time to apply keywords reflecting what’s shown in each image so that the algorithm can better learn to recognize subject matter, making the collection more easily searchable over time.
I expect the Met, Microsoft, and MIT would compare contributing to Tag, That’s It! to contributing to Wikipedia: an online labor of love that makes the community better. But the repetitive, borderline mindless nature of the task, as well as the AI endgame, actually makes users much more like Mechanical Turks. 
For those uninitiated into the boiler-room infrastructure of machine learning, “Mechanical Turk” is Amazon’s term for a flesh-and-blood laborer who repeatedly performs a task easy for humans but still difficult for machines, usually for extremely low compensation that incentivizes volume participation. (The name arises from an 18th-century hoax in which an alleged chess-playing “robot” was just a dude hidden inside an elaborate construction.)
Amazon runs an entire marketplace for Mechanical Turks, where “requesters” post listings for tasks they need done online and potential workers (“Turkers”) trawl the available options. Sample tasks include filling out surveys, transcribing recorded audio, and the job central to Tag, That’s It!: labeling image contents to gradually improve “computer vision,” or software’s ability to accurately parse the visual world into discrete components through machine learning. 
Turking is almost invariably paid at sub-minimum wage rates. Requesters can set a task’s payout as low as one cent. Since Amazon takes 20 percent of whatever requesters pay to Turkers, they also have incentive to minimize compensation and underestimate the time required to complete a task (another compulsory data point for any listing). 
The upshot for the laborers? A recent study by Cornell University found that the median payout per Turker hovers somewhere around two dollars an hour. This is legal because, like Uber drivers, Turkers qualify as independent contractors, freeing their employers from labor regulations such as a minimum wage, designated breaks, and health or vacation benefits. 
Still, the grand irony buried within this arena is that, when it comes to helping to train machine-learning algorithms, Turkers are literally incentivized to try to make themselves redundant as fast as possible. Which might seem like a good thing, until you survey the rest of the labor market—an increasingly apocalyptic hellscape scorched by the disruptive effects of automation and AI.

VICIOUS CYCLE
If you’re afraid of what AI will do to the global workforce in the future, start looking right in front of you. A 2017 Deloitte study determined that more than half of companies had already started using “robotic process automation,” also known as machine learning or AI, to replace at least some jobs previously handled by people, with nearly three-quarters expected to do the same by 2020. 
This push toward a software-dominant economy lends employers a certain Jekyll and Hyde quality. Here’s Kevin Roose summing up his experience with the issue at this year’s World Economic Forum in Davos:
In public, many executives wring their hands over the negative consequences that artificial intelligence and automation could have for workers…. But in private settings, these executives tell a different story: They are racing to automate their own work forces to stay ahead of the competition, with little regard for impact on the workers.
Tech evangelists and defenders have long argued that technological progress is nothing to fear, because the same advancements that eliminate old jobs will create new, better ones, just as happened in the Industrial Revolution. But as Eduardo Porter wrote in the New York Times this week…
Something different is going on in our current technological revolution. In a new study, David Autor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Anna Salomons of Utrecht University found that over the last 40 years, jobs have fallen in every single industry that introduced technologies to enhance productivity. The only reason employment didn’t fall across the entire economy is that other industries, with less productivity growth, picked up the slack. 
“Industries with less productivity growth” means industries (and thus, jobs) that are still basically the same as they’ve always been: food service, hospitality, eldercare, etc. I say “basically” because, as Porter reports from an increasingly class-divided Phoenix, Arizona, employers are generally only keeping these human-dependent industries going by slashing wages and benefits to minimize their costs. 
So the fact that there are jobs, period, papers over the fact that said jobs are not good—and getting worse. Yet even these hard-to-automate industries can’t keep up with the overall labor supply. So where else do the unemployed and underemployed turn? 
As relayed in a harrowing Atlantic piece by Alana Semuels, a recent Pew poll found that five percent of Americans made money by doing some amount of remote work through an online platform—about two and a half times more than drove for ride-sharing apps like Uber. And while not all this remote work is paid as poorly as Turking, the trend lines are pointing in the wrong direction. Siddarth Suri and Mary L. Gray, researchers focused on the unskilled gig economy (the one powered by on-demand marketplaces like TaskRabbit, AirBnB, and Uber), recently estimated that up to one-third of Americans may join its ranks within the next 10 years. 
All of which creates a vicious cycle: AI makes elites and the highly skilled wealthier by usurping more and more once-decent jobs; unskilled or low-skilled workers retreat to unforgiving service industries; and failing that, they turn to even less forgiving on-demand, online-enabled work that elites are racing to usurp with AI, sometimes with the workers’ labor hastening their own obsolescence.

CONNECTING THE DOTS
What does all this have to do with the Met x Microsoft x MIT? On one level, not much. Even once the initiative’s entire quintet of AI prototypes goes live, I doubt the collective user base will move the needle on Silicon Valley’s quest to harvest enough data and cheap labor to supercharge machine learning into a workforce-reshaping productivity juggernaut. 
But on another level, the collaboration typifies the soft-peddling of AI’s concussive impact on the average citizen. It entices us to imagine how machine learning could “connect people through art,” to quote the Met’s copy… while offering nothing more than a few weak software freebies for personal data and unpaid labor. This uneven exchange sets a dangerous precedent by encouraging behaviors and expectations central to AI’s disruption of modern employment, class, and quality of life. It’s like being enthralled by a street magician while his accomplice empties your wallet.
In this way, the Met’s AI initiative invites the art world to once again turn so completely inward that it misses the larger issues at the crux of the latest spectacle. My advice? Pulp the invitation.

Artificial intelligence is coming to your inbox. A Finnish company has rolled out a new product that lets potential employers scan the private emails of job applicants to determine whether or not they would be a good fit for the organization.
The company, Digital Minds, portrays its offering as something innocuous. If applicants give their consent, what’s the harm?
The truth is: We don’t know the answer to that question. And that’s what makes new, potentially intrusive and discriminatory technologies like this one so scary.

The product skims a job applicant’s private conversations to compute an assessment of his or her psychological traits using IBM Watson’s Personality Insights. The result is a profile of the candidate, based on the so-called Big Five personality traits — openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism — that gives the potential employer an assessment of whether the person in question would be a good fit at his or her company.
Digital Minds, started by two young Finns in 2017, claims it has carried out thousands of assessments for dozens of clients so far, and that it is fully compliant with the European Union’s strict data protection and privacy legislation, known as GDPR.
Digital Minds’ email-scanning tool is an example of a growing reliance on automatic-decision-making.
There are some obvious advantages to a tool like this. Current hiring methods are far from perfect, as considering resumés and conducting face-to-face interviews leaves plenty of room for discrimination. Interviews especially tend to assess a candidate’s likability to the interviewer, rather than his or her ability to work efficiently in an organization.
Research conducted at the University of California, Berkeley — based on monitoring a company’s internal exchanges over six years — also found that language used in emails could successfully predict an employee’s career path. Those who, based on a linguistic analysis of their emails, did not fit in with the culture of the company, were much more likely to leave the company — whether voluntarily or not — and less likely to be promoted internally.
No studies have been done to assess the predictive power of the private emails, but it is plausible that doing so could be equally successful. A tool that replaced face-to-face interviews with something cheaper, more reliable and less susceptible to personal bias could indeed lead to better hiring results.

Of course, no tool would be fool-proof. If the practice of looking at prospective employees’ private inboxes became widespread, it’s likely that online tools would pop up to help candidates adapt their inboxes to fit their target employers’ culture or expectations.

This product could also prove to be illegal. In Finland, employers are barred from collecting personal data about employees or job applicants that is not directly relevant to a specific task, even if the person in question gives his or her consent. Whether using private emails to create a psychometric profile constitutes collection of personal data is still unclear, as is legislation regarding the arbitrariness of the procedure.
The EU’s data protection regulation also forbids decisions “based solely on automated processing” if they produce “legal effects” on someone — wording that’s convoluted enough to leave too much room for interpretation.
But that’s not the real danger of tools like this one. Digital Minds’ email-scanning tool is an example of a growing reliance on automatic-decision-making. Increasingly, we are taking the power out of hands of humans and entrusting it to algorithms that make decisions on criteria we haven’t decided upon. The opacity in exactly how they make those decisions is what poses the biggest risk from these new technologies and approaches.
Not even the most data-driven companies can reliably predict the outcome of self-learning systems like the one developed by Digital Minds. Amazon, for example, ditched a self-developed recruiting system because it discriminated against women. To their credit, Amazon’s staff scrutinized their own tool and noticed the problem themselves. But not every company is likely to be as rigorous.
As long as automated decision-making remains a black box, there is no way for employers, or even programmers, to know the basis on which it is making its judgement. Is the algorithm looking for key words related to union activity, family planning, sexual preferences or other traits employers might find undesirable? Has a job seeker been rejected on the basis of a past action, gender, religious belief or political affiliation? We don’t know.

Unless we ensure these products are more transparent, people will lose trust in the companies and governments that use them.
The arbitrariness of tools like this could elicit a significant backlash among citizens, especially as automatic decision-making starts to have important effects on people’s lives.
That’s already starting to happen across Europe. France has a vast system of automated speed controls; authorities in Denmark have developed a tool to automatically identify children at risk of neglect; and in Italy, treatment for patients in the public health system is allocated on the basis of automated data analysis.
The Netherlands relies on a system of “risk indication” to detect welfare fraud (it is currently subject to a legal challenge), and in Slovenia, teachers in some schools rely on automated tools to detect “problematic” students. In Poland, the ministry of justice last year introduced a system that, once a day, automatically assigns cases to judges across the country “without emotions” or “bias.”
These tools may be developed with the best intentions in mind. But unless we ensure these products are more transparent, people will lose trust in the companies and governments that use them.

Citizens also need to have appropriate recourse to contest these automated decisions and hold to account those who rely on them, no matter if they are public administration or private companies. Dumping source code online, as some governments do, is not enough.

There are examples of how best to scrutinize these systems. New York City, for example, created a commission to identify systems of automated decision-making in use by the administration and review them “through the lens of equity, fairness and accountability.”
It is high time European governments — whether national, regional or local — take a page out of their book and make sure they understand, and legislate for, how automatic decision-making is reshaping our world.

She explores wide-ranging topics like climate change, artificial intelligence, vaccine development, and factory farms, and also writes the Future Perfect newsletter.One of the coolest AI systems I’ve ever seen may also be the one that will kick me out of my job.Earlier this week, I attended a demo with a research team at OpenAI, the San Francisco nonprofit that’s right up there with top tech companies in conducting impressive new research on the frontiers of AI. The system they showed me was a language-learning model that writes the news, answers reading comprehension problems, and is beginning to show promise at tasks like translation.In a paper released Thursday, the OpenAI team demonstrates that we can get those results from an “unsupervised” AI — meaning the system learned from reading 8 million internet articles, not from being explicitly trained for the tasks. Their AI advances the state of the art — in some cases, by a lot. The OpenAI team says their system sets a record for performance on so-called Winograd schemas, a tough reading comprehension task; achieves near-human performance on the Children’s Book Test, another check of reading comprehension; and — most thrillingly to me — generates its own text, including highly convincing news articles and Amazon reviews.Here’s what happens when you give the system a one-sentence prompt and invite it to write the rest of this article:The AI selects words one at a time and then considers what the next one should be. It takes a few seconds to add sentences.It’s by no means perfect:The prose is pretty rough, there’s the occasional non-sequitur, and the articles get less coherent the longer they get. “The model still does seem to drift off topic eventually, and the output is capped at a few hundred words,” Sam Bowman, who works on natural language processing and computational linguistics at NYU, told me in an email.And to be clear, while the AI can write news articles that are sometimes convincing enough that I wouldn’t be surprised to see them in the newspaper, it can’t write true news articles; the quotes and statistics are all made up.Advantage humanjournalists —for now.We’re seeing the potential of “unsupervised” learningWe’ve made huge strides in natural language processing over the past decade. Translation has improved, becoming high-quality enough that you can read news articles in other languages. Google demonstrated last summer that Google Assistant can make phone calls and book appointments while sounding just like a human (though the company promised it won’t use deceptive tactics in practice).AI systems are seeing similarly impressive gains outside natural language processing. New techniques — and more computing power — have allowed researchers to invent photorealistic images, excel at two-player games like Go, and compete with the pros in strategy video games like Starcraft and DOTA.But even for those of us who are used to seeing fast progress in this space, the latest release from OpenAI is pretty impressive.Until now, researchers trying to get world-record results on language tasks would “fine-tune” their models to perform well on the specific task in question — that is, the AI would be trained for each task.The OpenAI system, called GPT-2, needed no fine-tuning: It turned in a record-setting performance at lots of the core tasks we use to judge language AIs, without ever having seen those tasks before and without being specifically trained to handle them. It also started to demonstrate some talent for reading comprehension, summarization, and translation with no explicit training in those tasks.GPT-2 is the result of an approach called “unsupervised learning.” Here’s what that means. The predominant approach in industry today is “supervised learning.” That’s where you have large, carefully labeled data sets that contain desired inputs and desired outputs. You teach the AI how to produce the outputs given the inputs.That can get great results, but it requires building huge data sets and carefully labeling each bit of data. And it’s worth noting thatsupervised learning isn’t how humans acquire skills and knowledge. We make inferences about the world without the carefully delineated examples from supervised learning.Many people believe that advances in general AI capabilities will require advances in unsupervised learning — that is, where the AI just gets exposed to lots of data and has to figure out everything else itself. Unsupervised learning is easier to scale since there’s lots more unstructured data than there is structured data, and unsupervised learning may generalize better across tasks.Learning to read like a humanOne task that OpenAI used to test the capabilities of GPT-2 is a famous test in machine learning known as the Winograd schema test. A Winograd schema is a sentence that’s grammatically ambiguous but not ambiguous to humans — because we have the context to interpret it.For example, take the sentence: “The trophy doesn’t fit in the brown suitcase because it’s too big.”To a human reader, it’s obvious that this means the trophy is too big, not that the suitcase is too big, because we know how objects fitting into other objects works. AI systems, though, struggle with questions like these.Before this paper, state-of-the-art AIs that can solve Winograd schemas got them right 63.7 percent of the time, OpenAI says. (Humans almost never get them wrong.) GPT-2 gets these right 70.7 percent of the time. That’s still well short of human-level performance, but it’s a striking gain over what was previously possible.GPT-2 set records on other language tasks, too. LAMBADA is a task that tests a computer’s ability to use context mentioned earlier in a story in order to complete a sentence. The previous best performance had 56.25 percent accuracy; GPT-2 achieved 63.24 percent accuracy. (Again, humans get these right more than 95 percent of the time, so AI hasn’t replaced us yet — but this is a substantial jump in capabilities.)One skeptical perspective on text-generation AI systems, Bowman pointed out, is that “models like this can sometimes look deceptively good by just repeating the exact texts that they were trained on.” For example, it’s easy to have coherent paragraphs if you’re plagiarizing whole paragraphs from other sources. But that’s not what’s going on here: “This is set up in a way that it can’t really be doing that.” Since it selects one word at a time, it’s not plagiarizing.Another skeptical perspective on AI advances like this one is that they don’t reflect “deep” advances in our understanding of computer systems, just shallow improvements that come from being able to use more data and more computing power. Critics argue that almost everything heralded as an AI advance is really just incremental progress from adding more computing power to existing approaches.The team at OpenAI contested that. GPT-2 uses a newly invented neural network design called the Transformer, invented 18 months ago by researchers at Google Brain. Some of the gains in performance are certainly thanks to more data and more computing power, but they’re also driven by powerful recent innovations in the field — as we’d expect if AI as a field is improving on all fronts.“It’s more data, more compute, cheaper compute, and architectural improvements — designed by researchers at Google about a year and a half ago,” OpenAI researcher Jeffrey Wu told me. “We just want to try everything and see where the actual results take us.”Is the era of fake news about to get even worse?The team at OpenAI is making the unusual choice not to release their system publicly for everyone to interact with. That’s too bad — take it from me, it’s incredibly fun to try out — but they have a very good reason.OpenAI has been active in trying to figure out how to limit the potential for misuse of AI, and they’ve concluded that in some cases, the right solution is limiting what they publish.With a tool like this, for example, it’d be easy to spoof Amazon reviews and pump out fake news articles in a fraction of the time a human would need. A slightly more sophisticated version might be good enough to let students generate plagiarized essays and spammers improve their messaging to targets.“I’m worried about trolly 4chan actors generating arbitrarily large amounts of garbage opinion content that’s sexist and racist,” OpenAI policy director Jack Clark told me. He also worries about “actors who do stuff like disinformation, who are more sophisticated,” and points out that there might be other avenues for misuse we haven’t yet thought of. So they’re keeping the tool offline, at least for now, while everyone can weigh in on how to use AIs like these safely. (There’s a smaller version publicly available to try.)OpenAI’s generative language AI writes an article about a snowstorm. GPT-2 demo environment courtesy of OpenAI; image by Javier Zarracina/VoxThis story about a snowstorm in the Northeast — complete with invented quotes from local authorities — took about 10 seconds to “write.”Of course, keeping some capabilities private might have fairly little effect. “I’m confident that a single person working alone with enough compute resources could reproduce these results within a month or two (either a hobbyist with a lot of equipment and time, or more likely, researchers at a tech company),” Bowman wrote me. “Given that it is standard practice to make models public, this decision is only delaying the release of models like this by a short time.” And keeping capabilities private has drawbacks — it makes it harder for the general public to independently evaluate the work that’s being done.“We want to communicate about what we’ve done in a responsible manner that empowers other important stakeholders, like journalists and policymakers, to also understand and verify what we’ve done,” Clark wrote me. That’s a balance that will take some practice to strike appropriately, but they think that this discovery — with all its potential to be a dangerous tool for fake news — is the right place to start investigating how to strike it.While they’re not making the language generator itself available online, the team at OpenAI gave me access to it so I could check out their results and write this piece.So, of course, I did the obvious — I asked OpenAI’s new language AI to finish up this article for me.“OpenAI released a new language model called GPT-2 which surpasses state-of-the-art on a variety of tasks,” I prompted it. Over the next 15 seconds, the AI expanded on that for me.Skeptics say that language models cannot do reasoning, but GPT-2 is proving far more powerful than even the best artificial intelligence models can. [...]GPT-2 is not perfect — not even the best AI models are — but it is improving with each passing day. As the technology progresses, the more complex it becomes to build models. AI researchers continue to create models for tasks like image recognition and machine vision. [...]It went on:Artificial intelligence is changing our lives in the fastest and most positive way possible. Artificial intelligence will allow intelligent robots and computers to work alongside us, and can even give us the ability to work alongside other intelligent agents, whether they will be humans or machines.The AI ended on a positive note — or, depending on how you look at it, a terrifying one:This is the future, and the field of AI is going places we could only have guessed at.Sign up for the Future Perfect newsletter.

Applying just a bit of strain to a piece of semiconductor or other crystalline material can deform the orderly arrangement of atoms in its structure enough to cause dramatic changes in its properties, such as the way it conducts electricity, transmits light, or conducts heat.
Now, a team of researchers at MIT and in Russia and Singapore have found ways to use artificial intelligence to help predict and control these changes, potentially opening up new avenues of research on advanced materials for future high-tech devices.
The findings appear this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, in a paper authored by MIT professor of nuclear science and engineering and of materials science and engineering Ju Li, MIT Principal Research Scientist Ming Dao, and MIT graduate student Zhe Shi, with Evgenii Tsymbalov and Alexander Shapeev at the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology in Russia, and Subra Suresh, the Vannevar Bush Professor Emeritus and former dean of engineering at MIT and current president of Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.
Already, based on earlier work at MIT, some degree of elastic strain has been incorporated in some silicon processor chips. Even a 1 percent change in the structure can in some cases improve the speed of the device by 50 percent, by allowing electrons to move through the material faster.
Recent research by Suresh, Dao, and Yang Lu, a former MIT postdoc now at City University of Hong Kong, showed that even diamond, the strongest and hardest material found in nature, can be elastically stretched by as much as 9 percent without failure when it is in the form of nanometer-sized needles. Li and Yang similarly demonstrated that nanoscale wires of silicon can be stretched purely elastically by more than 15 percent.  These discoveries have opened up new avenues to explore how devices can be fabricated with even more dramatic changes in the materials’ properties.
Strain made to order
Unlike other ways of changing a material’s properties, such as chemical doping, which produce a permanent, static change, strain engineering allows properties to be changed on the fly. “Strain is something you can turn on and off dynamically,” Li says.
But the potential of strain-engineered materials has been hampered by the daunting range of possibilities. Strain can be applied in any of six different ways (in three different dimensions, each one of which can produce strain in-and-out or sideways), and with nearly infinite gradations of degree, so the full range of possibilities is impractical to explore simply by trial and error. “It quickly grows to 100 million calculations if we want to map out the entire elastic strain space,” Li says.
That’s where this team’s novel application of machine learning methods comes to the rescue, providing a systematic way of exploring the possibilities and homing in on the appropriate amount and direction of strain to achieve a given set of properties for a particular purpose. “Now we have this very high-accuracy method” that drastically reduces the complexity of the calculations needed, Li says.
“This work is an illustration of how recent advances in seemingly distant fields such as material physics, artificial intelligence, computing, and machine learning can be brought together to advance scientific knowledge that has strong implications for industry application,” Suresh says.
The new method, the researchers say, could open up possibilities for creating materials tuned precisely for electronic, optoelectronic, and photonic devices that could find uses for communications, information processing, and energy applications.

The team studied the effects of strain on the bandgap, a key electronic property of semiconductors, in both silicon and diamond. Using their neural network algorithm, they were able to predict with high accuracy how different amounts and orientations of strain would affect the bandgap.
“Tuning” of a bandgap can be a key tool for improving the efficiency of a device, such as a silicon solar cell, by getting it to match more precisely the kind of energy source that it is designed to harness. By fine-tuning its bandgap, for example, it may be possible to make a silicon solar cell that is just as effective at capturing sunlight as its counterparts but is only one-thousandth as thick. In theory, the material “can even change from a semiconductor to a metal, and that would have many applications, if that’s doable in a mass-produced product,” Li says.
While it’s possible in some cases to induce similar changes by other means, such as putting the material in a strong electric field or chemically altering it, those changes tend to have many side effects on the material’s behavior, whereas changing the strain has fewer such side effects. For example, Li explains, an electrostatic field often interferes with the operation of the device because it affects the way electricity flows through it. Changing the strain produces no such interference.
Diamond’s potential
Diamond has great potential as a semiconductor material, though it’s still in its infancy compared to silicon technology. “It’s an extreme material, with high carrier mobility,” Li says, referring to the way negative and positive carriers of electric current move freely through diamond. Because of that, diamond could be ideal for some kinds of high-frequency electronic devices and for power electronics.
By some measures, Li says, diamond could potentially perform 100,000 times better than silicon. But it has other limitations, including the fact that nobody has yet figured out a good and scalable way to put diamond layers on a large substrate. The material is also difficult to “dope,” or introduce other atoms into, a key part of semiconductor manufacturing.
By mounting the material in a frame that can be adjusted to change the amount and orientation of the strain, Dao says, “we can have considerable flexibility” in altering its dopant behavior.
Whereas this study focused specifically on the effects of strain on the materials’ bandgap, “the method is generalizable” to other aspects, which affect not only electronic properties but also other properties such as photonic and magnetic behavior, Li says. From the 1 percent strain now being used in commercial chips, many new applications open up now that this team has shown that strains of nearly 10 percent are possible without fracturing. “When you get to more than 7 percent strain, you really change a lot in the material,” he says.
“This new method could potentially lead to the design of unprecedented material properties,” Li says. “But much further work will be needed to figure out how to impose the strain and how to scale up the process to do it on 100 million transistors on a chip [and ensure that] none of them can fail.”
“This innovative new work demonstrates potential to significantly accelerate the engineering of exotic electronic properties in ordinary materials via large elastic strains,” says Evan Reed, an associate professor of materials science and engineering at Stanford University, who was not involved in this research. “It sheds light on the opportunities and limitations that nature exhibits for such strain engineering, and it will be of interest to a broad spectrum of researchers working on important technologies.”
The work was supported by the MIT-Skoltech program and Nanyang Technological University.

Well, on several missions: the French mathematician, winner of the 2010 Fields Medal – often described as maths’ Nobel Prize – sits as an MP for Emmanuel Macron’s party La République en Marche, teaches at the University of Lyon, and is running for the Paris 2020 mayoralty. But the expert in mathematical analysis, famous for his academic achievements as well as for wearing spider-shaped pins on his three-piece suits, has a bigger goal: making France a leader in artificial intelligence.AdChoicesADVERTISEMENTAppointed by the French president to set out a national AI strategy, in 2018 Villani published a report, “AI for Humanity”, setting clear lines for the sector: “We must valorise our research, define our industrial priorities, work on the ethical and legal framework and on AI training,” Villani says, sat among his spiders – one as big a pillow – in his office.Trending NowChatGPT Answers the Web's Most Searched QuestionsFollowing the report’s publication, President Macron announced an investment of €1.5bn, over four years, to implement most of Villani’s propositions. “I want France to be one of the leaders of the AI sector,” Macron said. “We have the means, and we will create the conditions.”Villani identified four sectors to prioritise: health, defence, transport, and the environment. From early detection of pathologies to green urban mobility, AI can be used for “common good”, Villani concluded in the report, and recommended the creation of open data platforms for each sector. Data on energy, transport, agriculture, biodiversity, climate, agriculture and much more could help all four sectors, for example by forecasting traffic peaks, pollution, floods, and allowing a better organisation of French public life.About 95 per cent of his propositions are being implemented by the government, Villani says; health is the sector in which the creation of the data platform is most advanced. But Villani estimates that the number of AI students must be tripled to answer the sector’s needs. The government is aiming to double it, and wants at least 40 per cent of researchers to be female. “We’re currently very far from these goals. It’s going to take very voluntarist actions,” Villani says.AdvertisementResearch is expected to play a pivotal role in Villani’s plan. On November 6, 2018, the minister for Research and Innovation, Frédérique Vidal, announced the creation of four “interdisciplinary AI institutes”, or “3IA”, in Paris, Toulouse, Grenoble and Nice, where academics and industrials will work together on AI projects around local priorities in health, education, robotics, the environment and public policy.For the 3IA to be a success, France will need to retain talent. On Villani’s advice, the government is now trying to stem the scientific “brain drain”: to retain world-class French mathematicians, algorithmics experts and statisticians, who often leave low-paying roles in France for the US or China, a new law will allow them to take on better-paid consultancy work, for a maximum of 50 per cent of their time. Villani also suggested doubling researchers’ salaries, but the government turned that recommendation down. To Nozha Boujemaa, the research director at the National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation, which will coordinate the 3IA project, this is a problem: “We won’t be competitive enough,” she says.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDSecurityAT&T Paid a Hacker $370,000 to Delete Stolen Phone RecordsBy Kim Zetter, WIREDThe €1.5bn budget allocated by Macron shows France’s limits on competitiveness, too. “One billion is less than a regional budget in the US or China,” Boujemaa says. Villani knows France can’t compete with Chinese investment – the city of Tianjin alone has a £11.6bn AI budget – but it’s not about France, he says: it’s about Europe. “France will do nothing in the AI sector without Europe. We need networks of researchers and institutes throughout Europe, to work with each other’s strengths and good practices.” For this reason, Villani, finds Brexit “tragic”.“At a moment when we need all European skills, in a context of harsh competition worldwide, it is regrettable to lose the UK’s remarkable expertise. It is in France and the UK’s best interest to keep close links in the AI sector.”France may not become the AI leader, but it can become an AI leader. Villani’s biggest challenge isn’t budget or international competition: it’s changing the cultural mindset. He gives the example of two French ministry services where an algorithm was tested to improve the office’s operations. Although its efficacy was proved, one test was stopped quickly, and Villani expects the other to stop, too, because people were wary of the changes introduced by AI. “It’s about cultural adaptation, about the whole engine being in the same mindset,” he says. “We must convince everyone to cooperate.”This article was originally published by WIRED UKEnter your email to get the Wired newsletterclose dialogRecommended NewsletterFast ForwardA weekly dispatch from the future by Will Knight, exploring advances in AI and other technologies set to change our lives.

The human doctors lost.Credit...Mark Schiefelbein/Associated PressBy Cade MetzFeb. 11, 2019Leer en españolEach year, millions of Americans walk out of a doctor’s office with a misdiagnosis. Physicians try to be systematic when identifying illness and disease, but bias creeps in. Alternatives are overlooked.Now a group of researchers in the United States and China has tested a potential remedy for all-too-human frailties: artificial intelligence.In a paper published on Monday in Nature Medicine, the scientists reported that they had built a system that automatically diagnoses common childhood conditions — from influenza to meningitis — after processing the patient’s symptoms, history, lab results and other clinical data.The system was highly accurate, the researchers said, and one day may assist doctors in diagnosing complex or rare conditions.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTDrawing on the records of nearly 600,000 Chinese patients who had visited a pediatric hospital over an 18-month period, the vast collection of data used to train this new system highlights an advantage for China in the worldwide race toward artificial intelligence.Because its population is so large — and because its privacy norms put fewer restrictions on the sharing of digital data — it may be easier for Chinese companies and researchers to build and train the “deep learning” systems that are rapidly changing the trajectory of health care.On Monday, President Trump signed an executive order meant to spur the development of A.I. across government, academia and industry in the United States. As part of this “American A.I. Initiative,” the administration will encourage federal agencies and universities to share data that can drive the development of automated systems.Pooling health care data is a particularly difficult endeavor. Whereas researchers went to a single Chinese hospital for all the data they needed to develop their artificial-intelligence system, gathering such data from American facilities is rarely so straightforward.“You have go to multiple places,” said Dr. George Shih, associate professor of clinical radiology at Weill Cornell Medical Center and co-founder of MD.ai, a company that helps researchers label data for A.I. services. “The equipment is never the same. You have to make sure the data is anonymized. Even if you get permission, it is a massive amount of work.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAfter reshaping internet services, consumer devices and driverless cars in the early part of the decade, deep learning is moving rapidly into myriad areas of health care. Many organizations, including Google, are developing and testing systems that analyze electronic health records in an effort to flag medical conditions such as osteoporosis, diabetes, hypertension and heart failure.Similar technologies are being built to automatically detect signs of illness and disease in X-rays, M.R.I.s and eye scans.The new system relies on a neural network, a breed of artificial intelligence that is accelerating the development of everything from health care to driverless cars to military applications. A neural network can learn tasks largely on its own by analyzing vast amounts of data.Using the technology, Dr. Kang Zhang, chief of ophthalmic genetics at the University of California, San Diego, has built systems that can analyze eye scans for hemorrhages, lesions and other signs of diabetic blindness. Ideally, such systems would serve as a first line of defense, screening patients and pinpointing those who need further attention.Now Dr. Zhang and his colleagues have created a system that can diagnose an even wider range of conditions by recognizing patterns in text, not just in medical images. This may augment what doctors can do on their own, he said.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“In some situations, physicians cannot consider all the possibilities,” he said. “This system can spot-check and make sure the physician didn’t miss anything.”The experimental system analyzed the electronic medical records of nearly 600,000 patients at the Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center in southern China, learning to associate common medical conditions with specific patient information gathered by doctors, nurses and other technicians.First, a group of trained physicians annotated the hospital records, adding labels that identified information related to certain medical conditions. The system then analyzed the labeled data.Then the neural network was given new information, including a patient’s symptoms as determined during a physical examination. Soon it was able to make connections on its own between written records and observed symptoms.When tested on unlabeled data, the software could rival the performance of experienced physicians. It was more than 90 percent accurate at diagnosing asthma; the accuracy of physicians in the study ranged from 80 to 94 percent.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIn diagnosing gastrointestinal disease, the system was 87 percent accurate, compared with the physicians’ accuracy of 82 to 90 percent.Able to recognize patterns in data that humans could never identify on their own, neural networks can be enormously powerful in the right situation. But even experts have difficulty understanding why such networks make particular decisions and how they teach themselves.As a result, extensive testing is needed to reassure both doctors and patients that these systems are reliable.Experts said extensive clinical trials are now needed for Dr. Zhang’s system, given the difficulty of interpreting decisions made by neural networks.“Medicine is a slow-moving field,” said Ben Shickel, a researcher at the University of Florida who specializes in the use of deep learning for health care. “No one is just going to deploy one of these techniques without rigorous testing that shows exactly what is going on.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIt could be years before deep-learning systems are deployed in emergency rooms and clinics. But some are closer to real-world use: Google is now running clinical trials of its eye-scan system at two hospitals in southern India.Deep-learning diagnostic tools are more likely to flourish in countries outside the United States, Dr. Zhang said. Automated screening systems may be particularly useful in places where doctors are scarce, including in India and China.The system built by Dr. Zhang and his colleagues benefited from the large scale of the data set gathered from the hospital in Guangzhou. Similar data sets from American hospitals are typically smaller, both because the average hospital is smaller and because regulations make it difficult to pool data from multiple facilities.Dr. Zhang said he and his colleagues were careful to protect patients’ privacy in the new study. But he acknowledged that researchers in China may have an advantage when it comes to collecting and analyzing this kind of data.“The sheer size of the population — the sheer size of the data — is a big difference,” he said.A version of this article appears in print on Feb. 12, 2019, Section B, Page 1 of the New York edition with the headline: In China, Training A.I.

What is big news is how resoundingly it might improve on traditional methods. It’s not exactly breaking news that biopharma companies are increasingly turning toward machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to improve drug development. What is big news is how resoundingly it might improve on traditional methods. This was recently demonstrated by the results of the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) contest hosted by the Protein Structure Prediction Center, sponsored by the U.S. National Institute of General Medical Sciences I(NIH/NIGMS). CASP is a worldwide contest, or perhaps experiment is a better word, that has taken place every two years since 1994. Proteins have three-dimensional structures and those structures are an important element in how they function—it’s not uncommon, for example, for a mutation in the gene for a protein to result in the protein having a different shape, causing it to behave abnormally or not at all. And another fact to keep in mind is that protein shapes are dynamic, not necessarily static, transitioning between different states. Every two years, the participants attempt to predict the 3-D shape of a specific human protein. Researchers focused on this type of research work to solve the problem using a variety of methods. Most recently, CASP wasn’t won by a biologist or biochemist, but by DeepMind, the AI laboratory owned by Google/Alphabet. Mohammed AlQuraishi, a biologist at Harvard Medical School who participated in the contest, told The New York Times, “I was surprised and deflated. They were way out in front of everyone else.” DeepMind didn’t just beat out the other scientists but gave a prediction that was almost twice as accurate as experts expected. A77B545F-2C28-4856-8EBC-88BE5BD90DCB.png Derek Lowe, who writes the In The Pipeline blog for Science Translational Medicine, told The Times, “It is not that machines are going to replace chemists. It’s that the chemists who use machines will replace those that don’t.” In his own blog, AlQuraishi criticized big pharma companies and the academic community for not keeping up. “The smartest and most ambitious researchers wanting to work on protein structure will look to DeepMind for opportunities instead of Merck or Novartis,” he wrote. “This fact should send chills down the spines of pharma executives, but it won’t because they’re clueless, rudderless, and asleep at the helm.” Merck, though, is exploring protein folding, but the company’s scientists think its impact is far down the road. It’s using deep learning algorithms on other aspects of drug discovery and development. Juan Alvarez, associate vice president of computational and structural chemistry at Merck told The Times, “We have to connect so many other dots.” Also, very few if any academic institutions can afford the resources like DeepMind, and large biopharma companies aren’t likely to devote that much of their finite resources to one approach. Google acquired DeepMind in 2014 for a reported $650 million. And other companies are focusing on AI and machine learning. Recursion Pharmaceuticals, headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, is a clinical-stage biotech company that combines AI, experimental biology and automation to discover and develop drugs at scale. On Jan. 7, 2019, Recursion announced progress in its collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical on identifying novel preclinical candidates for rare diseases. In 18 months, the partnership had led to the evaluation of Takeda preclinical and clinical compounds in more than 60 unique indications, with new therapeutic candidates identified in more than half-a-dozen diseases. As a result, Takeda exercised its option for drug candidates in two rare diseases and the two companies have extended the partnership. Also in January, Recursion signed a licensing deal with the Ohio State Innovation Foundation (OSIF), acquiring rights to OSU-HDAC42, a clinical stage compound that will be developed by Recursion for neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), a rare tumor syndrome. San Francisco-based Atomwise is using AI technology based on convolutional neural networks, the same tech used in facial recognition tech and self-driving cars, to search for drugs. On Jan. 11, 2019, Atomwise inked a strategic alliance with contract research organization (CRO) Charles River Laboratories International. Atomwise will support CRL’s hit discovery, hit-to-lead, and lead optimization efforts. Atomwise has a number of partnerships, including with AbbVie, the University of Toronto, Merck, Duke University School of Medicine and others. At the World Medical Innovation Forum held in Boston in April 2018, panelists focused on the use of AI in healthcare. In particular, AI can be used in clinical trials to search old clinical trial data for new applications and potentially replace part of clinical trials with “virtual” models. At that meeting, Joseph Scheeren, a senior advisor for R&D at Bayer, noted that cleaning data after a clinical trial can take one or two months. But AI, on the other hand, could potentially do it in a single day. He estimated that AI could reduce the time required for a clinical trial by 30 to 40 percent. “In R&D,” he said, “speed is everything.” And the same month, London-based BenevolentAI, which uses AI to develop new medicines, brought in $115 million in new investments. Since its founding in November 2013, the company has raised $207 million, according to Crunchbase. In September 2017, Vivek Ramaswamy launched another “vant” company, Datavant, which will use AI to improve clinical trials. It’s led by Travis May, co-founder and chief executive officer of LiveRamp, which offers data analysis across their ecosystem. And in July 2017, GlaxoSmithKline signed a $43 million deal with AI company Excientia to stimulate drug development. GSK indicated it would use AI to discover novel and select molecules for up to 10 disease-related targets across multiple therapeutic areas. So, it’s clear that biopharma is taking AI seriously. Jeremy Jenkins, head of data science for chemical biology and therapeutics at Novartis, told The Times, “Everyone is trending up in this area. It is like turning a big ship, and I think these methods will eventually scale to the size of our entire company.”', 'articleSection': 'Business, News', 'author': [{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'Person', '@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/mark-terry/#person', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/mark-terry/'}, 'name': 'Mark Terry', 'url': 'https://www.biospace.com/mark-terry'}], 'copyrightYear': '2024', 'datePublished': '2019-02-08T17:39:08.000Z', 'dateModified': '2019-02-11T15:41:11.000Z', 'headline': 'Artificial Intelligence Gaining Ground in Drug Development', '@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/artificial-intelligence-gaining-ground-in-drug-development/#article', 'image': [{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 350, 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'url': 'https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/aa2d660/2147483647/strip/false/crop/625x350+0+0/resize/625x350!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Flegacy%2FBioSpace-Assets%2F6542F7E9-27C9-4FD2-AC76-38227F87FA2D.jpg', 'height': 625}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 675, 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'url': 'https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/fac8f78/2147483647/strip/false/crop/622x350+1+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Flegacy%2FBioSpace-Assets%2F6542F7E9-27C9-4FD2-AC76-38227F87FA2D.jpg', 'height': 1200}], 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/artificial-intelligence-gaining-ground-in-drug-development/#webpage'}, 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/artificial-intelligence-gaining-ground-in-drug-development/#webpage'}}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'Organization'}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'Website', 'inLanguage': 'en-US'}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'WebPage', 'potentialAction': [{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ReadAction', 'target': 'https://www.biospace.com/artificial-intelligence-gaining-ground-in-drug-development'}], 'breadcrumb': {'@type': 'BreadcrumbList', 'itemListElement': [{'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ListItem', 'item': 'https://www.biospace.com/news', 'name': 'News', 'position': 1}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ListItem', 'item': 'https://www.biospace.com/business', 'name': 'Business', 'position': 2}]}, '@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/artificial-intelligence-gaining-ground-in-drug-development/#webpage', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'primaryImageOfPage': {'@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/artificial-intelligence-gaining-ground-in-drug-development/#primaryimage'}, 'name': 'Artificial Intelligence Gaining Ground in Drug Development', 'datePublished': '2019-02-08T17:39:08.000Z', 'dateModified': '2019-02-11T15:41:11.000Z', 'url': 'https://www.biospace.com/artificial-intelligence-gaining-ground-in-drug-development'}, {'@context': 'http://schema.org', '@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': 675, '@id': 'https://www.biospace.com/artificial-intelligence-gaining-ground-in-drug-development/#primaryimage', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'url': 'https://static.biospace.com/dims4/default/fac8f78/2147483647/strip/false/crop/622x350+1+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-biospace.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Flegacy%2FBioSpace-Assets%2F6542F7E9-27C9-4FD2-AC76-38227F87FA2D.jpg', 'height': 1200}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BOT or NOT? This special series explores the evolving relationship between humans and machines, examining the ways that robots, artificial intelligence and automation are impacting our work and lives.

The White House is moving forward with the American AI Initiative, a set of policies aimed at focusing the full resources of the federal government on the frontiers of artificial intelligence.
President Donald Trump signed an executive order launching the initiative today. Among its provisions is a call for federal agencies to prioritize AI in their research and development missions, and to prioritize fellowship and training programs to help American workers gain AI-relevant skills.
The initiative also directs agencies to make federal data, models and computing resources more available to academic and industry researchers, “while maintaining the security and confidentiality protections we all expect.”
“This action will drive our top-notch AI research toward new technological breakthroughs and promote scientific discovery, economic competitiveness and national security,” the White House said in a statement.
As a trust-building measure, federal agencies are being asked to establish regulatory guidelines for AI development and use across different types of technology and industrial sectors. The National Institute of Standards and Technology is being given the lead role in the development of technical standards for reliable, trustworthy, secure and interoperable AI systems.
The White House says an action plan will be developed “to preserve America’s advantage in collaboration with our international partners and allies.”
“In last week’s State of the Union address, President Trump committed to investing in cutting-edge industries of the future,” Michael Kratsios, deputy assistant to the president for technology policy, said in a prepared statement. “The American AI Initiative follows up on that promise with decisive action to ensure AI is developed and applied for the benefit of the American people.”
This week’s action comes amid rising concern about American competitiveness in artificial intelligence research and development.

China and the European Union are both pushing ahead with multibillion-dollar AI research and development programs. In response, the White House has formed an advisory panel on AI R&D, and a federal commission focusing on AI’s national security implications has been established with Amazon’s Andy Jassy and Microsoft’s Eric Horvitz among its members.
Amazon and Microsoft are among the hundreds of companies that are making AI a high priority in R&D, resulting in well-known products such as Amazon’s Alexa and Microsoft’s Cortana AI voice assistants (as well as similar AI agents offered by Apple and Google). AI capabilities such as machine learning and computer vision are also key to the development of autonomous vehicles and precision robotics.
Stacey Dixon, director of the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, or IARPA, said AI applications are also highly relevant to national security.
“Understanding imagery is one of the most evident opportunities for us to use AI, due to the sheer quantity of data to be analyzed and AI’s demonstrated effectiveness at image categorization,” she said. “However, IARPA also develops AI to address other intelligence challenges, including human language transcription and translation, facial recognition in real-world environments, sifting through videos to find nefarious activities, and increasing AI’s resilience to many kinds of attacks by adversaries.”
Those AI tools could be used for nefarious purposes as well, however. In a report issued last year, a consortium including the Electronic Freedom Foundation and OpenAI called on policymakers to collaborate closely with researchers to investigate, prevent and mitigate potentially malicious uses of AI.
This is an updated version of a report originally published at 9 p.m. PT March 10.

Artificial intelligence: friend or foe to employees?

To some degree, humans are quite predictable.
When faced with a change, our amygdala, the region of our brain that triggers a fight or flight response, will predictably influence human behavior. For example, when your company announces a change like consolidation or layoffs, people will react with either resistance, enthusiasm or worse, ambivalence.
Over the course of American history, we have faced many changes that were initially feared. When Henry Ford released the Model T car, fears from the loss of employment in the horse and buggy “industry” were palpable. Over time, however, enthusiasm replaced fear. Ford had created a new industry. Employees developed new skills. It also created new opportunities that benefited workers and business owners.
Today we’re faced with technological advancements that are transforming the way we communicate, create, and collaborate. One improvement that has finally matured enough to worry and excite us humans is artificial intelligence (AI).
The question is, will AI replace humans in the workplace? Indeed, dystopian fears have triggered the amygdala in many people. Those fears, however, are unfounded.
Technology versus humans

When early AI started to make noticeable impacts on workflows, companies anticipated laying off employees. Visions of saved labor costs made executives and investors happy. Imagine reducing costs like benefits, insurance, even office space.
Job loss, however, won’t be as rampant in America as initially feared. Job loss projections range from 9 percent to 47 percent. Why the wide range in forecasts? It depends on which side analysts and thought leaders fall concerning tech’s influence on the workforce.
A reliable way to determine the impact on your workforce is to evaluate the tasks employees do. Jobs, where tasks can be easily automated, have a higher likelihood of being eliminated, like clerical and production positions, for example.
On the flipside, artificial intelligence is less likely to overtake jobs that require higher education. Interestingly enough, some trade positions are expected to avoid the AI disruption.
A mutually beneficial relationship between technology and humans has a high propensity for success.
Adobe is already showing creatives how the relationship between technology and human can be harmonious. Adobe Sensei, the creative giant’s AI, delivers insights that flirt with being more human-like. For example, Sensei can filter through millions of images that meet your project’s needs. Want a photo that conveys happiness that’s not trite? Adobe’s AI can help find the right image that conveys the emotions you want.
Rather than referring to Sensei as AI, Chris Duffey, Adobe’s Strategic Development Manager for Creative Cloud, flips it to be IA—intelligent assistant. The switch humanizes technology in a way that is likely palatable for us humans. Sensei frees up humans from needless, long, laborious tasks. While Sensei does its thing, creatives can shift their focus to deep thinking or nuanced decisions making that defy algorithms.
Human versus human

In a 2018 McKinsey report, technical and social and emotional skills will become more critical over the next 11 years. Framed another way: It is no longer good enough for employees to be technically proficient. As leaders, we each need to understand the impact we have on others and results. Over the past two decades, we see this shift, a 50-percent increase in collaborative and agile team arrangements.
If people can’t work together with less friction, then companies face a severe conundrum: How to change already existing toxic or generic workplace cultures? The daunting reality is 70 percent of workers have negative work experiences. One contributing factor is a lack of quality relationships with coworkers.
It’s not AI that should worry us. Instead, it’s our impact on our colleagues. The quality of the human-to-human interaction has always been important. AI is merely revealing how teams that work well together become the next competitive advantage.
What’s next?
As AI and automation mature, leaders will further their understanding of this workplace change. We need to get better at integrating the benefits of automation into operational changes in the business. Our insatiable curiosity can be boundless. What’s more, there are no universal ethics surrounding AI and its usage. As an example, I recently shared an article about the role AI plays in the future of work. In response, one person warned about the loss of privacy. She has a legitimate concern.  However, AI is not the concern. It’s us.
At the same time, doomsday proclamations about humanity’s demise at the hands of our tech creations seems a bit dramatic. What AI cannot do is replicate the human ability to rely on our intuition, that gut instinct. It cannot think creatively either. This makes humans irreplaceable. Simply stated: companies need to become masters at uniting AI capabilities with human dynamics.

The demand-supply mismatch is driving up salaries.

Professionals with around 8-10 years of experience, with two-three years of that in AI, can easily get annual packages upwards of Rs 50 lakh, going up to Rs 1 crore and more while for those in senior strategic roles, salaries are up to Rs 2.5-3 crore.   “The entry salary of a CS engineer is Rs 3-3.5 lakh while that of an entry AI role is Rs 5.5-6 lakh,” said Anurag Malik, partner, people advisory services at EY India. “The majority of people with AI specialisation in India got into the area over the last two-three years.

The average AI experience of Indian professionals is just three years, with almost 67% of them having joined or transitioned into their current roles in the past two years. In contrast, around 57% organisations that are hiring for AI in India are looking for candidates with more than five years of experience. The highest demand is for professionals with skills in natural language processing and generation, image-based analytics, chatbots and machine learning. “Due to the limited talent pool, salaries are going up,” said Ratna Gupta, director of ABC Consultants.Prince Augustin, executive vice-president group human capital & leadership development at Mahindra & Mahindra, said the group has a large number of new hires in AI and other emerging technologies in various businesses. Since the field is very new and fast changing, it is difficult to find veterans in this space and hence there is a lot of demand, he said. From an India perspective, since a large part of AI clients are overseas, there seems to be even more willingness and ability from many companies to pay over the top, said Rakesh Barik, partner, Deloitte India. At many companies, it has been classified as a “hot skill”, which represents the highest band within the consulting skillsets.Barik estimates that there could not be more than a quarter of a million AI practitioners and engineers worldwide and the demand would have already surpassed more than a million. Adding to the problem is the low churn from India’s talent institutions and universities. “It is now a common practice of hiring a senior talent or a Ph.D to build a dream team underneath him or her. And these one-off hires are not coming in cheap and actually is more challenging,” he said.Recruiters say it is difficult to fill roles across levels because of the sheer number of options available to candidates. A hedge fund looking to hire an analyst with two years of AI experience for a machine learning-based trading model has had the position lying vacant for nearly 4-5 months even though it’s paying `40 lakh for a fairly junior role. Another ecommerce biggie, looking to staff an AI team under its chief data scientist, is struggling to find talent, said a recruiter.At the senior level, the problem is more pronounced. “There is a huge dearth of proven talent at a senior level with 10 years of AI experience. And everyone is competing for that. In most cases, one has to look abroad,” said Anuj Roy, managing partner, FIDIUS Advisory. “Jumps of even 100% while switching jobs are not uncommon. Even IT consulting companies are paying huge premiums for strategy people to come in and design roadmaps to implement AI in more processes,” said GC Jayaprakash, executive director at RGF Executive Search.( Originally published on Feb 11, 2019 )Read More News onArtificial Intelligence JobsdeloitteAI talentsMahindra Groupmachine learningABC Consultantsartificial intelligence",https://schema.org/,,WebPage,,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/hot-skill-artificial-intelligence-commands-huge-premium-in-job-market/articleshow/67948682.cms,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,‘Hot Skill’ Artificial Intelligence commands huge premium in job market,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-76939477,width-600,height-60,quality-100/economictimes.jpg', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}",,,,,,,"{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'cssSelector': ['.article_wrap h1', '.artSyn h2']}",,,,

Robots like this one from the BYU Robotics and Dynamics Lab are taking over the workplace. (Nate Edwards/BYU Photo)The artificial intelligence revolution is here.Technological advancements involving computers and robots are making big impacts on the workplace and don’t appear to be slowing down anytime soon.Between 400 million and 800 million jobs throughout the world are estimated to be replaced by AI by 2030, according to a study by the McKinsey Global Institute. The study states the jobs most likely to become automated in the U.S. include food preparation workers, production workers and travel workers.Utah has the 35th highest job automation potential among states in the U.S. at 45.6 percent, according to a report by the Brookings Institution. Over one million jobs in the state could be replaced by AI by the year 2030.The reactions to this revolution are mixed. Although there is a certain level of uncertainty when it comes to bringing AI into the workplace, BYU economics professor Michael Ransom said job automation can prove to be a positive thing for the economy.Technological advancements are expected to continue to make big impacts on the workplace.(Nate Edwards/BYU Photo)“When you get new technological changes it eliminates some jobs but it typically creates other ones,” Ransom said. “There’s always this question of, ‘Will the technological changes create or destroy more jobs?’ but really there’s always going to be something that people could do. They will just have to change what they’re doing.”Ransom mentioned that as new technological advancements such as robots have taken over production-based jobs, there has been a growth in service sector jobs such as health-care and recreation services. An increase in those who choose to go into the workplace right out of high school could be seen performing more relationship-based jobs rather than heading into the factories.BYU Economics Student Association President Kevin Standridge said he believes the reason why there is skepticism toward AI is because of how fast it can impact the workplace.“The reason artificial intelligence is scary for a lot of people from an economic perspective is that it has the potential to replace so many jobs at once,” Standridge said. “It puts a lot of people out of work.”Overall, however, Standridge sees automation as a good thing that might just take some time for people to get used to.Throughout history significant technological advancements have always influenced the workplace.(Mark Philbrick/BYU Photo 1981)History shows the introduction of new technology into society has often been met with skepticism and resistance. The printing press, typewriters and computers are examples of major technological advances that eventually proved critics wrong.“Throughout history you always have instances of creative destruction,” Standridge said. “When we first made typewriters it made printing a lot more efficient. When we got computers the same thing happened, we put all the typewriters out of business. Artificial intelligence is just the same step but for a lot of different industries.”Tesla, Waymo and Uber are just a few companies that are facing such opposition today. Although the idea of self-driving cars is scary to some, such technology could become commonplace in the future and could result in the job displacement of truck, bus and taxi drivers.“As time goes on and you start seeing things like self-driving cars, people will have to switch to more mind and engineering-based jobs rather than doing basic menial work,” said Alex Wright, a chemical engineering major from Draper. “Job automation does take some people out of business, but there are more effective and productive things that they could be doing instead.”Although the effects of AI in the workplace can cause some concern, Ransom believes being flexible and having a college education are crucial for success in the future.“The hallmark of a good education is that you can be flexible and learn how to do things,” Ransom said. “Having a strong, broad education is a good idea. The most educated people have done very well during the last couple of decades, so things look pretty good for college-educated students.”Standridge believes that the effects of job automation will push some to seek post-graduate degrees, but ultimately sees flexibility and problem-solving as the keys to success.“There is going to be a lot of pressure for post-graduate work, that is going to be a force,” Standridge said. “But that doesn’t mean that it’s going to be the only option. A lot of it is just going to be learning on the job and (knowing) how to solve certain problems. I don’t necessarily think post-graduate work is going to be a must.”TAGSArtificial IntelligenceJob AutomationtechnologyFacebook

Ann Johansson/Corbis via Getty ImagesSigal Samuel is a senior reporter for Vox’s Future Perfect and co-host of the Future Perfect podcast. She writes primarily about the future of consciousness, tracking advances in artificial intelligence and neuroscience and their staggering ethical implications. Before joining Vox, Sigal was the religion editor at the Atlantic.It was with a strangely deflated feeling in his gut that Harvard biologist Mohammed AlQuraishi made his way to Cancun for a scientific conference in December. Strange because a major advance had just been made in his field, something that might normally make him happy. Deflated because the advance hadn’t been made by him or by any of his fellow academic researchers. It had been made by a machine.DeepMind, an AI company that Google bought in 2014, had outperformed all the researchers who’d submitted entries to the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) conference, which is basically a fancy science contest for grown-ups.Every two years, researchers working on one of the biggest puzzles in biochemistry, known as the protein folding problem, try to prove how good their predictive powers are by submitting a prediction about the 3D shapes that certain proteins will take. That might seem like a weird thing to forecast, but it’s actually crucial for how scientists develop new drugs. DeepMind has a pretty clear explanation of how this works.By harnessing the power of machine learning, DeepMind won the CASP contest by a huge margin. What this advance represents for both biochemistry and machine learning is fascinating and important.But even more intriguing to me was a blog post AlQuraishi wrote in the aftermath of the conference, which I came across after it was highlighted in a New York Times article.In his post, AlQuraishi describes the gamut of emotions he experienced at CASP. He discusses his initial melancholy — he felt like he and the other academics had been made obsolete — and how he ultimately overrode that feeling “as my tribal reflexes gave way to a cooler and more rational assessment of the value of scientific progress.” His meditation struck me as important, because if we’re going to solve high-impact problems, we need to find a way to be psychologically open to the notion that our own minds will not always be the best tools.I spoke to AlQuraishi about how researchers can cope with the fact that AI is changing their scientific fields — and may even change our perception of science itself. A transcript of our conversation, lightly edited for length and clarity, follows.Sigal SamuelYou wrote a very personal blog post where you describe feeling a gamut of different emotions from the moment you headed to the conference to the moment you left. Can you walk me through those emotions?Mohammed AlQuraishiSo for people who are in the field, the results actually came out two days before the conference began. We could all go online and look. I was surprised because I wasn’t expecting [DeepMind] to do so well. I was also disappointed because I was participating [in the contest] too, and I didn’t do so well. There was that emotion, disappointment, because I had a personal stake in the matter.And then over the next couple days, it dawned on me that this is a field that people have been working in for decades. The fact that a new group could come in and do so well, so quickly — I felt bad because it demonstrated the structural inefficiency of academia. I felt really bad for the people who’ve been in this even longer than I have. So there was a feeling of solidarity with some of the other academic groups.It then became more a feeling of, okay, we should look at this from a different perspective: This is great, it’s going to bring attention to the [protein folding] issue.Sigal SamuelDo you think there was a psychological drive propelling your colleagues to want to undersell DeepMind’s contribution because it was displacing them?Mohammed AlQuraishiI think if it were one of the established academic groups [making the advance], people would’ve said, “It’s no surprise, we always knew this group would do well.” But the fact that it was coming from outside, with this machinery … that probably created some level of resentment, yes.But the DeepMind team was pretty open in sharing their insights, and from my perspective, the fact that there’s a new group in the field — it’s all for the better. The point is to compete to do better science, not to claim credit.Sigal SamuelAI advances can sometimes be overhyped and can yield emotion that isn’t merited by the actual situation — either too much optimism or too much pessimism. Do you think people walked away from the conference with realistic expectations for what AI can contribute to the field in the future?Mohammed AlQuraishiThe lay coverage was a little too optimistic, too overly enthusiastic. In the scientific community, it’s hard to say. I myself keep vacillating. Crystal-balling is a difficult thing.I place myself in the camp of being fairly bullish on machine learning. I do think that if you look at the history of science, it’s rare to see sustained improvement over a long period of time. I think what we’ve seen over the last, say, six years in machine learning is a fairly unique thing. It’s a once-in-a-generation type of thing, a genuine advance of the first order, comparable to the big intellectual revolutions.Sigal SamuelIt strikes me that there are established economies of prestige in academia. How do you think machine learning advances will change the prestige economy that we’re used to?Mohammed AlQuraishi[Laughs] That’s an interesting question. [Long pause] One version is to say, “This is going to make it such that being able to make sense of data will be more important, will increase in prestige.” I think that’s reasonable to expect. We’ve had this tendency as a field to be very obsessed with data collection. The papers that end up in the most prestigious venues tend to be the ones that collect very large data sets. There’s far less prestige associated with conceptual papers or papers that provide some new analytical insight.From my perspective, if there were a shift from the data collection exercise to the analysis exercise, I think that’d be a good thing in a way. In a lot of sciences, we’ve focused too much on data and not enough on understanding.Sigal SamuelThat’s reminiscent of the conversation I hear about AI among my fellow journalists. Just recently news reports came out about how AI is writing articles — one-third of the articles at Bloomberg are written with the help of AI. People always say, don’t worry, it’ll be a good thing because that’ll free up the journalists to do deeper thinking on more nuanced issues rather than focusing on the “who, what, where, when, why” — so there’s a funny parallel there.Mohammed AlQuraishiYeah, absolutely. And I actually think, looking further ahead, this will change our whole perception of what science is. Going away from human-conceived theories and models of natural phenomena to more data-driven methods and models.I think it’s a little silly to think we’re always going to be the smartest creatures on the planet. We’re going to be out-thought by machines eventually. In the interim, I suspect that what we’ll see in our modeling of natural phenomena is that it’ll increasingly be built by machines.What’s interesting is, when we cross this threshold (and in some ways, we already are), we’ll get to a point where the models we built are entirely incomprehensible to us. This will raise questions about, what is the nature of the scientific enterprise? What is it that we mean by “doing science”? Is science about understanding natural phenomena or about building mathematical models that’ll predict what will happen? Sigal SamuelThat’s so fascinating, that this could actually upend what we understand science to be.Given that kind of development, can we do a little thought experiment? Let’s say a smart undergraduate student with loads of potential comes to you tomorrow and says, “Hey, professor, I’m thinking of dedicating my career to researching protein structure prediction.” At this point, would you advise her against it? Would you tell her to leave the academy and go work for DeepMind?Mohammed AlQuraishi. CourtesyMohammed AlQuraishiI would encourage her to become fluent in machine learning and computing more broadly, because that’s going to be critical over the next few decades. It’s going to be one of the most important skill sets to have, irrespective of what phenomena you want to study. In terms of whether you stay in academia or go to DeepMind or elsewhere, I think that’ll probably be driven by the person’s motivation. If you’re really keen on solving a problem, then an industrial lab is the way to do it. If you’re more curiosity-oriented, if you want to tackle whatever topic draws your fancy at a given point in time, then perhaps academia is still the best place because you’re more independent.Sigal SamuelI think there’s also a class dimension at work here, right? Someone who’s highly trained, who has highly specialized knowledge, can potentially retrain or adapt the focus of their work so they’re not competing directly against AI. Do you think it’s easier for you than for, say, a factory worker to override the gut-level fear about being made obsolete? Mohammed AlQuraishiAbsolutely. Somebody who’s an academic who knows about machine learning today has pretty high job security. Somebody who’s doing certain other kinds of jobs, like truck-driving — I think if your job is less secure, absolutely it’s a completely different consideration.At one point, a lot of people thought there was a hierarchy among jobs — intellectual jobs would be the last to be replaced and mechanical jobs would be the first. But that’s actually unclear. It may well be that jobs that are mechanical will take a long time to replace because it’s actually hard to make robots that make certain gestures. And things in the higher echelons of intellect can maybe be more quickly replaced.Sigal SamuelIn these conversations about automation there’s always the worry about people losing their incomes, but there’s also a worry about the felt loss of meaning — the meaning we derive from the work that we do.Is that something you worry about — scientists feeling they derive less meaning from their work as machine learning makes more inroads in the field? Or is it not an issue to you because machine learning will just make the science advance faster and then we can all derive meaning from that?Mohammed AlQuraishiI think both things are true. A lot of scientists judge themselves based on how smart they are, how quickly they can solve a problem. So much social currency is based on that. And we compare ourselves to other people and we feel like imposters. So this could lead to a kind of widespread existential crisis.In the short term, I think this will be destructive. The profit motives will end up obsoleting a bunch of people. Maybe in the medium term, there’ll be some ways to adapt. We’ll think of ways to change society to define our value and identity in different ways. But I also suspect that in the very long run, there’ll be some form of augmentation or a cyborg scenario where machines and humans are integrated in some way.As we move into the longer time frame, we’re going to start to have to confront some of these broader questions. It behooves us, and particularly the machine learning community, to start communicating about the potential implications and thinking through ways we could smoothly transition to an era where machines are smarter than humans.I think it’s about equity and making sure we live in a place where we’re happy to live.Sign up for the Future Perfect newsletter.

Artificial Intelligence Comes to Emerson Media Art Gallery



An image created through artificial intelligence, part of Alexander Reben’s Creative Work as Adversary: The AI and Machine Art, on exhibit at Emerson Urban Arts: Media Art Gallery through April 13.
What happens when artificial intelligence and robotics meet art?
The latest exhibit at Emerson Urban Arts: Media Art Gallery, Creative Work as Adversary: The AI and Machine Art, examines the connections between the three through the work of MIT-trained roboticist and artist Alexander Reben.
“Reben’s work probes the inherently human nature of artificial intelligence and our inevitable co-development with artificial creations,” curator and Boston Cyberarts director George Fifield said.
The exhibit opens Thursday, February 14, and runs through Saturday, April 13.
Reben defines his work as “art as experiment,” using tools such as artificial philosophy, synthetic psychology, perceptual manipulation, and technological magic.
“Demanding Uninterestingness”
The exhibit includes oil paintings created when AI combines words to generate a new image, and prints made when the artist’s thoughts on specific phrases are interpreted by an art-generating algorithm.
Viewers will see AI “misfortunes,” or prints chosen by the artist that represent AI-learned philosophy created from fortune cookies, as well as videos, images of AI-generated handwriting, and a sculpture that speaks in AI-generated languages.
“This work helps us not only understand who we are, but also to consider who we will become,” artist Alexander Reben said. “I am thrilled to share these works with the Emerson community, Boston, and beyond.”
Reben’s artwork and research have been shown and published internationally, including The Vitra Design Museum and the MAK Museum Vienna, and he is a consultant for major companies guiding innovation for the social machine future.
He has built robots for NASA, and is a graduate of the MIT Media Lab, where he studied human-robot symbiosis and art. He has lectured at TED, SXSW, Google, University of California Berkeley, School of the Museum of Fine Arts Tufts, and MIT, among others. He is a 2016-2017 WIRED innovation fellow, a Stochastic Labs Resident, and a recent visiting scholar in the UC Berkeley Psychology Department.
The exhibit opens February 14 with a reception from 5:00-7:00 pm. Emerson Urban Arts: Media Art Gallery, 25 Avery Street, is free and open to the public Wednesday through Saturday, 2:00-7:00 pm. Reben will host a gallery walkthrough on Sunday, March 3, 4:00 pm.
A related public lecture, Human-Machine Collaboration in Art Making, takes place on Monday, March 4 at 5 p.m. in the Kresge Auditorium on the MIT campus.

With the invention of electronic digital computers in the early 1940s the pursuit of AI was made possible. The term itself was coined at a conference at Dartmouth in the summer of 1956, where scientists gathered to discuss ways to program computers to solve problems with the skills of a human. AI flourished for the next two decades and optimism was high that we would soon have machines with the general intelligence of an average human. Many of us will recall HAL 9000 from the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey. But the computers then were simply not powerful enough to store the amount of data required or process it as fast as needed so AI remained mostly hype. But by the end of the 20th century computing power and speed had advanced to the point where AI could be realized, marked by such demonstrations as IBM’s Deep Blue beating Gary Kasparov at chess. Now we live in the world of big data where we have the capacity to collect and process enormous amounts of data, enabling diverse realizations of artificial intelligence applications.  AI is used to personalize recommendations for videos, classify images to improve search engine performance, and provide wardrobe advice. It is also enabling driverless vehicles, detecting diseases, preserving wildlife, and assisting HR departments in hiring and firing.It is so pervasive that it is hard to distinguish real from artificial. Is that voice on the phone making the reservation, answering my customer service question, or providing healthcare advice, real or a Chatbot? Is that video of the president making a speech real or a Deepfake? It is getting harder to tell.But AI is here to stay and the lines will become even more blurred in the future. What will life be like with a digital workforce, where more and more jobs are replaced by machines and humans intermingle with robots in the workplace and the home? There is already the need in warehouses using large numbers of robots to have the human employees identify themselves as “I am not a robot” in order to avoid accidents. And  there are already jobs requiring humans to baby-sit for robots.Our relationship with smart machines also is becoming blurred. Today we don’t just fall in love through our phones.  The 2013 movie Her explored a relationship between man and computer where Joaquin Phoenix falls in love with his computer's highly advanced operating system. Recently a teacher in Japan married an anime hologram, giving new meaning to the term digital dating.AI is changing the way we live, work, and play. But how do we make sure that the technology is fair and ethical? Join us on February 12 for WorldCanvass: Artificial Intelligence, where a group of UI faculty and industry leaders in the fields of engineering, technology, education, medicine, and business will discuss the current impact of AI and what they see on the horizon. The program, which is free and open to the public, takes place at MERGE, 136 South Dubuque Street, Iowa City, from 5:30-7 p.m.  All are invited to a pre-show reception from 5-5:30 p.m. In addition, the University of Iowa Informatics Initiative has organized an all-day symposium on Artificial Intelligence on Friday, February 15, 2019 at the CPHB Atrium, 1st Floor. This event is free and open to the public.
