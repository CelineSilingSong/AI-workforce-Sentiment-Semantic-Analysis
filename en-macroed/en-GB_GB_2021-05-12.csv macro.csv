It might just be artificial intelligence.

Progress in AI music is accelerating rapidly, thanks to researchers and musicians at major tech conferences and universities who want to integrate widespread AI into the music world.

How Artificial Intelligence (AI) Is Helping Musicians Unlock Their CreativityAdobe Stock
Many artists feel we’re about to enter a “golden age” of creativity, powered by artificial intelligence, that can push music in new directions.

PROMOTED
Let’s look at some of the newest ways artificial intelligence is transforming the music industry from top to bottom.
Creating New Songs with the Help of AI
For 30 years, musician and composer David Cope has been working on Experiments in Musical Intelligence (EMI). EMI originally began in 1982 as an effort to help Cope overcome ""composer's block,"" and now his algorithms have produced a large number of original compositions in a variety of genres and styles.

Grammy-nominated producer Alex da Kid used IBM Watson to analyze five years’ of hit songs, as well as cultural data from films, social media, and online articles to figure out a theme for an AI-generated song that fans would enjoy. The final song, “Not Easy,” reached number four on the iTunes Hot Tracks chart within 48 hours after its release.

Composers Drew Silverstein, Sam Estes, and Michael Hobe were working on music for big-budget movies like The Dark Knight when they started getting requests for simple background music for television and video games. They worked together to create Amper, a consumer-friendly online tool that helps non-musicians and online content creators make royalty-free music – using their own parameters – in a few seconds.
Creating Virtual Pop Stars
One thing is clear: Since the start of the pandemic, fans miss going to concerts.
To fill the void, Authentic Artists has introduced a large collection of AI-powered virtual artists who can deliver new music experiences.
Authentic Artists’ animated virtual musicians generate all-original compositions to play on screen, and also respond to audience feedback by increasing or decreasing the tempo or intensity, or even fast-forwarding to the next song in the set.
Finding the Next Big Artists
Audio-on-demand streaming like Spotify totaled $534 billion in the United States alone, according to Buzz Angle Music’s 2018 report.
So how do promising new artists get discovered, with all that competition?
Artificial intelligence helps the music industry with A&R (artist and repertoire) discovery by combing through music and trying to identify the next breakout star.
Warner Music Group acquired a tech start-up last year that uses an algorithm to review social, streaming, and touring data to find promising talent. In 2018, Apple also acquired Asaii, a start-up that specializes in music analytics, to help them boost their A&R.
AI Complementing Creativity
AI technology is transforming the music industry in a myriad of ways, but creatives shouldn’t be worried about losing their jobs and being replaced by computers. We’re still a long way from artificial intelligence being able to create hit songs on their own.
But as tools develop and the music industry learns how to use AI as a supplement to human creativity, our world will continue to sound sweeter and sweeter every year.

Case Western Reserve University scientists show that artificial intelligence tools can work effectively for different locations, populations
For artificial intelligence (AI) to realize its full potential to benefit cancer patients, researchers will have to prove that their machine-learning successes can be consistently reproduced across settings and patient populations.
That’s why Case Western Reserve biomedical engineering researchers are increasingly focused on applying their novel algorithms to patient scans from multiple locations.
Earlier this spring, for example, they published promising findings involving lung cancer diagnosis among 400 patients from three health care systems. And a 2020 study showed that their approach could predict recurrence in 610 early-stage lung cancer patients across four sites.
Anant Madabhushi
“This is no small thing—this is an important next step in making AI useable for clinicians someday, and it’s one of things we have to address head on,” explained Anant Madabhushi, director of the university’s Center for Computational Imaging and Personalized Diagnostics (CCIPD) said. “For instance, we know that even within a single hospital, one could have patients scanned on different CT scanners, resulting in images with differing appearance, so the AI has to be able to account for these differences.”
So if AI is ever going to be trusted—and then routinely used—by physicians and clinicians, Madabhushi said, those end users must be convinced not only that computer diagnosis is possible, but that it can be reproduced—and specifically work for their own patients.
The difference: ‘stable’ featuresTo this point, Anant Madabhushi and his group at the university’s Center for Computational Imaging and Personalized Diagnostics (CCIPD) have successfully applied their AI determining which lung cancer patients would respond well to chemotherapy, immunotherapy or, in some cases, whether cancer would return or how long a patient might live.But in each case, those outcomes have only come from analysis of existing data and/or images after the fact and only for a single group of cancer patients.Now, instead of just teaching their computers to focus on features in the scans that differentiate between malignant and benign tumors, for example, they programmed the AI to also remember lesser features which are consistent from one scan to another—even if those features were unrelated to the cancer itself.Key to this work was the evaluation of hundreds of image features by biomedical engineering PhD student Mohammadhadi Khorrami, Madabhushi said.Khorrami considered not only how texture and shape of lung nodules could lead to a diagnosis of lung cancer and predict outcomes, but also how consistent, or stable, these features were across CT scanners and sites.“To do this, we identified a set of features that were most accurate—but at the same time stable across sites,” Khorrami said. “So, when we evaluated the machine learning models with these accurate and stable features on external sites, these models did better when compared to ones created with only the most accurate features, the ones where the stability of features was not considered.”
Next steps: re-proving reproducible results
Researchers call this reproducibility or often “generalizability,” the idea that a successful method, treatment or tool can work no matter when, where, or on whom—or in the face of virtually any other variable.
It has proven an elusive goal and has even called a “myth” by other researchers, who have identified several daunting hurdles. Those difficulties include differences in how CT machines produce images, variations in hardware and software and patient demographics.
To that end, Madabhushi and his group are planning prospective clinical trials using the generalized AI signatures for lung cancer on CT scans that they have already identified.
The researchers have been working with hospitals in Northeast Ohio to assess the real-world generalizability of these AI tools for problems relating to diagnosis and prognosis of lung cancers.
Now, new published research builds on previous and ongoing work within CCIPD over the last few years in the area of developing generalizable AI models.
What’s new is the creation of a more formal framework for identifying stable and accurate features, while also validating the approach on much larger numbers of studies and institutions. 
The research by Madabhushi, biomedical engineering PhD student Mohammadhadi Khorrami and collaborators appeared, respectively, in April 2020 in the journal Lung Cancer, and in March 2021 in the European Journal of Cancer.
Others on the European Journal paper from Case Western Reserve included Kaustav Bera, from the Department of Biomedical Engineering, and Pingfu Fu, from the Department of Population and Quantitative Health Sciences at the School of Medicine.
Among more than a half-dozen other contributors was longtime Madabhushi collaborator Vamsidhar Velcheti, director of thoracic oncology at NYU Langone’s Perlmutter Cancer Center, who previously worked in Cleveland.

The Takeaway
An AI neural network built to predict protein and RNA sequence interactions cannot explain what patterns it sees. CSHL Assistant Professor Peter Koo found a way to “quiz” the network with a carefully designed set of synthetic RNA sequences to find out what it learned. The answer was a little surprising.


Artificial intelligence (AI) learning machines can be trained to solve problems and puzzles on their own instead of using rules that we made for them. But often, researchers do not know what rules the machines make for themselves. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) Assistant Professor Peter Koo developed a new method that quizzes a machine-learning program to figure out what rules it learned on its own and if they are the right ones.  
Computer scientists “train” an AI machine to make predictions by presenting it with a set of data. The machine extracts a series of rules and operations—a model—based on information it encountered during its training. Koo says:
“If you learn general rules about the math instead of memorizing the equations, you know how to solve those equations. So rather than just memorizing those equations, we hope that these models are learning to solve it and now we can give it any equation and it will solve it.”
Koo developed a type of AI called a deep neural network (DNN) to look for patterns in RNA strands that increase the ability of a protein to bind to them. Koo trained his DNN, called Residual Bind (RB), with thousands of RNA sequences matched to protein binding scores, and RB became good at predicting scores for new RNA sequences. But Koo did not know whether the machine was focusing on a short sequence of RNA letters—a motif—that humans might expect, or some other secondary characteristic of the RNA strands that they might not. 
Koo and his team developed a new method, called Global Importance Analysis, to test what rules RB generated to make its predictions. He presented the trained network with a carefully designed set of synthetic RNA sequences containing different combinations of motifs and features that the scientists thought might influence RB’s assessments.  
They discovered the network considered more than just the spelling of a short motif. It factored in how the RNA strand might fold over and bind to itself, how close one motif is to another, and other features. 
Koo hopes to test some key results in a laboratory. But rather than test every prediction in that lab, Koo’s new method acts like a virtual lab. Researchers can design and test millions of different variables computationally, far more than humans could test in a real-world lab. 
“Biology is super anecdotal. You can find a sequence, you can find a pattern but you don’t know ‘Is that pattern really important?’ You have to do these interventional experiments. In this case, all my experiments are all done by just asking the neural network.”
The team published their new methods and tools in PLOS Computational Biology. Their tools are now available to everyone online.

In 2016, ProPublica reported that an artificial intelligence tool used in courtrooms across the United States to predict future crimes, the Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS), was biased against Black defendants. 
COMPAS takes into account factors such as previous arrests, age, and employment. Its output — risk scores for recidivism — are one of the factors judges use to determine whether defendants will face jail or prison time. Using COMPAS, Black defendants were incorrectly labeled as “high-risk” to commit a future crime twice as often as their white counterparts. Northpointe, the parent company of COMPAS, refuted ProPublica’s claims, stating that the algorithm was working as intended.
Northpointe argued that Black people have a higher baseline risk of committing future crimes after an arrest — and this results in higher risk scores for Black people as a group. Northpointe, now rebranded as Equivant, hasn’t publicly changed the way it computes risk assessments. 
To call risk assessment algorithms objective is to ignore the social systems and structures in which they are created
Computer science researchers have tried to fix racist algorithms by imposing a set of criteria they’ve dubbed “fairness.” Research on fairness — the mathematical criteria that researchers place on algorithms to ensure that outcomes aren’t based on race — has grown, with Amazon alone putting 20 million dollars into it last year. But a coherent picture of fairness in the field remains frustratingly elusive. 
The answer may lie in simply changing how we define “fairness.”
Experts in algorithmic fairness worry the current approaches to defining fairness will never result in actual fair outcomes for Black people. They warn that a purely mathematical solution focused on “accuracy” is a myopic approach to deciding what is fair. Accuracy, in the context of fairness, is a measure of how correct an algorithm’s predictions are. But an algorithm used to predict a future crime will only reinforce the logic of the carceral system, where some people are always more likely to be deemed high-risk because of how law enforcement treats race. Solving this problem means considering the outcomes of the use of an algorithm, the impact of oppression, and tackling the inherent unfairness in society at its root. 
The use of algorithms in social spaces, particularly in the prison system, is an inherently political problem, not a technological one
“[The] discourse has largely been motivated by a concern that there’s no convergence on a single notion of what would make an algorithmic system fair,” says Lily Hu, a PhD candidate in applied mathematics at Harvard University who studies algorithmic fairness. Hu argues that the reason for this is because the use of algorithms in social spaces, particularly in the prison system, is an inherently political problem, not a technological one. “There are societal problems where technological solutions are great,” Hu says, “like indoor plumbing.”
“But many of the problems we’re trying to solve,” Hu continues, “aren’t problems of that kind.” 
The use of artificial intelligence algorithms in predictive policing and risk assessments is only growing despite continuous reporting that these tools often perpetuate harsher sentencing of Black defendants and harsher policing of Black communities. Risk assessments, like COMPAS, are commonly used in pretrial detention. They’re often marketed as methods to aid in criminal justice reform across jurisdictions in the United States. They are used in 46 states in the US. 
Because of their many problems, many criminal justice experts caution against the use of risk assessments in criminal justice reform. Yet to proponents, the appeal of artificial intelligence algorithms in place of a human decision-maker in assessments is clear: they allow law-makers, justices, and police officers to shift responsibility onto a seemingly more objective actor. Proponents argue that algorithms are a way of overcoming the social biases of human decision-makers, citing their increased “accuracy” (compared to humans) as an asset. They continue to be adopted in jurisdictions across the US.

To call risk assessment algorithms objective is to ignore the social systems and structures in which they are created. It is clear now that artificial intelligence algorithms can carry the biases of their mostly-white programmers. They base predictions on data, which can be incomplete or carry socially-ingrained stereotypes and prejudices. Both sources of bias can lead to bad predictions that hurt people of color. Recent, high profile examples include Facebook face-recognition algorithms mislabeling photos of Black people as gorillas, or mistakenly labeling Asian people as blinking in photos. 
In the previous cases (and within the context of social media), the solution might be to build fairer, more “accurate” algorithms, trained on more representative data. In the case of criminal justice, experts argue that even perfect algorithms — those with 100 percent accuracy — will still perpetuate systemic bias and end up hurting people of color. Inaccurate predictions lead to bias, but accurate ones reinforce existing bias.
“The underlying problem here is that we have racialized hierarchies of what crime means and who is at ‘risk’ of committing those crimes (not to mention who is at risk of being caught for those crimes), combined with a policy that punishes those at high risk with the loss of liberty,” writes Ben Green, a Professor at the University of Michigan who studies algorithmic fairness, in an email to Massive. “Even if risk assessments could attain some type of perfect prediction, that wouldn’t solve the problem. A perfect risk assessment could have the perverse effect of making this policy appear more legitimate and making those who are detained as a result appear to be more truly deserving of that punishment.”
For true “fairness” — true equality for marginalized people — the prison system must abandon the use of algorithms in risk assessments altogether.

Much of the tension (including the ProPublica-Northpointe debate) around fairness circles around the inherent incompatibility around two major mathematical definitions of fairness.  One, called calibration, supposes that what an algorithm predicts to be the actual underlying risk that someone will reoffend (50% chance of reoffending means 50% chance of rearrest, regardless of the offender’s race). Another is that the number of errors be equal for both groups. Both definitions can’t be satisfied at once. This (statistically proven) incompatibility has been dubbed the “impossibility of fairness” and has led some researchers to conclude that implementing algorithms requires inherent, unavoidable trade-offs. Others have argued that calibration is sufficient and algorithms like COMPAS, which meet the calibration criteria, are fair.
Hu argues that the impossibility of fairness is just illustrating the political and ethical nature of the problem. “The impossibility of fairness just shows in mathematical terms that we can’t have it all,” she says.
According to Green, the problem is that two common notions of fairness don’t properly tackle the unfairness imposed by social inequality. Algorithms meant to ensure that offenders remain imprisoned fail to account for the systemic reasons why more Black people may end up in jail and reoffend. Such narrow definitions aren’t promoting just outcomes — they’re perpetuating broken definitions of what justice is. 
“The fundamental problem here is not actually that there are different definitions of fairness that could be used. The problem is that our focus is incredibly narrow, considering only a single decision point. If we think about the two major fairness notions, neither really get to the heart of the matter of social hierarchy and institutionalized inequality. We need to take a broader view of the matter — and by doing so we can also realize that the impossibility of fairness doesn’t provide as intractable of a dilemma as is typically assumed,” writes Green.
According to Green, it isn’t clear that we should assume that we want algorithms to work to increase the number of offenders in jail or prison. Incarceration is in itself harmful, and has long-term negative impacts. We can think about mathematical fairness all we want, but instead, we should just abolish jails and prisons.

Interesting article! It’s also important to note that these algorithms are trained using a stand-in measure of the actual outcome - so “likelihood of being convicted of a crime” is often treated as an accurate measure of “likelihood of committing a crime” by the people developing the algorithm. I think this is mentioned in the article but it’s one of the key reasons these kind of algorithms will always be racist - they are being trained with the goal of accurately predicting the decisions of an inherently racist system.

Great article, Natalia! I think the quote from Ben Green really nails the heart of this issue: even if we could somehow make a perfectly “fair” risk assessment, it would still be created on the basis of a criminal justice system that has a built-in racialized hierarchy, and, as he says, “…a perfect risk assessment could have the perverse effect of making this policy appear more legitimate and making those who are detained as a result appear to be more truly deserving of that punishment.”

However, I’m not convinced that this argument necessitates the statement that “for true “fairness” — true equality for marginalized people — the prison system must abandon the use of algorithms in risk assessments altogether.” While we certainly can’t assume that algorithms are the perfect solution, the fact is that all risk assessments, whether done by machines or by humans, are based in a biased system. What we need is transparency in risk assessment, something that human-generated risk assessments largely do not offer. So using an algorithm (although, obviously, a much improved one) might actually provide an opportunity to increase that level of transparency in the future. Clearly the algorithms currently being used are hugely flawed and must be overhauled, but I don’t think that this means that algorithmic risk assessment in general could not ever function in a way that provides meaningful transparency and equality.

 Hi Elizabeth! Thank you! And thanks for taking the time to read the piece and comment. I agree that Ben’s quote really nailed down the issue, I would check out his recent academic papers if you’re interested! I see where you’re coming from, but I stand by my statement. Generally, I’m not a person that thinks algorithmic technologies shouldn’t be used–– I’m in favor of algorithmic technologies that improve reduce harm and promote positive interventions (see: DataSF | Keeping Moms and Babies in Nutrition Program). 
In the piece, I challenge the idea that we need risk assessments in the prison system (especially pre-trial, where I would advocate just releasing people), or even the prison system at all. I think we need to be careful and selective about how we use algorithmic technologies. I know I don’t go into this a lot in the piece, but my logic is that the prison system itself is harmful and that the way to tackle this is to abolish it (and I know this is a pretty radical position, but it’s the framework I use to think about how to use algorithmic technologies. 
A question I ask is: how does this technology reduce or perpetuate harm?). In a biased system, algorithms used to punish people will always be biased, and that’s essentially what I wanted to say in this piece. The call for more transparency is important but doesn’t get to the heart of the issue, which is the fact that risk assessments in the way they are currently part of the carceral system and no amount of improvements to them are going to fix structural inequality. Really complicated issue and I could talk about it all day so I’ll just stop here. Really great comment!

This article tackles a significant problem I’ve always had with AI. Although many people assume it avoids the problem of human judgement and bias, that just isn’t true. It is a machine/robot/technological thing instead of a person, but a person programmed it. As long as humans are behind the programming, this will continue to be a problem. Until people can look beyond race and judge fairly themselves, AI won’t be able to either.

Even though AI continues to thrive and grow, there remain challenges to use the technology. Just some include finding data scientists, determining the right problems to focus on, getting quality data and scaling the models.


No doubt, these problems are even worse for non-tech companies. They generally do not have the expertise or sufficient resources to make AI a success.

“Research shows non-tech companies in particular have struggled to take their AI programs beyond the proof of concept and pilot phases–with just 21% of retail, 17% of automotive, 6% of manufacturing, and 3% of energy companies successfully scaling their AI use cases,” said Jerry Kurtz, who is the Executive Vice President of Insights and Data at Capgemini North America.

But despite all this, there are still a myriad of companies that are beating the odds. And they are becoming much more competitive. “There are many opportunities for non-tech companies to leverage AI to improve efficiency and provide a better customer and employee experience,” said Margaret Lee, who is the Senior Vice President and General Manager of Digital Service Operations Management at BMC.

PROMOTED
So what are some of the non-tech companies that have been able to move-the-needle with their AI efforts? Here’s a look at two and the lessons learned.
John Deere: Keep in mind that the company has a long history of innovation, going back to the invention of the steel plow in 1837. The result is that John Deere is a world leader, with a market capitalization of $120 billion and annual sales of over $35 billion.   
The company’s AI efforts began with machine vision because of its advantages with GPS connectivity in its equipment and rich datasets. For example, during the spring, the peak data ingestion was 425MB per second or about 50 million sensor measurements per second.

“Our projects have resulted in products in the market, or soon to be in the market, that reduce chemical inputs but sensing weeds from non-weeds and selectively apply chemical to the weeds only,” said Jahmy Hindman, who is the Chief Technology Officer of John Deere. “In addition, this work has led to vision-based automated control systems in combine harvesters that optimize the processing settings of the ‘factories on wheels’ to minimize the grain lost during harvest.”

Levi Strauss: An early project for this company came in response to the Covid-19 lockdowns in Europe. Levi Stratus looked for ways to manage the inventory pile-up. To this end, the company gathered unique datasets on dynamic price elasticities and then applied AI to it. 
It was a small project but was able to scale quickly. What started as a test in 11 stores in Germany in May 2020 grew to 17 countries in Europe by October.  The system was also used for the 11/11 Singles’ Day in China. 
“I have three pieces of advice from this experience,” said Louis DiCesari, who is the Global Head of Data, analytics, and AI at Levi Strauss. “First, choose real, commercial problems that are aligned to your company’s strategic priorities, and chunk them into actionable steps. Second, don’t get too hung up on having perfect data or technology, or using the latest algorithms. Instead, embrace agile, deliver minimum viable products, continuously measure the impact, and continue to iterate and add new features. And, of course, set a vision, communicate the progress toward that vision throughout the organization, and invite feedback.”
DiCesari attributes AI to the company’s ability to accelerate innovation and move faster than ever before. “In 2021, we aim to deliver more value and support all countries and functions of the enterprise, infuse data and AI throughout the business, enable new ways of working and continue streamlining processes, while also digitizing assets,” he said.

As the pandemic further accelerates our digital transformation, companies are relying even more on automation and particularly on artificial intelligence. Two-thirds of CEOs surveyed last year by a major consulting firm said they will use AI even more than before for the creation of new workforce models. Even higher numbers plan to digitize operations, customer interactions, business models, and revenue streams. This huge acceleration and shift will surely bring massive failures, leaving companies — and in some cases even critical infrastructure — vulnerable to loss as critical decision-making is handed off to AI.
As a technologist who has built platforms and worked in the major industries that employ AI often (such as FinTech and health care), I have seen first-hand what goes wrong when some of the world’s biggest companies leave their intelligence to their AI. Based on the hype around AI, it would appear that everything can be improved by sophisticated algorithms sifting through masses of data. From streamlining customer care to inventing new perfumes, and even coaching soccer teams, AI looks like an unstoppable purveyor of competitive advantage, and practically all that company executives have to do is let it loose and go have lunch (cooked by an AI Robot Chef) while they watch their company’s profits climb.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



Sadly, what we see in execution is a different world altogether — from mismanaged expectations to extremely expensive failures and mistakes. All too often AI is not the shining light to a bright company future but rather the blind leading the blind down the wrong path, until someone falls off a cliff. Many of those most responsible for hype in the world of artificial intelligence have never written a line of code, let alone deployed AI in production. Even few developers have the incentive to give you a dose of reality. I am happy to share some of the practical failures of AI, based on my own experience, and provide some insight into what decision makers need to be aware of.
Here are some of the worst ways to use AI, as demonstrated by hedge funds, Wall Street investment banks and companies from Fortune 100 enterprises down to startups:
1. Making decisions based on the wrong data
AI is great at finding patterns in huge datasets and is efficient at predicting outcomes based on those patterns and finding uncorrelated alpha (hidden patterns in the dataset). But big problems arise when the wrong data (or outlier information) gets pulled into the dataset. In one famous example in the late 2000s there was a military coup in Thailand, and the algorithm behind a major fund interpreted that military coup as a market event, shorting a lot of Asian equities, quickly losing nine figures in dollar value.
I worked with a small hedge fund focused on the TMT sector (technology, media, telecommunications). The founders came from a large financial firm and brought with them some programmers who had worked on trading systems for REITS and the energy sector. Their goal was to build an analytics engine that the traders in this new TMT-focused hedge fund could use for signaling certain key events. The problem was that their developers had copied and merged two engines that were built for REITS and energy trading and tried to fit technical indicators more relevant to the TMT sector into this hybrid. I was called in to do forensics after it was built because the engine was giving sporadic and inconsistent results, and it took us some time to realize that, although the founders thought their team had built a brand new engine designed specifically for TMT, it was really built from spare parts. Although all three sectors share similar technical indicators, like implied volatility, or 52-week moving average, AI is sensitive and detailed work and each engine should be customized.
Make sure your AI is making recommendations based on relevant data.
2. Failing to train your AI properly
You can feed your AI engine all the right data and have it spit back the right answers, but until it gets tested in the wild you don’t know what it will do. Rushing to give it more responsibility than it is ready for is like sending a small child out into the real world — neither one is going to bring good results.advertisement
A hedge fund client was interested in AI for quant trading. They had hired an external team to build a proof-of-concept model of an AI engine, and my team later provided consulting services on that POC. To build a good AI engine to generate alpha (meaning, to increase the measure of ROI on investment), you would need to have a large dataset of historical data that is homogeneous. In finance, datasets are structured in a time series format, offering data points with widely different levels of granularity. Generally, the more data points we have in a dataset, the better the engine will be at detecting future results; those data points will help a well-designed engine discover non-linear correlation of data to help in predictions. We advised the client to give the AI engine more time to process their dataset to make it more homogeneous and to not follow mainstream pricing signals. Sadly, they didn’t, and the POC was overfitting and so finely tuned to the specific dataset that it didn’t work with new, unseen data. In other words, it was useless with live market data.
Give your AI time to process and learn new information.
3. Ignoring the human responsibility for decisions
No matter what you program your AI to do, it will not share your human goals or bear their consequences. Thus we’ve seen early examples of AI leading early GPS users into a river, or deleting critical information to “minimize” differences in a dataset.advertisement
I’ve seen more than one startup built on the assumption that AI algorithms can learn credit approval models and replace the credit approval officer in granting/denying credit loans. However, when you are denied a credit loan, federal law requires a lender to tell you why they made that decision. Software doesn’t really make decisions (it just identifies patterns) and isn’t responsible for decisions; humans are. Since federal law agrees that humans are responsible for credit decisions, many of these startups burned through venture capital funds and then could not legally launch to customers because the AI they developed was inherently biased. When it denied loans, no human could adequately explain why the denial occurred.
Make sure to keep people responsible for human consequences.
4. Overvaluing data
Some data simply can’t be used to build anything useful. One of our clients that failed at using AI was a popular medical diagnosis platform with its own data lake and a broad array of datasets. The company that owned it had acquired another platform with its own array of siloed datasets. The executives wanted to glean some insight into the jumble of disconnected datasets and needed help with onboarding potential customers. The problem was that these datasets were describing different medical issues/profiles, and trying to find common denominators of any real value was not possible. Despite all the compiled information, working with this client’s data was like having lego pieces that didn’t actually connect. Just because they are alike in many respects does not mean that you can build a castle out of them. After consulting with the client, we recommended they not do the project.
A real estate developer wanted us to design AI for build-decision insights, the notion being that if we could ingest enough data from real estate listings, we could perform analytics that would inform their decisions about the layout of their new developments. The client hoped the AI insights would tell them what would be the most optimal layout, based on the location of the building. For example, should the building have one large apartment per floor, or divide the floor into three one-bedroom apartments? Should it be a mixed-use building with commercial stores at the bottom and residential rentals? After we ingested real-estate listings data from different states, worked on dataset analysis, and interacted with subject matter experts, it became obvious that because the real estate market is highly localized, a one-size-fits-all algorithm would not work. The real estate of Midtown Manhattan East is slightly different from Midtown West, and Brooklyn is different from Queens, let alone New York state as an entire dataset. The many datasets were too small independently to build a meaningful classification algorithm, and the project didn’t go through.
In these cases, the companies cut their losses, but many others just keep throwing money at AI, digging deeper into details that never connect to their goals.
Before building an AI engine, make sure you have the right parts.
Where do we go from here?
AI may be the future of this accelerated digital business world, but for now too much of it is still a world of hype. Enterprises should consider AI, but with a grounded view and proper understanding of what it really does. And they should develop a proper perspective for any related initiatives. Decision makers need to understand the reality of AI, the potential it brings, and challenges behind it. Have a clear strategy of any potential AI project, taking into account the data available, timelines, costs, and expectations. Usually, successful AI projects provide long-term results rather than immediate benefits.
AI, at its core, is simply inference; it can help analyze tremendous detail, but only humans can understand the big picture.  We understand that as humans our decisions have consequences (business, legal, ethical), and giving AI false human traits covers up the fact that it does not think like we do. Humans may make more “mistakes” than AI, but we also have more power to recognize them. So, consider “artificial intelligence,” but when you’re thinking about how to deploy it, make sure that your own intelligence is still leading the way.

Hofstadter’s book Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid was published. It became a very popular and influential work.Hofstadter’s main subjects in that book (at least as I read it) are Kurt Gödel’s incompleteness theorems, self-reference and “strange loops”. He also tied these subjects to artificial intelligence (AI) and the nature of computers.Just to get one thing straight out of the way to begin with.Neither this piece nor Hofstadter’s book have much — or indeed anything — to do with the debate about IQ (i.e., intelligence quotient) and how it’s related to human groups and individuals. (This has become such a politicised issue — on all sides — that it’s hardly worth contributing to.)Predictably, the question “What is intelligence?” is raised (if often obliquely) in Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid. Thus Hofstadter offered his readers eight “essential abilities for intelligence”. So what immediately follows are some biographical details and quotes from Hofstadter which may help put this piece in some kind of perspective.Hofstadter once said that “a large fraction [of his audience] seems to be those who are fascinated by technology”. Indeed his work “has inspired many students to begin careers in computing and artificial intelligence”. Yet Hofstadter himself has also (rhetorically?) said that he has “no interest in computers”.Hofstadter has also advanced various sceptical positions on AI. For example, when Garry Kasparov was defeated by Deep Blue, Hofstadter wrote:“It was a watershed event, but it doesn’t have to do with computers becoming intelligent.”Yet despite all that, Hofstadter did once write (in his collection of articles Metamagical Themas) that“in this day and age, how can anyone fascinated by creativity and beauty fail to see in computers the ultimate tool for exploring their essence?”Indeed Hofstadter went so far as to organise a symposium (at Stanford University and in April 2000) called ‘Spiritual Robots’.Big Data JobsEight Essential Abilities for Intelligence?The following piece is not a set of arguments which attempts to state that computers are identical to humans when it comes to all aspects of intelligence. Instead, it’s simply an attempt to challenge what are seen — by many — to be absolute and (as it were) eternal differences between computers and human beings when it comes to intelligence.It’s worth saying here that some of my responses to each of Hofstadter’s eight “essential abilities for intelligence” may get a little repetitive. That’s mainly because what can be said about one such ability — in relation to artificial intelligence or computers — can be said about (some of) the others too.In any case, much depends on how one takes these abilities. And, as we shall see, it certainly depends on how the words (or concepts) contained in the sentences which express them are interpreted.It’s also worth noting that Hofstadter’s eight essential abilities for intelligence have been extensively quoted over the years (though little discussed) in the literature on AI and other related matters. (See the pages of quotes — on Google Search — here.)The following is the relevant extract from Hofstadter’s book (to which I’ve added numbers):“No one knows where the borderline between non-intelligent behavior and intelligent behavior lies, in fact, to suggest that a sharp border exists is probably silly. But essential abilities for intelligence are certainly:(1) to respond to situations very flexibly;(2) to take advantage of fortuitous circumstances;(3) to make sense out of ambiguous or contradictory messages;(4) to recognise the relative importance of different elements of a situation;(5) to find similarities between situations despite differences which may separate them;(6) to draw distinctions between situations despite similarities which may link them;(7) to synthesize new concepts by taking old concepts and putting them together in new ways;(8) to come up with ideas which are novel.”It can be seen in the above that Hofstadter uses the words “intelligent behavior”, not the more abstract and general word “intelligence”. This suggests that he believed that if any x is capable of behaving — or acting — intelligently, then it is intelligent. Thus this position works against the idea that intelligence is some kind of entity in the mind or brain that effectively works as a kind of all-purpose and private mental “organ”. Behaviourists (from Gilbert Ryle and before) have, of course, argued against this conception of intelligence — and for many good reasons.I shall now tackle each essential ability for intelligence one by one.Trending AI Articles:1. Why Corporate AI projects fail?2. How AI Will Power the Next Wave of Healthcare Innovation?3. Machine Learning by Using Regression Model4. Top Data Science Platforms in 2021 Other than Kaggle(1) To respond to situations very flexiblyThe problem here is that not all adult human beings “respond to situations very flexibly”. Some human beings are very inflexible and they are so in many different ways. So reacting very flexibly can’t be entirely definitive of what it is to be a human being. Of course many humans do respond to situations very flexibly — yet the point still stands.And neither can it be said that all computers (or all computer programmes) don’t respond very flexibly. In many contexts, they do. Think of an Internet search in which your wording (either for a question or for something else) is very ungrammatical or includes misspellings. Despite all that, the search picks up on these things and still provides a good answer. Of course sceptics may question this and say that it’s not a good example of responding to a situation very flexibly. But why isn’t it a good example — at least within this limited context? That said, one can also cite the well-known case of computerised robots and their not being able to navigate very well around new environments (but see here). But this is also true of some adult human beings and all young children. (Incidentally, many other animal species are better navigators than most humans.)Of course all this will partly depend on what “very flexibly” means because, as with all Hofstadter’s examples, this phrase is — to some extent at least — vague. Indeed Hofstadter probably wouldn’t have denied this problem of vagueness when it comes to these abilities for intelligence.(2) To take advantage of fortuitous circumstancesThis is even vaguer — or simply broader — than (1) above.The obvious thing which will be argued here is that computers won’t know anything about specific “fortuitous circumstances”… unless they’ve been programmed to know about them. Of course if they’ve been programmed to know about specific fortuitous circumstances, then they won’t actually be fortuitous circumstances to that computer. The problem here is that human beings also need to be programmed (or educated) enough in order to take advantage of fortuitous circumstances. And, as with all the other abilities cited by Hofstadter, some human beings are not very good at taking advantage of fortuitous circumstances. Still, compared to most computers (or computerised robots) and in most situations, humans are good at this.Yet all that hints at a central problem.This particular distinction between humans and computers isn’t absolute. Indeed there’s no categorical reason why computers can’t be programmed to take advantage of fortuitous circumstances.Again, this is not an argument which states that computers are identical to humans when it comes to all aspects of intelligence. Instead, it’s simply to challenge what are seen — by many — to be absolute and eternal differences.(3) To make sense out of ambiguous or contradictory messagesSome human beings are often not very good at making sense out of ambiguous or contradictory messages. Indeed some adult humans are no good at this in any circumstances. Of course many other human beings are good at this. Yet because not all human beings are good at this, then this can’t be seen as a clear cut and definitive dividing line between human beings and computers. In other words, in order to make clear cut and definitive distinctions between human beings and computers one mustn’t rely on the best human beings and the worst computers to do so. (This is what the physicist and mathematician Roger Penrose does when he highlights the ability of higher-level mathematicians to “see” Gödelian “truths”.)It’s hard to reason as to why computers can’t— at least in principle — be suitably programmed to make sense of ambiguous or contradictory messages. Sure, it would need a lot of detailed and fine-tuned programming; though human beings also need a lot of detailed and fine-tuned programming to make sense out of ambiguous or contradictory messages.(4) To recognise the relative importance of different elements of a situationIf anything, a computer could be better at recognising the relative importance of different elements of a situation than many human beings. (A point which also applies to some of the other abilities cited by Hofstadter.) This would of course depend on the “situation” and its “different elements”. In addition, we’d need to know how exactly humans recognise the relative importance of different elements of a situation and if it would be possible — or impossible - to replicate this cognitive ability in computers. As it is, this ability — as expressed by Hofstadter — is almost too vague to comment upon.(5) To find similarities between situations despite differences which may separate themAs already stated, some of these responses may be getting a little repetitive. This is because what can be said about one ability for intelligence — in relation to computers — can be said about others too. Thus the main response to (5) can also be found in (6) below.A computer could be better at finding similarities between situations despite differences which may separate them than most — or even all — human beings. That primarily because a computer may have easy access to a huge amount of data. Of course human beings also have easy access to a huge amount of data (in memory, by reading books, etc.) too. A computer may, of course, find many irrelevant or useless similarities between situations — which are otherwise different — without “knowing” that they are in fact irrelevant or useless… yet the same is true of some human beings in some circumstances. So it must now be said that computer programmers have spent much time “training” computers to ignore irrelevant or useless information and therefore irrelevant or useless similarities or differences. (See Daniel Dennett’s ‘Cognitive wheels: the frame problem of AI’.)(6) To draw distinctions between situations despite similarities which may link themThe ability to draw distinctions between situations despite similarities which may link them too is hard to grasp because it’s a fairly vague ability. And again it must be said that a computer could be very good at this. After all, some computers have very-easy access to a vast amount of data which they can quickly sort out. Admittedly, a large data pool may not be helpful here if the computer hasn’t got the ability to “draw distinctions” in the first place. However, that’s unless a computer — or its programme — contains something that enables it to draw distinctions. And then we’d need to know how that can — or could — be done.As it is, computers (or programmes) do often make the mistake of linking things which are really dissimilar (as in Internet searches based on word connections); rather than of drawing distinctions between things which are otherwise similar. But, here again, many adult human beings do this too. After all, don’t psychologists tell that adult human beings tend to automatically use (or employ) “stereotypes” and “generalisations” in which clear distinctions are ignored and vague similarities are emphasised?(7) To synthesize new concepts by taking old concepts and putting them together in new waysIt can be intuitively accepted that this ability does seem to go beyond what computers will be capable of… at least at the present time. It does seem like a problem to get a computer to take “old concepts” and put them “together in new ways”. This would require a lot of semantic nous and contextual skill.Yet all this depends.It depends on which kind of concepts are being discussed. It may even depend on what’s meant by the word “concept”. Computers can certainly — and with ease — shuffle numbers and equations around. They can even answer questions that haven’t been asked before — and surely that would require putting old concepts together in new ways.(8) To come up with ideas which are novelFirstly we’d also need to establish what an “idea” is. Computers can, after all, establish their own theorems (although a distinction has to be made between proving theorems and creating them — see here), design better routes from A to B, connect given sets of data to other data, respond to human questions which themselves express ideas (say, in Internet searches, etc.) and so on.In any case, surely it would be very easy for a computer to come up with ideas which are novel. What’s important is whether those novel ideas would also be interesting, informative, useful and relevant. In other words, novelty in itself can be a very shallow phenomenon. That said, even if it is a shallow phenomenon, it may still be something that computers are very bad at. As it is, it’s hard to say if computers are bad at creating novel ideas because the notion is fairly vague and/or broad. I suppose we can say — and few AI aficionados would at present deny it — that no computer could come up with a novel theory for a new form of political government or a solution to the mind-body problem. That said, most humans couldn’t do these things either. In addition, it isn’t — in principle — impossible that a computers could do these things.Finally, no one is claiming that any computer can do these kinds of thing today. The claim is that it is possible — and even very likely — that some of these things will be done in the future by computers or by other examples of AI.[I can be found on Twitter here.]Don’t forget to give us your 👏 !",,2021-05-13T14:10:14.190Z,,,,,,https://becominghuman.ai/douglas-hofstadters-eight-abilities-for-intelligence-humans-vs-artificial-intelligence-b6953af1ace4,,,,b6953af1ace4,['Paul Austin Murphy'],

The Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) has warned artificial intelligence tools could also be used to track the amount of time spent on social media.Advertisement
In a submission to the Department of Employment on the introduction of the right to request remote working, the ICTU urged the Government to develop clear guidance on how employers can monitor employees working remotely.
In the submission, ICTU social policy officer Dr Laura Bambrick warned working from homes or hubs could involve technology that can count keystrokes and emails, or even use photographic records taken via webcam.
“Trust is crucial for remote working arrangement to be effective,” the ICTU said.
Necessary monitoring
AdvertisementDr Bambrick said employers, remote workers and office-based colleagues needed to trust that work will be completed in a timely manner and that productivity will not suffer due to remote working.Advertisement
An employer is already permitted to monitor activities within limits, she said, such as monitoring the use of the company’s phone and email.
“However, all monitoring must be necessary, legitimate and proportionate to workers’ right to privacy,” the ICTU said.
“An employer’s ICT policy must clearly make workers aware of any monitoring and must set out why monitoring may take place, the nature of the monitoring, how information will be used, and who will have access to it.
“Covert surveillance is only permitted in exteme cases, such as if there are grounds to suspect criminal activity or serious malpractice, and only for a limited period.”Advertisement
AI-driven technology used to monitor employee activity while working from home can count the number of mouse clicks, keystrokes, emails in an hour
The ICTU said it was concerned by “the general trend” towards the use of AI-powered technologies by employers, for purposes including candidate selection, performance evaluation and redundancy decisions.
“AI-driven technology used to monitor employee activity while working from home can count the number of mouse clicks, keystrokes, emails in an hour, record time spent on social media sites, and take photographic ‘timecards’ every 10 minutes via a webcam,” it said.
“In the EU draft regulations on the use of AI applications, published last week, AI systems used in employment, worker management, and access to platform work were classed as high-risk.”
Dr Bambrick said for many workers, flexible and remote working was not just an optional “nice to have” perk of the job, but vital to be able to enter or remain in employment.
“Congress, therefore, recommends the legislation requires employers to publish flexible and remote working options in job adverts and gives the new postholder the right to take up the advertised flexibility from day one,” the ICTU said.

BMW Uses Artificial Intelligence to Create Its Newest Art Car Series
Published: May 15, 2021  | By: American Luxury StaffBMW’s reveal of its newest Art Car series entry is perhaps best accompanied by a thought-provoking presentation by the automaker that looks at AI-powered design.The new BMW design halos came about by designer-AI partnership, and to foreground the introduction of the car by recapping news about AI forays into art and the ‘generational design’ pieces that come about through artistic or artisanal manipulation of algorithmic learning is useful. The process has come to be called ‘co-creativity,’ and it illuminates the role of AI in artistic creation and industrial and architectural design.BMW titles the 8-series lineup — there are three this time around instead of one — under the heading of The Ultimate AI Masterpiece. BMW used California-based tech company Nvidia’s AI-driven ‘StyleGAN’ software to pack 50,000 artworks representing nearly a millennium of human history and 50 contemporary works into the mix. Gary Yeh — who founded appreciation organization ArtDrunk — and creative tech-friendly designer Nathan Shipley helped guide the project.COVID-19 isolation provided the time and space to conceptualize the project, work it through and bring the gran tourers to the stage. It appears that at least seven distinct finished 8-Series Art Cars were completed for this latest round. Each design given the green light is an amalgam, and in some cases oddly cohesive.Will AI-generated work ever be considered art? The well-publicized 2018 sale of an AI algorithm-created portrait netted almost $450K, but the jury’s out when it comes to calling it a work of art.But ‘co-creativity’ is only just beginning.
