The study, conducted by researchers at Cornell and Hebrew University of Jerusalem, details how humans were pitted against machines in a series of games. (Dan Robitzski provides a nice summary of the results in Futurism.)
As one (human) study participant put it: “I felt very stressed competing with the robot. In some rounds, I kept seeing the robot’s score increasing out of the corner of my eye, which was extremely nerve-racking.”









AI, at your service.

The key is to help employees get comfortable, and trained and ready to collaborate -- not compete -- with AI systems. Business leaders are hoping that their employees are going to be accepting of AI in their worklives, because companies have big plans for AI -- and many hope that it will ultimately extend -- not replace -- worker capabilities. A recent study of 1,200 business leaders and 14,000 workers, conducted by Accenture Research, suggests AI will bring about significant changes to peoples' daily tasks, essentially redefining or redesigning their current jobs. Nearly half of the executives surveyed (46 percent) said that ""traditional job descriptions are obsolete"" as machines take on routine tasks, and as people move to project-based work. Executives at 29 percent of the most advanced AI companies  leaders report that they have already extensively redesigned jobs.
PROMOTED
The Accenture  survey found close to three quarters of executives (74 percent) plan to use AI to automate tasks to a ""large"" or a ""very large extent"" in the next three years. At the same time, almost all (97 percent) also say its purpose is to enhance worker capabilities. They envision their people productively collaborating with intelligent machines.
At the same time, executives underestimate the willingness of employees to acquire the relevant skills,  according to the report's authors, Ellyn Shook and Mark Knickrehm, both with Accenture. On average, executives deem only about a quarter (26 percent) of their workforce as ""ready for AI adoption,"" and cite resistance by the workforce as
a key obstacle. However, from the workers' perspective, 68 percent of highly skilled workers and nearly half (48 percent) of their lower-skilled peers are positive about AI’s impact on their work. Overall, 67 percent of workers consider it important to develop their own skills to work with intelligent machines.

So, executives are optimistic that AI will enhance jobs, but don't seem to quite grasp that their employees want to begin learning how to work with AI. To address this disconnect, Shook and Knickrehm provide the following advice to ""reimagine work"" and pivot the workforce in the coming age of AI:
Continually assess tasks and skills, not jobs.  ""Companies need to identify the new kinds of tasks that must be performed,"" and ""allocate those tasks to people or machines."" Such an effort is ongoing and requires constant re-evaluation, ""some companies are finding that they need to correct their initial allocation of work to machines. After all, many AI systems are not fully autonomous and require considerable input and adjustment from humans.""
Create new roles. This is essential, as ""AI enables people to take on higher-value work,"" Shook and Knickrehm state. ""Operational jobs will become more insight-driven and strategic, while mono-skilled roles will become multiskilled."" For example, ""consumer brands will become increasingly dependent on AI chatbots to represent them in the mass market. Personality trainers will be required to develop the appropriate tone, humor and level of empathy needed for different situations. A health care AI agent must appreciate the sensitivity of patients in a different way than a supermarket AI agent would need to appreciate the mood and mindset of a groceries customer.""
Map skills to new roles. In many cases, employees  whose roles have been automated can take on higher-value work, ""using AI and other technologies to provide more informed services to clients,"" the Accenture authors state. ""Take order processing and accounts payable collections. One Accenture client has produced a human–AI hybrid workforce where algorithms predict which orders have issues, such as a risk of cancellation or payment disputes. Employees can therefore spend more time paying attention to high-risk situations and be more proactive in mitigating negative outcomes. This approach has required training people to help them develop a range of expertise and capabilities — from industry sector knowledge to analytics and data interpretation, to the soft skills required to work with customers in new ways.""
Prioritize skills for development.  In the Accenture survey, the most important skills for effective AI deployments include resource management, leadership, communication, complex problem-solving and judgment/decision-making. ""Among the most valuable human skills required to collaborate with AI will be the judgment skills needed to intervene and make or correct decisions when machines struggle to make them,"" Shook and Knickrehm state.
Employ digital learning experiences. ""Digital learning methods, such as virtual reality and augmented reality technologies, can provide realistic simulations to help workers master new manual tasks so they can work with smart machinery,"" the authors state.

We know artificial intelligence technology will change the future of jobs and the labor market. What we don't know yet is how.
In less than a decade, machines could take over 52 percent of the current workload, compared to 29 percent today, according to a report from the World Economic Forum.
It's not all bad news, the report claims. The growth of AI will mean a rise in tech jobs and create more job opportunities in new industries. It is also likely to boost demand for ""human-centric"" jobs that rely on ""intrinsically human qualities.""
Here's an overview of industries already feeling the impact of AI.
The AI will see you now 
Inline illustrations by Tom Jay for POLITICO
When a woman gets a mammogram in Europe, it’s standard practice virtually everywhere for two radiologists to take a look at the X-rays to check for signs of breast cancer. Soon, that second opinion could come from a computer.
A range of private companies around the world, from small startups to global tech behemoths, are developing software that uses artificial intelligence to analyze medical images. Berlin-based MX Healthcare, for example, trained its software on a data set of up to 1 million mammograms.
But a diagnosis, even if dispatched with breathtaking speed, isn't able to replicate the relational quality and therapeutic nature of the doctor-patient relationship. Health and disease are strongly influenced by emotional, subjective and social factors that for machines are difficult to access.
Robot Picasso 
Can robots be creative? Judging by a canvas sold by auction house Christie's last year for €380,000 — nearly 45 times the highest estimate of its worth — they can be.
The artwork was created by a trio of 25-year-old French students who used a machine-learning algorithm to create the image. The resulting portrait — ""Edmond de Belamy, from La Famille de Belamy"" — is the first piece of AI-generated art to come to auction and it's unlikely to be the last.
A U.K.-based robotics company this year will launch Ai-Da, the first ever robot artist to draw without any human input. The ""ultra-realistic humanoid robot"" — which was made to look like a female artist —  will draw people from sight using a microchip in her eye and a pencil in her bionic hand.
New kid in the bus lane 
Experiments with self-driving cars reach back to the 1980s — with varying degrees of success. And as automakers continue to hone the technology of autonomous cars for individual consumers, researchers are also looking into making self-driving buses a reality.
In Stockholm, two self-driving shuttle buses last year started sharing the road with pedestrians, cyclists and other vehicles, driving at a speed of up to 24 kilometers per hour. The Swiss town of Neuhausen Rheinfall, meanwhile, has fully integrated an all-electric self-driving bus into its regular public transport network.
At the moment, buses in both places are not operated fully autonomously — there is always a driver on board who can take control in case of an emergency. But it's only a matter of time, researchers claim.
Killer robots 
Militaries and manufacturers worldwide are working on weapons that could one day be deployed to fight on their own. Fully autonomous weapons, also known as killer robots, can select and engage targets without human intervention, rendering humans on the frontlines obsolete.
The U.K. has said it wants to use drone squadrons in combat by the end of this year. But the development of killer robots is controversial, with many NGOs and experts calling for a preemptive ban, and 61 percent of people opposing its development, according to a 2018 global poll.
Last September, the European Parliament passed a resolution calling for an international ban on the production and use of weapons that can fire without a human to pull the trigger. Twenty-eight governments have called for a United Nations ban on AI-powered weapons, but the effort has run into strong resistance from military powers such as Russia, the United States, South Korea, Israel and Australia.
Automatic asset managers 
Would you trust a robot to manage your money? Banks and financial services companies are increasingly planning to incorporate AI technology into their business models. Some already have.
Robo-advisers, AI-driven virtual financial advisers, are cheaper than their human counterparts and prove to be better in managing long-term funds, Süddeutsche Zeitung reported.
In 2018 — a difficult year for the stock market — Germany's 12 biggest mixed equity funds lost 8 percent, while funds managed by the country's 16 robo-advisers fell on average by 6 percent. Germany's most successful robo-adviser has some 35,000 customers who, collectively, have invested more than €1 billion in the company that produced it, Scalable.

		Although still lagging behind Indonesia and Thailand, Singapore is committed to make itself the AI pioneer in the ASEAN region

Self-driving vehicles, dating apps which give out relationship advice, humanoid robots that crack jokes and get upset… With a global market that is expected to reach US$35,870 million by 2025 from its direct revenue sources, artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer just the subject of science fiction books. It’s already here.
According to a study carried out by IDC, in the ASEAN region, AI adoption rates are currently on the rise and growth has almost doubled in comparison to last year.
When it comes to adopting this emerging technology, Indonesia is leading the way, with 24.6% of companies already embracing AI in some capacity. Thailand comes in second and the bronze medal goes to Singapore.
 
 
 













 
 

This is somewhat surprising, considering the city state is normally something of a trailblazer in the region when it comes to embracing new technologies.

It doesn’t look like this trend is set to slow down any time soon, with businesses, startups and the government in Singapore all taking serious steps to reposition themselves as leaders in the AI market.
In 2018, the national initiative AI Singapore (AISG) announced two new initiatives in partnership with the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and the year before that, AI Singapore was set up with express instructions “to catalyse, synergise and boost Singapore’s AI capabilities to power [Singapore’s] future, digital economy.”
 
 
 













 
 

The government has also identified AI as one of the four core technologies essential to the country’s push towards being “digitally ready”.
Embracing the technology could help the country to overcome some of its current economic challenges of slowing growth, falling capital investment, soft workforce growth and decelerated productivity.
Artificial intelligence has the potential to reinvigorate the state-island’s economy and boost its industrial profits as, according to a recent report by Accenture, AI could add up to US$215 billion in gross value across 11 industries by 2035.
 
 
 













 
 

Asia’s First Model AI Governance Framework
At this year’s Davos, the Singaporean government announced it was working with the World Economic Forum’s Centre for Fourth Industrial Revolution (WEF C4IR) to help drive the ethical and responsible deployment of artificially intelligent technologies. The framework is the first of its kind to exist throughout Asia and provides guidance which is both detailed and readily implementable to help organisations throughout the city-state navigate the complex ethical questions that often arise when AI technologies and solutions are deployed.

According to the Singaporean Minister for Communications and Information who announced the Model Framework, it is underpinned by two key principles the will help organisations to ensure: decisions made by or with the assistance of AI are explainable, transparent and fair to consumers and the artificial intelligence solutions they deploy are human-centric.
Singapore has long been pushing to become a global leader in artificial intelligence and this Model Framework will be welcomed by those who work with this emerging technology. It builds on themes that were first raised back in 2018 and pays particular attention to deployments that involve internal governance, risk management, operations management and customer relationship management. Furthermore, it has the full support of the Singaporean Advisory Council on the Ethical Use of AI and Data – a group which consists of international AI leaders, consumer advocates and company leaders and helps to engage stakeholders on issues that support the development of AI governance capabilities and frameworks.
 
 
 













 
 

By announcing the Model Framework and its collaboration with WEF C4IR, Singapore is hoping to advance its position as a leading digital economy and Smart Nation. Being first Asian nation to develop an artificial intelligence framework will not only allow the country to continue investing in and building AI capabilities, it will also allow Singapore to remain competitive on a global scale.
Which industries are already benefiting from AI capabilities?
Healthcare
Healthcare is a field that is already reaping the benefits of AI use in Singapore. AI tools and assistants are now able to detect skin cancers, analyse chest x-rays or perform diabetes screens from a patient’s retina scan.
AI is also showing its value in healthcare research by helping to filter the vast amount of papers and reports that are being produced every year, helping doctors making the best decision when choosing new treatments.
 
 
 













 
 

Dr Joanne Ngeow Yuen Yie, senior consultant at the National Cancer Centre Singapore, thinks that the extensive body of available medical literature is a huge cognitive overload for physicians. “Nearly 60% of doctors are walking out on healthcare because they feel overwhelmed”, she said in a recent seminar titled SGInnovate’s Health Futures: AI & Genomics.
In a pioneering study published in April, scientists at the Agency for Science, Technology and Research’s (A*STAR) Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS) developed a new type of AI known as machine learning computer models to accurately pinpoint roots of gastric cancer.
The AI methods and technology developed through this study will aid researchers in understanding the impact of mutations in non-coding DNA in other types of cancer.  
 
 
 













 
 

Steve Leonard, CEO of SGInnovate, a government-owned company which is also participating in AI Singapore and which funds deep tech startups, believes that the Asian country is positioning itself at the avant-garde of a healthcare AI revolution.
Taking the example of a Singapore-based surgeon who was able to reduce his patients’ recovery period by using robotics in his surgery and thus freeing up beds for other patients, Leonard said that the doctor was “able to get patients out the same day, when it used to take four days for them to recover”.
The biggest challenge for Leonard at the time of applying AI to healthcare lies in the mistrust and discomfort of some patients who might think that robots are replacing human doctors. “Social adoption is a bigger challenge than the technology”, he said. However, “it’s not replacing the doctor – it’s giving a tool to them; just like the stethoscope didn’t replace the doctor”.
 
 
 













 
 

Transport
New legislation coming into effect during the second half of 2018 and that will affect the use of autonomous vehicles in the island-state has recently attracted world attention and made the country a testing ground for this innovative way of transportation.

In 2015, nuTonomy, a self-driving car company that focuses on developing software for autonomous vehicles and mobile robots, began testing self-driving cars in Singapore. Shortly afterwards they partnered with Grab (the most popular shared-ride service in the country) to make autonomous taxis widely available to the general public. However, until this kind of vehicles can be deemed completely safe, all taxis still have a driver in case of an emergency.
Ng Chee Meng, Singapore’s former second minister for transport, reiterated Singapore’s support to autonomous vehicles during a speech at the Committee of Supply Debate last year. “We are focusing on self-driving technology in a big way because they have the potential to dramatically improve public transport”, he said. “Initiatives are underway to develop self-driving buses and to explore how the technology can be applied for use in freight transport and utility vehicles.”
 
 
 













 
 

Taking into account that only 15% of Singaporeans own a car, an expansion of the autonomous cars market would significantly reduce the cost of shared rides and taxis.
Vehicle manufacturers estimate that autonomous vehicle technology will only start to take off between 2025 and 2030, a calculation not shared by nuTonomy, which is looking to launch commercial services in the country this year. Rather than creating cars that are designed to be specifically autonomous, nuTonomy wants to integrate their technology with existing cars and speed up the process of introduction.
Separately, Chinese bike sharing platform Mobike, which has operations in Singapore, uses an AI data monitoring platform to make forecasts of supply and demand for bike rentals to help improve the company’s operational efficiency.
 
 
 













 
 

Airport operations are also implementing AI technologies, particularly with the use of facial recognition to get passengers from the terminal to the aircraft in shorter times. Innovative CT X-ray machines, which do not require passengers to remove their laptops from their bags, are also being implemented.
Early in 2018, the Ministry of Transport said that the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) is launching and Aviation Transformation Programme (ATP) that will promote the use of new technologies, including AI, to improve airport operations.
Financial and business services
The finance and business worlds are also experiencing an increase in AI use in Singapore. In these sectors it’s mainly being applied to enhance customer experience and to drive efficiencies.
 
 
 













 
 

Financial services are using facial recognition technology to resolve issues of verification and thus speeding lending processes.
Business services, covering a wide range of activities from real estate to accounting and legal, are expected to benefit the most from AI in the country.

AI-powered tools can help enhance productivity with document mining, pattern recognition for fraud detection, information extraction and analysis, thus transforming and innovating ways to generate insights.
 
 
 













 
 

Evie.ai, a Singapore-based startup, is behind Evie, an AI scheduling assistant that optimises resources with automation. Apart from scheduling meetings and organising diaries, Evie is able to coordinate calls, follow up with attendees and send out invitations.
AI-enabled legal services could develop an AI engine to automatically review legal contracts and highlight any issues based on a business’s legal policies and in this way ensuring consistency. It could also manage contract approvals and escalation which would get the right tasks to the right people automatically.
Manufacturing
With the world’s leading chemical manufacturing sites, the industry remains an important actor within Singapore’s economy.
 
 
 













 
 

Over 100 global petroleum, petrochemical and speciality chemical companies are housed on 12 square miles of land.

Today, Singapore is the world’s fifth largest refinery export hub and amongst the top ten global chemical hubs by export volume.
Therefore, it would make sense that Singapore focuses its AI potential in the manufacturing industry.
AI adoption would not only make manpower more efficient, it will also lead to the realisation of the full potentials of existing machinery on the factory floor.
 
 
 













 
 

Accenture’s research calculates Singapore’s manufacturing projected growth with AI in 2035 to increase by 40%: that is US$101.1 billion compared to US$71.3 billion without AI.
In late 2015, the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) started a Future of Manufacturing (FoM) Initiative in close consultation with the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI), the Economic Development Board (EDB) and SPRING Singapore under the government’s Research, Innovation & Enterprise 2020 plan. 
The deliberations involved extensive engagement with industry and the trade associations.
The goal of the initiative is to sustain Singapore’s competitiveness in manufacturing and technology innovation so that it is a location of choice for developing, test-bedding and deploying advanced breaking-ground technologies in the manufacturing sector.
The 3 key thrusts of A*STAR’s FoM Initiative are the public-private partnership platforms of Tech Access, Tech Depot and Model Factories, that aim to drive technology innovation, knowledge transfer and adoption across the manufacturing industry.
Retail
The way people shop has changed dramatically since the advancement of digital technologies, resulting in a growing number of retailers now integrated artificial intelligence capabilities into the retail experience.
In Singapore, a company called Untitled Project have made it their mission to remake retail with AI. The services it offers help retail companies to improve everything from the supply chain, to providing a customised shopping experience, and enabling predictive modelling.
Using a number of sophisticated suggestion tools and self-learning AI algorithms which, once implemented, allows consumers find their way easily and quickly across the store and ultimately improves their overall shopping experience.
In addition to enhancing the way we shop; artificial intelligence has already helped to shape buying trends throughout the city state.
One startup, Crayon Data, is helping to do this through its ‘Maya’ product offering. It uses big data and artificial intelligence to map the personal tastes of customers to create personalised, digital experiences for them every time they connect digitally with the retailer of their choice.
Furthermore, everyone from your big-name high-street stores to the newest boutiques are experimenting with AI-enabled chatbots to help improve and enhance the experience of their customers long after they’ve left the store.
Education
When it comes to the education sector, artificial intelligence impacts in two different ways.
First, its through technology that is being developed to actively help teachers to educate their students. EdTech is still in its infancy but research has shown that the need exists, and VCs and investors have started to take note, with a precited US$250million expected to be spent on the tech in 2020.
In one preschool in Singapore, robots have already been brought in to help teach the children. KIBO has been designed to allow young children to take on the role of an engineer, constructing the robot and then using wooden blocks to programme sequential instructions from the robot to follow.
The robotics kit needed to build KIBO doesn’t come with a computer, electronic screen or any other digital device that could lead to criticism about the damaging nature of pro-longed screen time on such young children.
This is not the first robot to assist pre-school teachers in Singapore, however. Two humanoid robots called Pepper and Nao were sent to two schools in 2016 to take part in a 7-month trial. To date, 160 KIBO robots have been sent to pre-schools throughout the country.
The second way artificial intelligence impacts on the education sector is through the global need for more AI talent.
Artificial intelligence is one of the fastest growing sectors and currently, no country in the world has the necessary number of qualified workers to meet current demands.
Like a number of other countries around the world, Singapore is looking to change this with a number of different education initiatives.
One such programme is being led by AI Singapore (AISG) and aims to target around 12,000 industry professionals and young students in an effort to build up local skillsets in AI.
The programme is designed to outline the practical use cases associated with AI whilst simultaneously helping AI professionals to boost productivity through the use of intelligent tools.
AISG are also hoping to raise the importance of having government backing for initiatives such as AI-enabled, user-friendly public services to allow people to see just how vital this technology will be to the future of the country.

BERLIN — Robot reporters have arrived in the newsroom. Algorithms are writing up company earnings, covering sports championships and dabbling in crime and politics. One day, if the techno-optimists are to be believed, they will be doing much of the work journalists do today.
For now, your loyal correspondent’s job seems to be safe. Despite the galloping pace of technological progress, computers are still far from being able to develop sources, provide high-level analysis or infuse a narrative with character and color.
But as news organizations integrate artificial intelligence into their operations, it’s becoming increasingly clear that the media industry — and its workforce — is not safe from disruption.

Automatically generated articles
Robots are already performing routine tasks once done by human reporters.
Once, on mornings when companies published quarterly earning reports, business journalists at the Associated Press would get up early, wait for the numbers and hammer out copy as fast as they could.
“Earnings and sports were obvious for us because they're data driven"" — Lisa Gibbs, AP's director of news partnerships
No longer. In 2014, the AP automated the process. Now, a software monitors the earnings, then spits out a basic story onto the wire in under five minutes — faster than any reporter ever did the job.
Similarly, the newswire has automated its coverage of minor league baseball and college basketball.
“Earnings and sports were obvious for us because they're data driven,” said Lisa Gibbs, AP's director of news partnerships. “The sources of data are clean, and there is a value of having information about them out very quickly.”

The agency estimates it will publish roughly 40,000 automatically generated articles by the end of this year — still just a fraction of the more than 700,000 articles, including revisions, it puts out each year.

The AP is not alone. Newsrooms around the world have begun using software to report on sports scores, earnings' reports and election results. Bloomberg News has automated its earnings coverage. The Washington Post uses software to cover high-school games. The Los Angeles Times has a bot tweeting about earthquakes.
In Europe, the Austrian Press Agency is planning to use software during the upcoming European Parliament election to quickly push out articles with election results from each of Austria's more than 2,000 municipalities. Norwegian news agency NTB said it has been running automatically generated stories about football games for three years, and plans to expand its coverage to the country's minor leagues this year, bringing its automated coverage to up to 170,000 games per year.
Templates
Whatever the subject of the coverage, the process for this kind of automated journalism is similar.
First, reporters identify reliable data sets. They team up with programmers to write a template spelling out what a story needs to say, how it is supposed to sound and what possible variations there should be: Have the earnings of a company “soared,” or have they “plummeted”?
After any glitches are ironed out, the software is let off its leash to write its stories. But this doesn’t mean that the work of the journalists is done: At the AP, reporters still make tweaks to headlines, or mess around with some of the language. And they continue to monitor developments that might make their templates out of date.

If the U.S., for instance, decides to make changes to its tax law, business editors must decide whether to turn off automation because the risk of stories being inaccurate or incomplete is too high.
“We have editors now who used to spend their time writing and editing earning stories,” said Gibbs, who led the AP’s business desk when it first introduced automated reporting. “Now it’s about maintaining a very large database.”
Her agency currently has no plans to expand the use of automatically generated articles into other areas, she said, adding that “we're not in the business of automating things just because we can.”
Storytelling
In the fall of 2015, researchers from “Structured Stories,” a now-dormant academic project, approached reporters covering car chases in a local NBC Los Angeles newsroom with a request.
After the journalists filed a story, they were asked to enter facts about the incident into a database.
Every car chase is different, but if you think about them as narrative structures, they all have reoccurring plot elements. Every chase has a triggering event: someone is killed or a police officer notices a speeding vehicle. And every pursuit has an ending: an accident, a surrender, a shooting. By compiling enough examples, the researchers were seeking to teach their machines how to cover a car chase.

And it worked. The subfield of artificial intelligence underlying most newsroom robots is called “natural language generation” — or NLG. The basic idea is that if you want a computer to be able to write something, you must provide it with the information in a form it is able to process, and then you have to teach it how to use it.
Using examples from more than 60 car chases, the researchers came up with a way to encode the races so that a computer could understand them and a template for a typical story about an L.A. car chase. When they fed it data from another chase, the software spit out an article that read like classic journalistic prose:
Driver Drives Off 300 Ft Cliff During Pursuit
July 13th, 2015 (Point Fermin Park, San Pedro, California) — A vehicle pursuit that began in Wilmington during the late evening of July 13th later ended with the crash of the suspect in Point Fermin Park, San Pedro. The incident began at about 11:00 PM when an unidentified driver, driving a Toyota Prius, fled from officers of the Los Angeles Port Police following a traffic stop on Pacific Coast Highway in Wilmington. The suspect was then pursued by the LAPP along Alameda Street to San Pedro, and then further along Alameda Street to Point Fermin Park in San Pedro. The incident concluded with the crash of the suspect in Point Fermin Park, where the suspect drove over a cliff. The unidentified suspect was injured. Referring to the incident, witness Manuel Castro said ""We peeked our heads and it was just a gray Prius and we saw the wreckage and the cops over here."" The suspect was treated for injuries at the scene and was expected to be arrested. 
What made this experiment different from articles about quarterly earnings reports is that the machines weren’t just punching numbers into a template. They were recounting a series of events. In other words, they were telling stories.
The outcome proved that ""it’s possible to represent most news stories, and certainly formulaic news stories, as data, and it is also possible to generate news products, say articles, that are very similar to what journalists produce,” said David Caswell, who oversaw the ""Structured Stories"" project before joining the BBC last year as the executive product manager of its News Labs incubator.

Mass production
Robot journalists are not yet able to produce articles by themselves, beyond stenography-style reporting about straightforward facts. Even in cases where they’re able to write the story, they still need human reporters to tell them how to process information first. They serve primarily as virtual assistants, allowing one journalist to do work that might have required dozens — if not hundreds.
That’s the idea behind Radar, an “automated news service” that offers a glimpse at the cutting edge of computer-assisted journalism.
Radar — the name is an acronym for “Reporters and Data and Robots” — was launched in September 2017 as a joint venture of the U.K.'s Press Association and startup Urbs Media, with more than €700,000 of funding from Google’s News Initiative.
It seeks to use the vast but often untapped troves of public data that is released by the British government and other institutions, some of which drills down to the level of the U.K.'s hundreds of local authorities.
“In a way, these tools make it more likely that more of us will be able to do more sophisticated reporting"" — Lisa Gibbs
A story produced by Radar starts like any other: with an idea. The group’s reporters root around data sets, looking for something interesting. ""To my mind, the best judge to a story is still a human journalist rather than a machine,"" said Radar Editor-in-Chief Gary Rogers.

Once the team has identified a subject worth picking up — say, how often ambulances are delayed across the U.K. — reporters might make some phone calls or conduct interviews to understand the broader context and harvest general quotes for their articles.
Only then does the automation begin. The reporters write a template, which will allow them to generate hundreds of individual articles from just one data set — in this case, noting how often ambulances are delayed in the community and how that compares to the national average.
They add some analysis and feed it into their NLG software, which spits out hundreds of ""localized"" articles Radar offers to its subscribers.

Sometimes, local newsrooms publish the stories as they come in; sometimes, they have their own journalists pick them up, do additional reporting and turn them into larger features.
Radar’s team of five reporters, plus the startup’s two founders, hammers out around 8,000 stories per month, covering issues ranging from crime to transport, education, environment, health and social policy.
Some of the data they use has been available for years but had remained, so far, untouched by journalists — partly because so many local U.K. newspapers have shut down, and partly because much of the material is too detailed for it ever to have been profitable for human reporters working on their own.

""We're using NLG technologies as a writing tool, in effect,"" said Rogers.
Tailored content
Newsroom executives interviewed for this article argued that rather than making journalists redundant, robot reporters will allow them to focus on elements of the job that add more value.
Historically, in most newsrooms, only a small fraction of reporters have been free to truly dig deep into stories. Many of the tasks being performed can be — or one day soon could be — done by robots.
“In a way, these tools make it more likely that more of us will be able to do more sophisticated reporting,” said Gibbs, who now leads AP’s newsroom AI efforts.
Traditionally, most journalism is a single-use product. A reporter is assigned a story, gathers information, and then writes. Over time, they build up sources and knowledge, and get better at what they do — but when it comes to the writing part, they have to start fresh each time.
“The editorial side of journalism is going to be more important than ever. But it’s going to be completely different"" — David Caswell, BBC

That's where robot-journalists could revolutionize the business, technologists like the BBC’s David Caswell believe. He envisions that instead of writing articles, breaking news reporters of the future will work on templates that — fed with new data — can produce a limitless number of stories.
Newsrooms will build up libraries of templates, enabling them to quickly produce stories, sometimes for multiple audiences. The reporting about a car chase in L.A. could, for example, be run through five templates, producing, in turn, a short summary, a listicle, a colloquial blog post, a colorful article with lots of detail and a version in Spanish for the city’s Latino community.
“The editorial side of journalism is going to be more important than ever,” said Caswell. “But it’s going to be completely different.”
'Double-edged sword'
For some journalists, that will mean new opportunities. For others, it could mean having to learn new skills — or risk losing their jobs.
Some fields of journalism — investigative projects, magazine features, in-depth political and business analysis, op-eds and commentaries — seem, for now, to be safe from technologies like NLG.
Templates and databases can only do so much. “You can’t automate creative writing,” said Alexander Siebert, one of the CEOs of Berlin-based tech company Retresco. “Artificial intelligence can grasp the structure of grammar and turn data into creative language — but the ‘creative idea’ is and remains in the hands of humans. It will take many additional years of research until this can be done by machines.”

But other newsroom areas could see significant disruption.
""There are new ways of doing journalism that will be completely accessible and possible for new generations of journalists,” said Caswell.  “But it’s maybe harder for older journalists to adapt to those kinds of thinking.""
""If the emphasis on AI … is motivated to further reduce costs and resources — meaning people’s jobs — then that’s a problem"" — Sarah Kavanagh, Senior NUJ official
To write templates, journalists will have to learn to look for recurring patterns in whatever they're covering — similarly to what computer scientists and developers do when they write code. Such computational thinking is a skill most working journalists currently lack.
“It’s essential that employers provide training,” said Sarah Kavanagh, a senior campaigns and communications officer at the U.K.’s National Union of Journalists.
Kavanagh described recent efforts to automate reporting in the industry as a “double-edged sword.” While her union welcomes the use of technology, including AI, to enhance reporting — particularly in underserved news deserts — she also warned that the option to automate reporting could bring newsrooms to lay off reporters.

Similarly, disruptive innovations had been used in the past, she warned, ""in a way that is it not supporting quality, sustainable journalism, but about cutting costs.”
“If there are technological tools that are developed that will help people to dig into lots of information and to save time in their work of journalists, then … they should be welcomed,” she said. “But if the emphasis on AI … is motivated to further reduce costs and resources — meaning people’s jobs — then that’s a problem.”
Fake news
Just what changes artificial intelligence will ultimately bring to the newsroom is still unclear. While there are distinct limits to NLG, other avenues are just being explored.
“It’s not far-fetched to assume that in five to 10 years from now, technology will be at a place that, depending on the story one is writing, the machine will just make suggestions about sentences, or an outline for the piece,” said Seth Lewis, an emerging media researcher at the University of Oregon.
Enter ""deep learning.""
Unlike NLG, where computers are told what to do, deep learning analyzes vast troves of data and learns from that experience. That makes it highly effective, but it also turns computers into black boxes, making it impossible to fully understand the reasons behind their decisions.

In February, the American nonprofit OpenAI made headlines when it said it had created a software that uses ""deep learning"" to generate text and that it is so good — and has so much potential for misuse — that it wouldn’t release its full research.
Human journalists might not be superseded by robot reporters just yet | Image via iStock
It was trained by being fed 8 million documents. Using an approach similar to the predictive text generator on a smartphone, the program produces articles that read like near-perfect prose by predicting what word is likely to follow another one.
The only problem: As authentic as the stories may seem, the facts they contain are completely made up. Asked to generate an article about the OECD, the software created a straightforward news piece, including a fabricated quote attributed to a chairperson at the organization.
This makes the program, arguably, a potential competitor to fiction writers, novelists or poets, who aren't necessarily constrained by the facts. But it's much less useful for reporters, whose job is to stick to the truth.
For journalists, including your loyal correspondent, that should come as a relief. We won’t have to dust off our resumes. At least not yet.

In a world where technology is constantly evolving, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become prevalent in our everyday routine, whether we realize it or not.
But what about cybersecurity? As multiple systems continuously gather and transmit information, how can the government ensure the safety of that information? To fully understand the capabilities of AI, it takes teams of highly skilled researchers in an innovative workspace to analyze the competencies of these machines and understand why they do the things they do.
“I’m a little hesitant to define artificial intelligence since it has always sounded a little too much like science fiction to me,” says Liz Russell, an Applied Research Mathematician at National Security Agency (NSA). She splits the concept of AI into two sectors: machine learning and data science. Machine learning is the process in which a system learns trends to make predictions, whereas data science revolves around using large sets of data to make observations.
Liz tackles both in her everyday work.
“I research national security problems where a machine learning or data science solution might be appropriate,” she explains. “The problems typically come from intelligence analysts hoping for better ways to handle or answer questions involving large sets of data.”
In other words, she’s a data-mining superhero who comes up with solutions for some of the nation’s most complex technological problems.
“Before I came to NSA, I had the same false impression that most people probably have about federal agencies: suits and dark sunglasses,” she jokes. “When I got here, I was surprised to see so many people like me.”
“Before I came to NSA, I had the same false impression that most people probably have about federal agencies: suits and dark sunglasses.”
She commends NSA for its supportive culture and opportunities to grow. Liz has been enrolled in the Cryptologic Mathematician Development Program, where she did rotational tours throughout the agency in her first three years at NSA, and the Advanced Studies Program, which allowed her the time to further her education. She also served as a mentor for NSA’s graduate math internship.
Through these experiences, Liz utilized her skills in different ways, expanded her knowledge of the agency and was exposed to a broad variety of situations.
“In addition, NSA has funded me to attend many conferences and workshops to refine my practical knowledge of machine learning techniques and to meet professionals in the larger community,” she says. Coupled with employee development programs, these are just a few of the many ways NSA fosters the advancement of its employees.
NSA not only hires top talent, but it also has a wealth of technical support and subject matter experts that make its collaborative work environment stand out from the rest. From analysts to statisticians and mathematicians like herself, Liz says the incredible community of experts is what makes NSA different and creates a productive atmosphere that promotes cooperation.
One of the most satisfying aspects of Liz’s career is that she feels connected to the mission. Prior to working at NSA, she was an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at the U.S. Military Academy, also known as West Point, where she was working alongside military personnel every day.
“I have hundreds of former students and old colleagues who are active duty members of our military. I know that my work at NSA impacts their lives directly; it’s a feeling that is both humbling and a little scary.”
This connection is what drives Liz to excel in her line of work and make a positive impact in the Intelligence Community.
“Every project that NSA offices support  – crypt, research, operations, you name it – directly supports programs that aid warfighters, thwart terrorist activity and support the security of the United States,” she says. “The reason why we work so hard is always clear.”
“The reason why we work so hard is always clear.”
If you’re passionate about making a difference in the Intelligence Community, NSA is always searching for the best and brightest to help safeguard the nation. With perks like generous leave programs, affordable healthcare benefits and flexible hours to give you the perfect balance between work and life, your road to a rewarding career can start here.

7wireVentures Perspective on the Expectations and Future of Artificial Intelligence


Given the technological development of Artificial Intelligence, market adoption trends, and recognition of value potential, we believe there will be newly reconstructed processes leveraged by the healthcare workforce that ultimately impact the delivery of healthcare services. Such processes should provide a consistent feed of data to Artificial Intelligence tools that will continuously evolve and improve models. Ultimately, as the technology matures and becomes further integrated into the healthcare system, more roles and strategies for human work to be complemented by machines will arise.
PREDICTION 1: HEALTHCARE ROLES WILL BE REFORMED TO INTEGRATE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
Considering this new human and machine mix, some functions of existing roles will be modified and optimized with the integration of Artificial Intelligence. An estimated 64% of healthcare roles will be impacted and these jobs will need to be re-engineered to optimize the value of the talent portfolio.[1]











FIGURE 1: Estimated Percentage of Tasks to be Automated from Select Roles




As a result, new capabilities will be required to meet patient needs and appropriately leverage tools. When hiring talent, organizations should consider how skill needs will change as digital solutions evolve, and how they can leverage new sourcing channels to fill gaps as needed.
This redesign of talent roles and functions also aligns with a shift within healthcare payers towards project work: 79% of payer executives note that work in the future will be structured by projects rather than job functions.[2] This enables payers to develop recruiting strategies and programs aimed at reskilling workers, including training on AI-enabled tools, and to invest in automation, digital tools and Artificial Intelligence solutions that will improve employee performance and engagement.
Given the maturity timeline of Specialized AI of 10+ years, the near-term integration of machine learning tools will augment the intelligence of providers rather than outright replace a majority of current tasks. As a result, human responsibilities (e.g., clinical, administrative and technology) will extend to training models, explaining results, and sustaining model efficacy. In return, machines will enhance human capabilities by amplifying speed and accuracy, interacting with patients and providers, and learning to embody provider characteristics.
 
PREDICTION 2: PHYSICIANS SHOULD BECOME MORE INTEGRATED IN THE DESIGN OF AI TOOLS FOR OPTIMAL SUCCESS 
The value potential created by providers leveraging AI tools is only possible with those who are willing to adopt such technologies. While generating substantial evidence is a key facilitator in gaining provider adoption, integrating provider knowledge early into the design of AI-powered tools not only increases willingness of user adoption and confidence in the technology, but it also improves accuracy of the model. Strategic physician insights and their ability to handle edge cases that break rules and patterns will become increasingly important in model design to improve efficacy.
Physician input can help identify key checkpoints and ultimately improve algorithm performance.  Given that for many tools, physicians only gain insight into the results and have limited transparency into key assumptions of the process, involving providers early can highlight areas where increased transparency or checkpoints are required. Physicians can also provide insight on how humans handle anomalies or conflicting pieces of clinical information that software might overlook in favor of the dominant pattern. Additionally, physicians might be better equipped to identify biases than programmers working off of decontextualized data.
As AI evolves from Specialized to Generalized and begins to operate on deep learning protocols – where machines learn to reprogram themselves without human intervention—provider experience and institutional knowledge will be critical for designing the most doctor-like decision making process.
 
PREDICTION 3: AI WILL ENABLE GREATER PATIENT SELF-CARE
Our thesis at 7wireVentures is that successful healthcare leaders will drive towards empowering an Informed, Connected Health Consumer. Aligning with this belief, as the trend of consumerism perpetuates, patients will become more familiar with and increasingly want to receive care on their own terms similar to other non-healthcare products and services.
Accenture estimates that self-care will meet up to 10% of demand for healthcare services by 2030. Healthcare consumers are already using technology-enabled tools, such as biometric devices and wearables for self-care. Physician willingness to integrate tools also matches their interest- with nearly 66% of physicians noting they “would prescribe an app to help patients manage their chronic diseases.”
Tools such as virtual nurses, technologically-enabled home-monitoring devices, and digital therapeutics are applications that enable personalized patient self-care powered by Artificial Intelligence.
The future healthcare consumer will be familiar with patient self-care and expect to engage in self-care activities both prior to engaging with a provider and as part of ongoing treatment post engagement.

A new machine learning eye disease screening tool wasn't conceived by an eye doctor, or any physician for that matter, but by a research scientist at Google with an interest in artificial intelligence. That scientist, Varun Gulshan, was looking for a medical or science project that might ideally help people in his home country of India.But since no one on the Google team had any experience creating medical devices, turning the AI model into an actual medical device required turning the project over to Verily, Alphabet's healthcare and life sciences research arm.Three years later, eye doctors at Aravind Eye Hospital in Madurai, India, are using that machine learning algorithm to screen patients for diabetic retinopathy, with the aim of using technology to fill gaps in patient access to eye doctors. By integrating the machine learning algorithm into their screening process, hospital physicians have more time to work closely with patients on treatment while increasing the number of screenings that can be performed.The real-world clinical use of the machine learning-enabled screening tool—essentially an algorithm trained to quickly interpret retinal scans for signs of disease—marks an important step in taking AI from research to the patient bedside. And it's an example of Verily's quietly expanding footprint in the world of healthcare and its ambitions to lead the industry in overcoming challenges that have so far stymied the broader use of AI in clinical care.""I think our unique role here is taking and understanding what’s currently going on with health conditions, but then saying, what new tools could be used? I think the diabetic retinopathy program is a great example of that,"" Jessica Mega, M.D., chief medical and scientific officer at Verily, told FierceHealthcare. In her work as a cardiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital and a medical researcher, Mega explored novel cardiovascular therapies and using genetics to tailor therapies to patients. Leading Verily's clinical efforts builds on her interest in the use of technology to solve complex health problems, she said. Diabetes-related eye disease presented a good clinical use case for machine learning because it is a significant healthcare problem: diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of preventable blindness in adults, Mega said.RELATED: Google, Verily use machine learning to detect diabetic eye disease“If you think about AI and image recognition and all of the advances, even outside of healthcare, you can take those tools and apply it to something like reading an eye scan,"" Mega said. ""It’s the perfect marriage of a medical situation that is high need and technology that has matured in the last few years with the end goal of reducing blindness.”Proof of conceptGoogle and Verily—both under the Alphabet umbrella—have been conducting a clinical research program with a focus on India, where studies involving Aravind as well as Sankara Nethralaya, an eye hospital in Chennai, India, demonstrated that the algorithm performed on par with general ophthalmologists and retinal specialists assessing the images for disease. According to Verily officials, the two companies started the clinical research in India due to an increasing need to expand access to screenings there. There is a shortage of more than 100,000 eye doctors, and only 6 million out of 72 million people with diabetes are screened for the eye disease, the companies said. Hospital officials are optimistic that technology can help fill that gap.Verily, originally Google Life Sciences, once part of Google X, was spun out back in 2015 to lead Alphabet’s healthcare and life sciences research.Mega joined the research organization before the spinout and said early work on the algorithm for the retinal imaging program began within Google. “Over time, we realized it was best to co-develop the product going forward because it’s one thing to have an algorithm and it’s another thing to wrap it around with what it really means to have an end-to-end solution that clinicians can start using. On the Verily side, we bring some of the clinical expertise, the regulatory expertise, and the quality systems to bring this clinical product to market.”At the same time, Mega acknowledged that integrating machine learning into care delivery is a significant challenge. “You’re going to see this across the board, with people coming up with an interesting idea, but how do you actually scale this? How do you get the right tools, in this case, getting the right image of the eye with the algorithm that’s working in real time, and then getting a clinical diagnosis? We’ve been working hard on making this a reality.”RELATED: More clinical evidence needed to accelerate adoption of AI-enabled decision support: reportCurrently, one limitation is getting the technology to work in different clinical environments in order to scale it. “There are tools that may work in certain urban centers, but if you want to have a global impact, how do you create tools that work in rural environments?”As part of the research program in India, physicians and screening technicians at Aravind vision centers in remote locations continue to test the screening tool. One challenge they are trying to tackle is the quality of the images coming in as the remote clinics use different technology. “We’re using this as a testing environment to see what is going to work and what we can scale,” Mega said.Mega sees use cases for AI in other clinical applications including imaging, pathology, radiology, and clinical decision support. “It’s a tool to help us solve clinical problems, and I think we’re going to see this tool used more and more,” she said.Verily’s work at the intersection of healthcare and technologyThe retinal imaging program is one of more than a dozen Verily healthcare partnerships and projects. Onduo, a Verily-Sanofi collaboration launched two years ago, is a digital diabetes management program that provides patients with sensors and other tools to manage their conditions and access to a virtual clinic.“We’re bringing in continuous glucose data to try to get a deeper understanding of the biology and wrap that around with support to improve outcomes with diabetes,” she said. “We’re starting to see some early positive signals.”The Project Baseline study is much broader in scope and aims to collect patient data from myriad sources—sensors, imaging, EHRs—to study the transition from health to illness. The company is partnering with Duke University and Stanford Medicine to collect, organize and analyze broad phenotypic health data from approximately 10,000 people over the course of four years.“We have programs and projects that are addressing today’s health situations, but we want to think broadly about what health looks like in the next 10 to 20 years,” Mega said.As clinicians and researchers look to integrate AI into medical practice, the technology raises some ethical questions: how do clinicians understand what comes out of a technology “black box” and how do they avoid bias in the algorithms? Many medical groups, including radiologists, are tackling these issues.Addressing the issue of bias, Mega said many of the same principles of developing clinical trials apply to the development of AI systems.“Think about a clinical trial, if you only have a very limited sample, or you only recruit people with a certain background, then the question is, do the results that you see generalize to the broader population? We just need to have that level of rigor when it comes to AI,” she said. “We need to make sure that when we create, train and then validate algorithms that we’re dealing with a diversity of input and make sure that this is going to be representative of the population.”

I think unless you actually create jobs and wealth, it’s great that you have this research, but without commercialization it means nothing.“We should be world leaders in health and A.I., in oil and gas and A.I. and so on … Hopefully what we have here is a cluster out of artificial intelligence and machine learning, and the next big boom will come out of that.“All software in the next decade will have an element of A.I. and M.L. as a part of it. We want to be a part of building out those platforms, those applications. We’ll be kind of the smaller, grittier, blue-collar one (A.I. company) that picks our fight.”Janssen is a master at creating interesting work for himself, having started out as an entrepreneur when he was still a U of A business student. In the late 1990s tech boom, when investors were flocking to put money into dot-com start-ups, Janssen and friend Cory Wagner rented a cramped downtown office and went to work on a number of ideas, one of which they built into Investopedia.com, a financial education website.Headline NewsGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.There was an error, please provide a valid email address.Sign UpBy signing up you consent to receive the above newsletter from Postmedia Network Inc.Thanks for signing up!A welcome email is on its way.

Instead, they started to build out an investment dictionary, thinking it was timeless content that might attract traffic for years.Investopedia quickly became one of the fastest growing businesses in the province and the largest financial website in Canada, all from a tiny Edmonton office. “That’s one of the great things about the internet, it’s an equalizer,” Janssen says. “The proof is in the pudding. We drove results. It didn’t matter we were a bunch of 22-year-old Canadians teaching Americans how to invest.”In 2007, Wagner and Janssen sold Investopedia.com to Forbes.Afterwards, Janssen built on the same model, starting businesses like Techopedia, Safeopedia and Corrosionpedia.He also hooked up with the U of A’s machine learning crew when he tried to find a way to get computers to generate rough drafts of articles for his various sites. They had no success whatsoever in this attempt, Janssen says, partly because they had taken on an extremely complex and difficult problem.Advertisement 4Story continues belowArticle contentBut the challenge made Janssen think about the potential of A.I. He then realized the U of A computing science department had grown into one of the most elite institutions on earth for artificial intelligence and machine learning.“I was amazed at the quality of M.L. engineers and data scientists there was at the university,” he says. “I felt like an idiot for not actually realizing that this (A.I. expertise) was here. And meanwhile all the profs at the U of A are like, ‘How come no one gives us any respect? How come no one realizes what we’re doing here?'”Janssen’s new company AltaML has gone from zero to 40 people in 14 monthsTo engage in machine learning, Janssen says you need both data to mine and a problem to tackle. Large Alberta businesses have both data and efficiency issues.When he first approaches companies, Janssen says they’re often skeptical and misinformed about what A.I and M.L. is all about. “They think that A.I. is robots doing backflips and Skynet and all this other stupid stuff. But it’s a lot more boring. It’s going in and doing a very specific task really, really well.”One of his goals, he says, is to keep all the brilliant foreign scientists now being trained at the U of A here in Edmonton. Only three of his 20 leading AltaML data scientists are Canadian born, he says. “We’re proving that if you have interesting projects and the right team, they will stay here.”Essentially, Janssen hopes to take a new Alberta strength and build on an old Alberta strength.Sounds like a plan — and one that we could use.Oil and gas won’t be here forever and neither will those computing science geniuses if we can’t employ them.dstaples@postmedia.comArticle contentShare this article in your social network         Share this Story : David Staples: Edmonton biz whiz sets out to make big bucks in artificial intelligence       Copy Link   Email   X   Reddit   Pinterest   LinkedIn   Tumblr Virginia: Big Changes Near Chantilly Leaves Drivers FumingDo not pay your auto insurance bill until you read this.Penny Pincher | SponsoredSponsoredRead MoreUndoConnor McDavid's fiancée shares wedding details but Oilers fans are talking about sunscreenEdmonton JournalUndoAfter Jack Campbell signs in Detroit, Oilers ink veteran stopper to add organizational depthEdmonton JournalUndoThese Barefoot Shoes are Leaving Neuropathy Experts BaffledBarefoot Vitality | SponsoredSponsoredBuy NowUndoChantilly: These $300/Month Senior Living Apartments Are StunningNation.com | SponsoredSponsoredLearn MoreUndoOnly Needs a Super-Light Touch to Instantly Cut Even the Toughest Toenail.Toenail Clipper | SponsoredSponsoredLearn MoreUndoThis New AC Cooler Cools the Room In SecondsSherum | SponsoredSponsoredLearn MoreUndoCommentsYou must be logged in to join the discussion or read more comments.Create an AccountSign in  Join the Conversation Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

Artificial intelligence is a creation of Human Intelligence which will surely ease our lives in future but let us understand if it can emerge as a threat to Human Intelligence?What is it?Artificial Intelligence in simple words is a part of science where machines are loaded with algorithms that let them work as humans. It is machine intelligence which comprises of Planning, Problem-solving ability along with Speech recognition and so on.Algorithms strengthen AI and provide it with the power to do reasoning and correct itself when required. It is basically a gift of human intelligence to humans. We have created intelligent machines to work on our commands. Alexa and Apple Siri are among the few examples of on-going AI machines.Will they snatch human’s opportunities?Jack Ma, the world’s richest man once said in his interview that AI will become a threat to humans. What he actually meant was, AI will snatch job opportunities from humans. The tasks that are being done today by human hands will be performed by bots in the future. Is it true? Well, we can’t predict future but one thing is certain that we have created AI for our ease and Human Intelligence is always going to be on top.There is not much to worry about as the future will reveal more and more job opportunities and humans will be having various opportunities regarding their career. Actually, these thoughts are the results of our over-expectations, we expect that one day AI will become so powerful that it will snatch our jobs and lead us to another world war. Many have started believing that AI has made quantum leaps as well. We are living in the real world and not in a fictional life like Hollywood movies.We should control our expectations. You will be shocked to hear that according to a report by Sage survey 43% of Americans don’t know what AI is? So firstly, the biggest issue is lack of awareness among a number of peoples regarding AI.It is an Autonomous Process Automation -You must have to understand that we have not created another human brain rather we have created a machine that works like a human brain. AI does the analysis, it solves the problems and it performs autonomous automation based on its experience, knowledge, and data. Don’t be negative and consider AI as a helping hand that is going to ease our lives.AI is different from humans -Alexa and Apple Siri are AIs but they are far different from us. Whatever you speak to them, they translate it to sound bites and then work on them. You will have to come out of the fictional world. These are not self-learning machines, they do what we command them to do.After regular intervals, you get an e-mail that has a new set of commands for Alexa. Hence we command them to work in our directions. You will have to understand that these are not Einstein or Hawkins, not even close to them. Human Intelligence is creative and we keep doing innovative researches. AI is just a result of our creative intelligence. AI can’t be innovative, these can’t think and neither these can become creative.What should we do?The next big question that must be revolving in your brain is what should we do? Well, just control your expectations. Einstein and Hawkins were having human brains which can think far more than any supercomputer. AIs are made to ease our lives and we should not live in threat. More than 5000 peoples work on improving Alexa, they are creating a better bot for us.We will have to come out of the fictional world that Hollywood movies have created around us. They are called machines for a purpose. You need not put a lot of stress on the word “intelligent”. You should aware of the data and information that you are sharing with them as once you have shared something it is impossible (virtually) to bring it back.Be aware and be educated.","{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://yourstory.com/mystory/is-artificial-intelligence-a-threat-to-humans-u8xioq0of2', 'url': 'https://yourstory.com/mystory/is-artificial-intelligence-a-threat-to-humans-u8xioq0of2', 'inLanguage': 'en', 'name': ' Is Artificial Intelligence a threat to Humans?', 'datePublished': '2019-03-12T08:08:35.002Z', 'dateModified': '2019-03-12T08:08:35.002Z', 'description': 'While watching sci-fi movies you must have encountered bots doing heavy tasks with great precision and you might be wondering, are we driving ourselves to this future?

When we are little, we can’t communicate very well through words and voice because we are still learning to write and speak, so drawings are a special resource to express our emotions and our relationship with the family and even other things in the world.Drawings give us a tremendous idea about children’s fears, joys, nightmares, experiences and also personalities. A drawing contains every key information about them.It’s not a definitive way to get to know the child, let’s accept it, sometimes, it means nothing, it’s just a product of getting fun but sometimes the drawing can reveal what they are feeling and thinking in that moment.Artificial Intelligence Trends To Watch This Year - Data Driven InvestorExpect a broad range of AI-enabled significant advancements in 2019. From Google searches to handling complex jobs like…www.datadriveninvestor.comDetect children’s emotions through drawingsDetecting children’s emotions through their drawings is an old technique and very used by psychology professionals.Family Drawing TestYou may have been part of these common tests made at school when you were little. Therapists use different techniques involving drawings to evaluate children’s emotions and maturity. One of the most popular is the Family Drawing Test. The Family Drawing Test gives an understanding of how the child perceives their closest relationships. It’s a simple way to understand the quality of the relationships and communication, and how children construct their reality based on family relationships.This technique has been here for over six decades. Psychiatrist Miles Porot created it in 1951 and it’s now one of the most common techniques used to evaluate the personalities of children between 5 to 16. There are other similar techniques like the Tree Test.Artificial Intelligence in Drawing techniquesAfter reading about this interesting tool, came up with this great idea of combining the old technique and Artificial Intelligence to detect different children’s emotions, extracting representative features from each category, so we can decode children’s drawings and assign an specific emotion.By far, I consider this is a great use of Artificial Intelligence. I can imagine how this AI model can help psychologists and therapists in schools. I don’t pretend this can replace the hard work done everyday, but can be of much help. A computer vision model can speed up the work and help to diagnose children.Creating a labeled datasetI couldn’t find papers or datasets about this idea to start this experiment, so I took the job to create a new dataset. I read from different sources about how to decode children’s drawings depending on the color, shapes, positions, style and other different aspects about the drawing. I’m not a psychology or therapist but found out very interesting information about these drawings and their potential.I must tell, my search for drawings on the internet was really heartbreaking and an eye-opener experience. I was shocked by seeing real children’s drawings from different websites. Most of them were part of Art Therapy programs to heal children that experimented symptoms related to Post Traumatic Stress Disorders (PTSD). Other kind of drawings I found were about child abuse and domestic violence. I also found drawings from children whose parents divorced.So after collecting a good amount of children’s drawings, the next task was to label the dataset. This is what I found on the Internet that helped me to label the dataset:Type of drawing depending the gender (shapes and colors)We can find differences between girl and boy’s drawings. It’s very true that girls prefer to use pink and soft colors while boys prefer cooler colors like blue. Also shapes vary. Girls will typically draw rounded shapes such flowers, hearts while boys will do angles, boxes, straighter lines, along with cars, buses and rockets. It’s very common they draw something representative of their gender.Let’s talk more about the colorThere’s much more behind the color they use in their drawings:Let’s start with black and purple. These colors suggest dominance and can be favored by a child who is relatively demanding. Blue is popular with children who have a caring nature and enjoy company.Red represents excitement and it’s commonly used by children that don’t want to miss out on anything.Pink, girl’s favorite color shows need for love and appreciation. Green is the color of those who enjoy being different. Mostly, for kids that are artistic and intelligent. Yellow is a happy color and demonstrates intelligence and a sunny nature.Personality depending the styleThe way children draw also reveals important information about their personality.Detailed and elaborated drawings reveal a child who feels the need to try very hard. Bold strokes, especially if close together can be a sign of stress, strong feelings, determination or anger, while soft marks express gentler nature. Quality of the line is very important, too. A figure drawn with light, wavering, broken lines, reveals a hesitant, insecure child who appears to think as he goes along. By contrast the bold, continual, freely drawn line is expressive of self-confidence, and a feeling of security. You may have heard about this one, but the absence of arms is sometimes interpreted as indicating timidity, a sign of non-aggressive children, whereas exaggerating the size of the hands is seen as symbolic of aggressive tendencies if the figure is a self-portrait. Likewise, tiny feet are seen as a sign of insecurity, literally an unstable foundation.Position of the drawingI also found on the internet that position is very important in the drawing. The left side is commonly associated with the past and with nurturing, also with mother. The right side is the opposite and is related with the future,the need to communicate and also with fathers.Sizes also matter, a child who places a drawing of a good size on the page is considered to be a well-balanced and secure, while small figures drawn at or near the lower edge of the paper, or in a corner express insecurity.What about shapes?An impulsive child may draw big figures, no necks, and asymmetry of limbs. An anxious child would do clouds, rain, flying birds, no eyes on the figures. A shy child will typically draw short figures, no nose or mouth, tiny figures and arms close to the body like hiding something behind. An angry child would do big hands and teeth, long arms and crossed eyes. An insecure child is similar to a shy one, and will draw monstrous figures, tiny head, no hands and slanted figures.Creating the classesI found it kind of hard to create categories. There are many emotions a child can express. So, what I did is to focus on 3 categories:HappinessAnxiety and DepressionAnger and ViolenceThe reason I did that it’s because a drawing can express many feelings, some feelings are similar, so I combined some of them in the same category. When I saw the drawings about the war, I saw violence, anger and sadness. Drawings about domestic violence and children experiencing parents divorce expressed anxiety and depression.So, it was easy for me to combine Anger and Violence for drawings about war, children drawing themselves with angry faces or figures expressing violence.The Anxiety and Depression class contains drawings of children with faces crying and landscapes with rain and and clouds.The happiness class was the easiest one, I found many drawings of happy families with a pet, colorful landscapes with sun, flowers and rainbows.PyTorch ModelUsed a pre-trained model and PyTorch. I split the dataset 80:20, training and validation, respectively. After some epochs and tuning the model to work well with the dataset I made, results were good, reached an accuracy of 87%!See the results below:This is a prove that Anger & Violence and Anxiety & Depression can be found in the same drawing. Sometimes, we experiment all those feelings in one situation.Sad faces, a feature associated with Anxiety and Depression classAn eye crying, feature also associated with Anxiety and Depression classWar and dramatic colors: red and orange for fire and black for bombs and explosions. Features associated with Anger and Violence classMore warWar. This drawing ma be associating colors with anxiety and Depression classWarwarHappy family and sunny day. Colorful drawing associated with Happiness classColorful drawing. Almost a 100% sure it’s in Happiness classConclusionsDrawings express more than we can imagineIt would be amazing to share this technique with some foundations. I may consider this in the future, once I get a better model and a bigger dataset.Having an efficient AI method to detect children’s emotions is a way to help psychology professionals. Let’s not forget there are more tools used all together to give a better accuracy in diagnosisI can easily see more categories but that’s a long work to do and gather more drawings for the same purposeHaving professionals to see and label the data would improve this project for sure!ReferencesLearn to code children’s drawingsLearn to decode children's drawings | Novak Djokovic FoundationLearn how to decode children's drawings and get to know your child and his inner personality better.

The Ministry of Education and Microsoft Malaysia partner to advance STEM education in Malaysia with STEM4ALL, an initiative that aims to transform the education industry in Malaysia 
It is important to equip the future workforce to adapt to technology advancements like AI. According to Microsoft’s Study on Assessing Asia Pacific’s Growth Potential Through AI, the rate of  innovation Malaysia will be doubled by 2021
As part of the Ministry’s efforts to enhance STEM education, Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka was chosen to pilot the ‘Microsoft Professional Program for Data Science Curriculum’ (MPP), making it the largest MPP curriculum to have ever been rolled out in the education world 

KUALA LUMPUR, 12 March 2019 – Ministry of Education in partnership with Microsoft (Malaysia) today launched the STEM4ALL campaign, an education initiative that aims to bring together parents, educators, students, and policymakers towards advancing STEM education for all Malaysians.
STEM4ALL aims to transform the education industry in Malaysia by promoting STEM education among Malaysians and ensuring our graduates are equipped with right skill set to drive their employability in this digital age. The campaign provides vision and direction to one of the goals under the Malaysia Education Blueprint, that is to enhance STEM education in the country.
(From L to R) YB Dr. Maszlee bin Malik, Minister of Education, Serena Zara Taufiq, CEO of Serena’s Secret, Chloe Soh Ke Er, robotics enthusiast and Dr. Jasmine Begum, Director of Legal, Corporate & Government Affairs for Microsoft Malaysia & New Markets in a panel discussion during the STEM4ALL launch, moderated by the minister himself.
The jobs of today will not be the jobs of tomorrow. Technology advancements happening all around us require the workforce to transform itself into the skilled and talented learners that the future needs and the STEM4ALL is a key campaign in the Ministry’s efforts to futureproof our workforce. The launch ceremony was graced by YB Dr. Maszlee bin Malik, Minister of Education in conjunction with Bett Asia 2019, the world’s largest education summit
The highlight at the event was not only the Minister himself but also two talented students, who had been invited to join a panel session with the Minister (image above):

Raman, Managing Director of Microsoft Malaysia added, “It is increasingly harder to imagine a job that is untouched by technology. We often hear that more than half of today’s primary school students will perform jobs that have not been invented yet. This is the reality of the digital age we live in and through the STEM4ALL campaign, we hope to shed light on how STEM education can help pave the way for future generations. We are proud to be working closely with the Ministry of Education to help make STEM education possible for all.”
Cognizant of the fact that the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) will bring forth a shift in the skills demanded in the future, Microsoft’s efforts are aligned to equip educators with technology and skills that are capable of delivering 21st century learning. Its recent study with IDC titled “Future Ready Business: Assessing Asia Pacific’s Growth Potential Through AI” analyses the impact of AI on future skills of our workforce.

“AI is undoubtedly a game-changer in this digital world,” adds Raman. “According to our study, 64% of Malaysian workforce feel that AI will augment their work. This indicates that our society is prepared to embrace AI technology and that the onus falls on organisations to do their part in preparing this future workforce, providing them with the right training to ensure that they are not left behind.”
In line with the theme for Bett Asia this year, “Building a change culture to deliver 21st century learning”, the primary objective of the STEM4ALL campaign is to build a culture of inclusivity among all Malaysians when it comes to STEM education, which in turn will help enhance the quality of STEM education in Malaysia.
“Through this campaign, we want to ensure that STEM education is ‘for all’, regardless of background or whether a student decides to pursue a non-STEM profession,” added Maszlee. “We are glad to partner with Microsoft, that has been at the forefront of technology-driven innovation and together with them, we look forward to honing our education system to embrace the shift in technology and embrace new ways of thinking about skills and training.”

Business

AI for the Caribbean





		Rachael Espinet								
	



Thursday 14 March 2019




The robot revolution is here. There is no escaping it. The world is now in the fourth wave of the industrial revolution where cloud-based computing, big data and a proliferation of sophisticated algorithms are being used to create artificial intelligence (AI) programmes that are transforming the way the world works.
Business Day met with general manager of Microsoft Caribbean Herbert Lewy, at TT Microsoft's head office on Mucurapo Road, Port of Spain, when he visited the country in February to discuss AI and the opportunities Microsoft is providing for developers.
“The definition of AI is amplifying human ingenuity. The human being is a unique species and what we are proposing is to amplify and augment this capacity,” he said.

Lewy said AI is a powerful tool that not only reshapes the way work is done but will transform human ingenuity to help workers perform more efficiently.



AI, he said, can help replace repetitive tasks that do not require human inventiveness. AI chat bots can deal with customer service issues and AI programmes can protect against fraud.
“For financial services, a bank can use it to protect a user from fraud and protect identity. AI has a very easy use of cameras and algorithms to protect the identity of the individual,” he said.
Lewy described a problem Uber, a digital ride-share taxi service, had with drivers committing fraud. Though Uber would do background checks on employees to ensure there were no sex offenders or criminals working for them, drivers could allow someone else to drive their car under their profile.
He said Uber contacted Microsoft for assistance and in less than three weeks Microsoft programmed Microsoft Azure’s Cognitive Service, AI tech which utilises speech and facial recognition, into Uber’s app to ensure the correct driver was working in the system.
“You cannot trick the system by putting a picture up of that person. You see a very simple service with investment in time and resources. You get the impact,” Lewy said.
Lewy describes AI technology as a levelling platform that can help emerging economies compete with global powerhouses.
At its annual developer conference, Build 2018, Microsoft announced AI for Accessibility program, aimed at harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to amplify human capabilities for people around the world with disabilities.
He said AI can be a great equaliser in business as all countries have access to the same technology for the same price. This, he said, can improve the quality of products and efficiencies of business.
He identified the agricultural sector as one that can greatly benefit from AI. The Dominican Republic, he said, utilised AI and saw a 14 per cent improvement in their GDP in that sector.



“In Dominican Republic there is a huge project going on where it is getting all the information on the weather, crossing the data with information of meteorological places with certain sensors. Just by understanding when it would be raining, that can save a huge number of crops,” he said.
The AI programme was able to sense the wind speed, determine if the crops would have been uprooted by the wind or how often the plants would need watering.
He said the knowledge farmers have is invaluable and cannot be replaced by AI technology, but AI can help amplify their knowledge. Lewy said the agricultural sector is one area that is more laggard in terms of developing technologies, but by utilising the AI tools available, farmers can optimise their crop yield.
During a recent interview with Business Day, Herbert Lewy, general manager of Microsoft Caribbean said the knowledge farmers have is invaluable and cannot be replaced by AI technology, but AI can help amplify their knowledge.
""We have a huge challenge as humanity needs to feed the whole world. Having access to food, that implies getting the best of farming environment and agriculture, that means just improving certain percentages of the yield would generate a huge impact in terms of populations having access to food,” he said.
After Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico in September 2017, he said the University of Columbia submitted a project to the AI for Earth Grant programme to find out how much of the ecosystem was affected in terms of biodiversity and the continuity of some species. Today the AI information is being used to detect how different plants and trees and different bio-elements are subsisting so the continuity of the species could be managed.
In fact, Lewy flew in to Trinidad to discuss the opportunity Microsoft is offering globally for organisations who want to use AI technology to improve the environment or help people with disabilities.
Developers, non-government organisations (NGOs) and people who want to do good in the world can access Microsoft's AI for Good grant programmes – AI for Earth and AI for Accessibility.
Globally, there is a US$25 million grant available for AI for Accessibility for which proposals are accepted from people who want to use Microsoft's AI technology to empower people with disabilities.



AI for Earth has a US$50 million global grant that seeks projects focusing on four pillars: agriculture, biodiversity, climate change and water. Anyone from TT is welcomed to apply for these grants.
Lewy said he is seeing AI being utilised more in the Caribbean region, and governments, business owners and workers should prepare themselves for the new tools AI.
“The opportunity is huge, the potential is fantastic, but there is a huge but. Leaders, policy makers, government officials have to take this very seriously and build the necessary framework and environment for people to succeed in this digital era with AI,” he said.
Regarding TT’s government, Lewy said there is curiosity and interest, but some Caribbean regions need to be more intense with their curiosity.
“They need to ask for more and get behind things using the power of these disruptive technologies otherwise we would be missing the trends and that is a key characteristic of this revolution.”
Sixty-five per cent of primary school students will be working in jobs that haven’t been created yet thanks to AI technology.
Lewy suggests the students who are interested in focusing on AI technology get familiar with two coding languages, Python and R. He said most importantly, a student must be proficient in mathematics.
“If you want to go deeper on algorithms you probably would have to work on R or Python. But you mostly have to be proficient in maths and statistics than in technology per say, because these systems respond in these types of way of thinking.”
While having sufficient computer science programmes in all schools is important, the rapid change technology is introducing to the work force means workers, regardless of age or job position, must re-skill themselves to adapt to the robot revolution.



“I am super positive about the future. I am also ensuring that my message is clear about re-skilling. Re-skilling does not mean you have to go from zero to be a software engineer. The thing is, many of our colleagues are reinventing themselves doing more tweaks on what they used to do to be present in digital times,” he said.
Lewy said many people are fearful of AI replacing them at their jobs, and emphasised that AI is there to help boost human ingenuity and reduce repetitive tasks.
“We encourage people to differentiate between rational questions and curiosity to emotional fear. The emotional fear will paralyse you. It won't be allowing you to make thing happen and you will just get multiple excuses why not to do things. If you go into a rational process of externalising what you are feeling, what you need, what your services are, you can overcome that, basically owning a path to success,” he said.
Microsoft offers massive open online courses (MOOCs) for free on sites such as edx.org . He also suggests that people who want to organise training sessions contact the Microsoft head office.
“There are multiple sites we put in the web for people to have access to the information. The beauty of having a local office is people can contact directly our local people. We would be more than glad to create spaces for training for people and get them much more involved in the uses of AI,” he said.
Lewy is optimistic about the future of AI in the Caribbean. He says there is no rule book to success with AI. People just have to embrace the changing technology to move forward into the future and be prepared to be life-long learners during this fourth industrial revolution.

Automation, AI seen killing more PH jobs

Advances in automation and artificial intelligence (AI) over the next decade are poised to take a brutal toll on workers, especially those engaged in manual labor and low-skilled agricultural roles.
This was according to comprehensive study released by technology giant Cisco and Oxford Economics, which forecast that at least 1.1 million jobs in the Philippines will disappear by 2028 as rapid technological innovations force workers to adapt or go unemployed.
In the Philippines, major areas of displacement are jobs in agriculture (1.2 million), wholesale/retail (880,000) and manufacturing (380,000). Overall, displaced workers will amount to 4.5 million, or over 10 percent of the workforce.

The study noted that other roles will open up as governments and companies retool the skills of their workers.FEATURED STORIES

It cited new jobs in wholesale/retail (1.3 million), transportation (490,000) and construction (460,000).
“Government needs to do more and so do citizens. Citizens also need to acknowledge that this is an investment that they are making toward lifelong learning,” Naveen Menon, Cisco president for Asean, told reporters in a recent briefing.



Menon noted, as an example, that as low-skilled agricultural roles disappear, there would be new opportunities for managers in the retail segment.



The Cisco-Oxford study was conducted across six Asean countries: Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. The goal was to build a model and quantify the impact AI-enabled technologies would have on workers through 2028.




The study noted that across the six economies, 28 million jobs would be displaced while 6.6 million roles would vanish or be considered redundant.
Menon said there was time for economies to begin preparing their workers, explaining that training for new skills could take around four years to complete.

Progress in the Philippines, however, could be slower due to unique factors such as regulatory constraints, “prolabor” policies, and the still relatively low cost of labor compared to some of its regional counterparts.
Menon said these factors could affect the Philippines’ readiness to transition to the jobs of the future.



The study also identified the top areas where skills are mismatched.
It said 41 percent across the six Asean economies lack IT skills while 10 percent lack management skills.



The shortfall is also significant when it comes to so-called soft skills.
