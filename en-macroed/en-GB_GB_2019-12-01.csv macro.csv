Frankly, I was hoping an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm would write this column for me, because who knows more about AI than the mysterious little gremlins that make “machine learning” possible? That, alas, didn’t happen; so I’m on my own.


Like most people in business, I don’t need any convincing that artificial intelligence (for most companies in many areas of their operations) will become a game-changer.

Still, it remains a fluid, if not amorphous, concept in many respects. What, exactly, can we expect AI to do for us that we’re not already doing—or how will it improve what we’re doing by doing it better, faster, cheaper, with greater insight or fewer errors?

As an important article (“Winning With AI”) in the MIT Sloan Management Review put it back in October, “AI can be revolutionary, but executives must act strategically. [And] acting strategically means deciding what not to do.” That’s not as easy as it sounds.

PROMOTED
The problem I have with most discussions of artificial intelligence is that they assume the reader or listener already understands the promises and perils of AI. But based on my conversations with a lot of very intelligent people I don’t think that’s always the case.
As Amir Husain, founder and CEO of the Austin, Texas-based machine learning company, SparkCognition, explained to Business News Daily last spring, “Artificial intelligence is kind of the second coming of software. It’s a form of software that makes decisions on its own, that’s able to act even in situations not foreseen by the programmers.”

AI is so ubiquitous we hardly even think about it. As the Business News Daily article pointed out: “Most of us interact with artificial intelligence in some form or another on a daily basis. From the mundane to the breathtaking, artificial intelligence is already disrupting virtually every business process in every industry.”

In other words, most of us are far more familiar with AI—intimately so—than we give ourselves credit for.
The business question is (as the Sloan article correctly put it): How can executives exploit the opportunities, manage the risks, and minimize the difficulties associated with AI? Put another way, how can they use it to their advantage, perhaps even in a transformative way, without turning the pursuit of AI advantage into a quixotic quest—keeping in mind that acting strategically involves “deciding what not to do” as well as pushing ahead and taking chances in some areas?
Some suggestions from the MIT Sloan Management Review article:
First: Don’t treat AI initiatives as everyday technology gambits. They’re more important than that. Run them from the C suite and closely coordinate them with other digital transformation efforts.
Second: Be sure to coordinate AI with the company’s overall business strategy. One of the surest ways to come up short—as most AI initiatives do [from 40% to 70%, according to the Sloan article]—is to focus AI narrowly on one set of priorities while the company is equally or more concerned with others. While AI can help companies reduce costs, for example, by identifying waste and inefficiencies, growing the business may be a higher priority.
The Hartford, Conn.-based insurance company, Aetna (now a subsidiary of CVS), for example, has been using AI to prevent fraud and uncover overpayments—typical insurance company concerns. It’s also been using AI to design products and increase customers and customer engagement. In one Medicare-related Aetna product, the article notes, designers used AI to customize benefits, leading to “180% growth in new member acquisition.” More long term, Aetna’s head of analytics, VP Ali Keshavarz, told the authors Aetna’s goal is to use AI to become the first place customers go when they “are thinking about their health.”  
Third: This may be obvious to the geeks among us, but perhaps less so to the more technology-challenged: Be sure to “align the production of AI with the consumption of AI.”
Fourth: “Invest in AI talent, data and process change in addition to (and often more so than) AI technology.” Recognize that every successful AI undertaking is the product of a great group of people. While some of this talent should be home grown, you’ll also have to hire from the outside: bring people in to develop and enhance your internal capabilities. That’s a fact of modern business life.
As with everything else in business, all companies are different. Their needs are different. Their available resources (financial, talent, patience) are different. And their goals and expectations should be different.
It’s important to take the time to understand how to maximize the promise and minimize the pitfalls of AI. If you do, you’re more likely to succeed.

This medical technology firm was working with the Chinese tech giant Tencent on a project to use artificial intelligence to diagnose Parkinson's Disease.This degenerative condition affects something like 10 million people worldwide. It has a whole range of symptoms and is pretty difficult to diagnose and then monitor as it progresses.Medopad's work involves monitoring patients via a smartphone app and wearable devices. It then uses a machine learning system to spot patterns in the data rather than trying to identify them by human analysis.In its offices we found one of its staff being filmed as he rapidly opened and closed his fingers - stiffness in these kind of movements is one of the symptoms of Parkinson's.As we filmed him being filmed, I stood there wondering whether I should step in front of the camera and try the same exercise. 1:53WATCH: How Rory manages Parkinson's at workFor some months, I had been dragging my right foot as I walked and experiencing a slight tremor in my right hand.Getting to gripsI had first dismissed this as just part of getting older, but had eventually gone to see my GP.She had referred me to a consultant neurologist, but at the time of filming I was still waiting for my appointment.As we left Medopad, I clenched and unclenched my fingers in the lift and reflected on what I had seen. A few days later my coverage of the project appeared on the BBC website.Three months on, in January this year, I finally met the consultant. She confirmed what I had long suspected - I was probably suffering from idiopathic Parkinson's Disease. The ""idiopathic"" means the cause is unknown.As I got to grips with the condition and started a course of medication, I quickly found out that there are all sorts of unknowns for people with Parkinson's. Why did I get it? How quickly will the various symptoms develop? What are the hopes of a cure? There are no reliable answers.My response has been to take a great interest in how the technology and pharmaceutical industries are investigating the condition. Developments in artificial intelligence, coupled with the availability of smartphones, are opening up new possibilities, and this week I returned to Medopad to see how far it had progressed. 1:28WATCH: Rory first visited Medopad in October 2018I asked the firm's chief executive, Dan Vahdat, whether he had noticed anything that suggested I might have a special interest in Parkinson's when I first visited. ""I don't think we noticed anything specifically,"" he said. ""But - and that's weird for me to tell you this - I had this intuition that I wanted to get you to do the test.""That, of course, did not happen but over the last year there has been a clinical trial involving London's King's College Hospital. People with Parkinson's have been given a smartphone app, which their relatives use to record not just that hand-clenching exercise but other aspects of the way they move.""We think this technology can help to quantify the disease,"" Dan explained. No instant impact""And if you can quantify the disease, it means you can see how the disease progresses. ""It gives you lots of opportunities, in terms of treatment adjustments, interventions at the right time, potentially screening a larger cohort of patients with the technology in ways that were not possible before.""This made me think about my own situation. Since February, I have been prescribed Sinemet - one of the most common Parkinson's drugs - in the form of two tablets taken three times a day.While some patients see an instant impact, I cannot say I notice much effect. If anything my main symptom, dragging my right foot, has got slightly worse. When I see my consultant every four months we discuss whether the prescription should be adjusted, but it is difficult for me to quantify my symptoms.Dan told me this was exactly the kind of scenario they are trying to address.""We think you will end up having a more continuous observation via machine and the doctors can look at it remotely. And with that they will be able to adjust your treatment, if needed, because potentially right now you're either overdosing or underdosing.""I am now going to get access to the trial app and look forward to finding out what it says about me.This is just one of many projects run by a variety of companies where real-time data is collected from people with Parkinson's and other conditions via their handsets. The search for a cure to Parkinson's goes on. We appear to be a long way off, but in the meantime quantifying a condition like mine could do a lot to improve how I and many others cope with the symptoms.What is exciting to me is that the smartphone revolution, which I have documented since watching Steve Jobs unveil the iPhone in 2007, now promises to change healthcare just as it has transformed many other aspects of our lives. And I hope to continue reporting on that revolution for many more years.BBC reporter urges 'openness' on Parkinson'sParkinson's diagnosis after live broadcastParkinson's AI to speed up diagnosisRory Cellan-Jones: Reporting the news with Parkinson's",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A354/production/_110021814_fcc481f8-795e-4669-b10b-d99e49c80e40.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50675702,,,,,,,

In clinics around the world, a type of artificial intelligence called deep learning is starting to supplement or replace humans in common tasks such as analyzing medical images. Already, at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, “every one of the 50,000 screening mammograms we do every year is processed through our deep learning model, and that information is provided to the radiologist,” says Constance Lehman, chief of the hospital’s breast imaging division.
In deep learning, a subset of a type of artificial intelligence called machine learning, computer models essentially teach themselves to make predictions from large sets of data. The raw power of the technology has improved dramatically in recent years, and it’s now used in everything from medical diagnostics to online shopping to autonomous vehicles.
But deep learning tools also raise worrying questions because they solve problems in ways that humans can’t always follow. If the connection between the data you feed into the model and the output it delivers is inscrutable — hidden inside a so-called black box — how can it be trusted? Among researchers, there’s a growing call to clarify how deep learning tools make decisions — and a debate over what such interpretability might demand and when it’s truly needed. The stakes are particularly high in medicine, where lives will be on the line.



Deep learning tools also raise worrying questions because they solve problems in ways that humans can’t always follow.



Still, the potential benefits are clear. In Mass General’s mammography program, for instance, the current deep learning model helps detect dense breast tissue, a risk factor for cancer. And Lehman and Regina Barzilay, a computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, have created another deep learning model to predict a woman’s risk of developing breast cancer over five years — a crucial component of planning her care. In a 2019 retrospective study of mammograms from about 40,000 women, the researchers found the deep learning system substantially outperformed the current gold-standard approach on a test set of about 4,000 of these women. Now undergoing further testing, the new model may enter routine clinical practice at the hospital.
As for the debate about whether humans can really understand deep learning systems, Barzilay sits firmly in the camp that it’s possible. She calls the black box problem “a myth.”
One part of the myth, she says, is that deep learning systems can’t explain their results. But “there are lots of methods in machine language that allow you to interpret the results,” she says. Another part of the myth, in her opinion, is that doctors have to understand how the system makes its decision in order to use it. But medicine is crammed with advanced technologies that work in ways that clinicians really don’t understand — for instance, the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that gathers the mammography data to begin with.

How Artificial Intelligence Could Help Doctors

That doesn’t answer the concerns of all physicians. Many machine learning tools are still black boxes “that render verdicts without any accompanying justification,” notes a group of physicians and researchers in a recent paper in BMJ Clinical Research. “Many think that, as a new technology, the burden of proof is on machine learning to account for its predictions,” the paper’s authors continue. “If doctors do not understand why the algorithm made a diagnosis, then why should patients trust the recommended course of treatment?”
And among computer scientists who study machine learning, “this discussion of interpretability has gone completely off the rails,” says Zachary Lipton, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University. Often, models offered for interpretability simply don’t work well, he says, and there’s confusion about what the systems actually deliver.
“We have people in the field who are able to turn the crank but don’t actually know what they’re doing,” he adds, “and don’t actually understand the foundational underpinnings of what they’re doing.”

Deep learning tools build on the concept of neural networks, originally inspired by the human brain and composed of nodes that act somewhat like brain cells. Deep learning models assemble multiple layers of these artificial neurons into a vast web of evolving connections. And the models juggle data on levels far beyond what the human mind can follow.
Understanding how the models work matters in some applications more than others. Worries about whether Amazon is offering perfect suggestions for your aunt’s birthday gift aren’t the same, for example, as worries about the trustworthiness of the tools your doctor is using to detect tumors or oncoming heart attacks.
Computer scientists are trying many approaches to make deep learning less opaque, at least to their peers. A model of breast cancer risk, for example, can use a heat map approach, letting radiologists zoom into areas of the mammography image that the model pays attention to when it makes a prediction. The model can then extract and highlight snippets of text that describe what it sees.
Deep learning models can also present images of other regions that are similar to these targeted areas, and human experts can then assess the machine’s choices. Another popular technique applies math that is more immediately understandable to subsets of the data to approximate how the deep learning model is handling the full dataset.
“We will learn more about what explanations are convincing to humans when these models are integrated into care, and we can see how the human mind can help to control and validate their predictions,” Barzilay says.
In London, a team from Moorfields Eye Hospital and DeepMind, a subsidiary of Google parent company Alphabet, also seeks to deliver explanations in depth. They have used deep learning to triage scans of patient eyes. The system takes in three-dimensional eye scans, analyzes them, and picks cases that need urgent referral — and it works as well as or better than human experts. The model gives and rates several possible explanations for each diagnosis and shows how it has labeled the parts of the patient’s eye.



“Increasingly, you wind up with people just throwing spaghetti at the wall and calling it explanations.”



As a general strategy in bringing deep learning to the clinic, “the key is to build the best system but then analyze its behavior,” says Anna Goldenberg, a senior scientist in genetics and genome biology at SickKids Research Institute in Toronto, who is partnering with clinicians to build a model that can predict cardiac arrests. “I think we want both. I think it’s achievable.”
Models like Mass General’s and Moorfields’ are well-designed, with doctor input and clinical results in peer-reviewed scientific publications, and they rest on solid technical foundations. But few attempts at interpretability will make it this far, Lipton says.
More often, such interpretations don’t show a real connection between the data that go in and what comes out. “Basically people have been looking at the pretty pictures and picking the one that looks like what they wanted to see in the first place,” Lipton adds. “Increasingly, you wind up with people just throwing spaghetti at the wall and calling it explanations.”

Even if computer scientists find a way to show how a deep learning tool works, doctors will have the final say on whether the explanations are sufficient. Doctors aren’t just interested in theoretical accuracy — they need to know the system works in the real world.
For example, when doctors are trying to spot a small tumor or early signs of an upcoming cardiac arrest, “false positives are not so problematic, because clinicians try to avoid detecting things late,” says Goldenberg. “But false negatives are a really big problem.” If the rate of false positives is too high, however, then doctors may not pay attention to the system at all.
When physicians see the clinical factors that are considered in the deep learning system, it’s easier for them to interpret the results. “Without understanding that, they’re suspicious,” Goldenberg says. “They don’t need to understand exactly how the system works or how deep learning works. They need to understand how the system would make a decision compared to them. So they will throw some cases against the system and see what it does and then see whether they trust it.”
Deep learning studies should begin by analyzing large numbers of suitable, existing medical records, experts say. In some cases, such as Goldenberg’s cardiac arrest model, she says the next step may be to run a trial where “we can let the system run, getting the real time inputs but not giving any feedback back to the clinician, and seeing the difference between the practice and what our system is predicting.”
“Before we point the finger too much at AI, we should look at all our other practices that are ripe with false positives and false negatives, and all other practices that are black boxes, based on publications that in reality few doctors read in detail,” says Isaac Kohane, a bioinformatician and physician at Harvard Medical School.

Because AI is just coming into practice, it hasn’t seen the same kind of vetting as some other technologies, Kohane adds. “And because it doesn’t look the same as a blood test or imaging test, the health care system or the regulatory authorities have not yet figured out the right way to make sure that we know it’s acceptably safe, whatever acceptably is.”
Kohane says his biggest concern is that no one really knows how well the new models work. “We should be more worried about what is a false positive rate and what is a false negative rate over time of these programs,” he adds, “so that even if they are used in black box fashion like the rest of medicine, they are sufficiently reliable.”
There is still a lot of work needed to assess the models’ performance. A 2019 study in Lancet Digital Health, which analyzed results from 69 studies on medical deep learning tools, found that the models performed as well as health care professionals. But the paper’s authors also cautioned that few of the studies pitted the models head-to-head against human experts on the same dataset.
Such studies also may miss many subtle but important issues, and they often rest on shaky assumptions, Lipton says. One major problem: A model’s accuracy is only as meaningful as the data on which it is based. “The truth is that you don’t even usually have historical data that is representative of any real-world process,” he says. “You have some kind of weird Frankenstein data that was cobbled together from a bunch of sources.”

Given deep learning’s growing power and the worries it incites, how will medical gatekeepers view the technology?
“The black box story gets a lot of emphasis,” says Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California. “The question is, will we hold machines hostage to being explainable before they can be used in medicine? I don’t know the answer.”
If prospective trials validate these models, he says, there’s every reason to bring them forward to the clinic with the hope of achieving a happy symbiosis between doctors and machines — even if doctors have no idea why the models work.
“But whenever you lean on machines there’s a pushback, because doctors are used to controlling everything,” Topol says. “When you say: ‘The machine can do this as well as you, or potentially even better,’ there’s a bias against that. Overwhelming proof is one way to deal with that negative bias.”
Descriptions of the issue can carry their own bias. “The term ‘black box’ in itself has a bit of a negative turn,” says Lehman of Mass General. “We don’t know what’s there and we want to fill it with information. But I think the term is unfortunate.” While clinicians may not understand how the tools make every decision, she adds, if they can prove the tools work, “that itself can teach us new explanations. We just have to think differently.”



“Whenever you lean on machines there’s a pushback, because doctors are used to controlling everything.”



Today’s medicine abandons vast amounts of data in electronic health records, test tubes, and X-ray machines, Lehman points out. “If we can start to pull out that rich data and be more predictive for who is going to live and who’s going to die, who’s going to need this intervention and who needs that test,” she adds, “we can completely change the entire paradigm of health care.”
The effects will be most profound for people with little or no direct access to doctors, says Peter Thomas, director of digital innovation at Moorfields Eye Hospital. And Moorfields’ eye diagnostic tools, he adds, may help doctors focus on patients who most need their help.
Advocates see adoption coming, and soon. In tasks like analyzing mammograms at Mass General, “deep learning systems are already better than humans,” says Barzilay. “Way better than humans.”
“Our current models are really complex and they can capture visual patterns which are so subtle that the human eye may not be able to understand them,” she adds. “Does it really mean that we shouldn’t be benefiting from them because our visual capacity is limited?”
Once deep learning systems clearly demonstrate how well they work, “I don’t think that the interpretability will be an issue,” Barzilay says. “Many other reasons may prevent adoption, but the black box aspect will not be the main one.”

Artificial Intelligence refers to the theory of computer systems or human-made robots programmed with performing tasks as humans, such as learning, generalization, and reasoning. With this ability, AI has become a significant part of human lives. Similarly, AI and the education & tutoring web solutions are inseparable from being observed by the astounding inventions enabling machines to mimic human roles.

The most notable transitions can realize in the form of infusing more personalization and convenience in the academic world. Currently, AI holds a dominant power in the education industry, and the artificial intelligence solution providers are progressive in fuelling the AI development engine for the future.

According to a report, US education is forecasted to experience 48% growth in the artificial intelligence market by the year 2022. With such growth, AI solution providers will be able to provide integrated education and tutoring web solutions worldwide.

How AI will Shape the Future of the Education Industry
A new educational system will be the outcome of excessive integration of artificial intelligence, catering to student needs, and wants. Automation will be the most significant part of such a system. 

Here is a list for getting a better understanding of how the education industry's future can transform through artificial intelligence.

1. AI-powered personalization

AI systems can develop a learning profile of every student based on customization. This customization can module training materials for every student considering their experience, ability, and preferable learning mode. Personalization is necessary for the education industry since teaching for all students should not be the same when learning among them is highly distinct.

2. Automation of basic educational activities

Certain activities such as testing and grading have become tedious and time-consuming work for the teachers. Absolute replacement of human grading is impossible for AI, but it can reach pretty much close. AI-enabled grading is convenient for «fill in the blanks and multiple-choice tests,» but it seems complicated for writing tests. 

However, AI solutions are progressively researching and finding solutions to this drawback. This transformation can assist the teachers by saving a significant amount of time and invest it in a better place.

3. Connecting students with global classrooms



Technology means connecting with the world. Artificial intelligence solution providers have the opportunity to take advantage of supportive technological advancements for developing tools. These tools can enable the students to become a part of global classrooms wherein education is provided in a way understandable by all kinds of students.

4. AI-based tutors



Human Intelligence tutors can offer more things that an AI tutor can't. At current times, the AI tutors are programmed to teach basic writing, mathematics, and other subjects. But the AI solution providers are investing head-to-foot efforts for developing tutors that can completely replace human tutors.
 
Advanced tutoring systems are in the pipeline for the AI solution providers that enable with facilitating what the real-world requires, such as higher-level creativity and thinking. Students will avail support even from outside the classroom that constitutes the best part of AI tutors.

5. Sourcing of real-time feedback

Apart from customized training materials, the AI-driven programs are capable of offering real-time feedback by analyzing the students' performance accurately. The students and teachers get feedback when results are declared. Currently, the US schools have adopted an online dashboard using which the teachers can keep their eye on student performance. 

AI-driven Education Applications
With the educational applications empowered by AI, the students receive harness power for learning improvement. AI targets learning improvement among the students from primary school to college or university. Also, it exhibits excellent avenues and empowerment for teachers and learners to arrive at their educational goals.

The forecasting report identified that the AI-driven e-learning tools will experience a vast market size of US$ 6 billion by the end of 2024. Let's gain an understanding of what AI-enabled educational applications have emerged yet.

MATHiaU: This application was designed for the students feeling bored or lost in their lecture-sized classrooms. Developing by Carnegie Learning, this application undertakes multi-tasking, including a unique learning process for students, notifying about everyday progress, and developing tailor-made lessons considering students' needs and struggles.

Brainly: Brainly offers students an open platform where they can place their homework-related queries, and in return, fellow students provide them with verified and automated answers. It takes help from machine learning algorithms for filtering spam. It makes students independent for finding their solutions by establishing collaboration with other students.

Netex Learning: Tags as an easy-to-use platform, Netex Learning enables teachers to develop and integrate curriculum and to design tailor-made content for students capable of getting published in countless digital platforms. Teachers are allowed to monitor and track student's progress in visual representation by using tools such as digital discussions, learning analytics and video conferencing, and so on.

Thinkster Math: Thinkster Math is an ideal combination of a personalized style of teaching and a real math curriculum. With the assistance of machine learning and artificial intelligence, this tutor app creates a visualization for the tutor of student thinking while solving a problem. It enables the tutor to identify the point in no time where the student got trapped.

Risks of Artificial Intelligence in the Education Industry
No technology comes without the adverse effects irrespective of industrial type. Although artificial intelligence is indeed creating a buzz in the education industry by improved and efficient learning and teaching tools, it should not ignore how disruptions can create by this technological advancement.


The incurrence of high power cost
Stimulation in unemployment
Quality compromise
Absence of personal engagement and interaction
Broadening the gap of rich-poor
The unclear learning ability of children from a virtual assistant
Boosting the technology addiction of students

To Sum Up
It is difficult to judge the efficiency of artificial intelligence services in the education industry due to its pros and cons. AI software and applications will remove certain limitations for the students in accessing education. Their impact will soon be visible from the lower-level to higher-level institutions.CloseTags:artificial intelligenceeducationmachine learningHubs:Machine learningArtificial Intelligence",,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://habr.com/en/articles/478736/'}",,"['h_machine_learning', 'h_artificial_intelligence', 'f_develop', 'f_popsci']",,,,,

Case Western Reserve researchers use AI with routine CT scans to predict how well lung cancer patients will respond to expensive treatment based off changes in texture patterns inside and outside the tumor
Scientists from the Case Western Reserve University digital imaging lab, already pioneering the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to predict whether chemotherapy will be successful, can now determine which lung-cancer patients will benefit from expensive immunotherapy.
And, once again, they’re doing it by teaching a computer to find previously unseen changes in patterns in CT scans taken when the lung cancer is first diagnosed compared to scans taken after the first two to three cycles of immunotherapy treatment. And, as with previous work, those changes have been discovered both inside—and outside—the tumor, a signature of the lab’s recent research.
“This is no flash in the pan—this research really seems to be reflecting something about the very biology of the disease, about which is the more aggressive phenotype, and that’s information oncologists do not currently have,” said Anant Madabhushi, whose Center for Computational Imaging and Personalized Diagnostics (CCIPD) has become a global leader in the detection, diagnosis and characterization of various cancers and other diseases by meshing medical imaging, machine learning and AI.
Currently, only about 20% of all cancer patients will actually benefit from immunotherapy, a treatment that differs from chemotherapy in that it uses drugs to help your immune system fight cancer, while chemotherapy uses drugs to directly kill cancer cells, according to the National Cancer Institute.
Madabhushi said
the recent work by his lab would help oncologists know which patients would
actually benefit from the therapy, and who would not.
“Even though
immunotherapy has changed the entire ecosystem of cancer, it also remains extremely
expensive—about $200,000 per patient, per year,” Madabhushi said. “That’s part
of the financial toxicity that comes along with cancer and results in about 42%
of all new diagnosed cancer patients losing their life savings within a year of
diagnosis.”
Having a tool based on the research being done now by his lab would go a long way toward “doing a better job of matching up which patients will respond to immunotherapy instead of throwing $800,000 down the drain,” he added, referencing the four patients out of five who will not benefit, multiplied by annual estimated cost.
New research published ﻿

The figure above shows differences in CT radiomic patterns before and after initiation of checkpoint inhibitor therapy. 
The new research, led by co-authors Mohammadhadi Khorrami and Prateek Prasanna,  along with Madabhushi and 10 other collaborators from six different institutions was published in November in the journal Cancer Immunology Research. 
Khorrami, a
graduate student working at the CCIPD, said one of the more significant
advances in the research was the ability of the computer program to note the
changes in texture, volume and shape of a given lesion, not just its size.
“This is important
because when a doctor decides based on CT images alone whether a patient has responded
to therapy, it is often based on the size of the lesion,” Khorrami said. “We
have found that textural change is a better predictor of whether the therapy is
working. 
“Sometimes, for
example, the nodule may appear larger after therapy because of another reason,
say a broken vessel inside the tumor—but the therapy is actually working. Now,
we have a way of knowing that.” 
Prasanna, a
postdoctoral research associate in Madabhushi’s lab, said the study also showed
that the results were consistent across scans of patients treated at two different
sites and with three different types of immunotherapy agents.
“This is a
demonstration of the fundamental value of the program, that our machine-learning
model could predict response in patients treated with different immune
checkpoint inhibitors,” he said. “We are dealing with a fundamental biological principal.”
Prasanna said the initial study used CT scans from 50 patients to train the computer and create a mathematical algorithm to identify the changes in the lesion. He said the next step will be to test the program on cases obtained from other sites and across different immunotherapy agents. This research recently won an ASCO 2019 Conquer Cancer Foundation Merit Award.
Additionally,
Madabhushi said, researchers were able show that the patterns on the CT scans which
were most associated with a positive response to treatment and with overall patient
survival were also later found to be closely associated with the arrangement of
immune cells on the original diagnostic biopsies of those patients.
This suggests that
those CT scans actually appear to capturing the immune response elicited by the
tumors against the invasion of the cancer—and that the ones with the strongest
immune response were showing the most significant textural change and most
importantly, would best respond to the immunotherapy, he said.
Madabhushi established
the CCIPD at Case Western Reserve in 2012. The lab now includes nearly 60
researchers. 
Some of the lab’s most recent work,
in collaboration with New York University and Yale University, has used AI to
predict which lung cancer patients would benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy
based on tissue-slide images. That advancement was named by Prevention Magazine as one of the top 10 medical breakthroughs of
2018.

Before joining Vox, she worked for TheStreet.FacebookLinkTo find out how 2020 Democratic candidates would use their presidential powers to address different aspects of technology, we sent seven key questions to every campaign. This post includes six candidates’ answers to the fifth question. You can find answers to the other six questions on the landing page. How, if at all, should tech companies be held responsible for the jobs they eliminate with their innovations?Bernie Sanders: [I] will tell corporate America that artificial intelligence and robotics are not going to be used just to throw workers out on the street. This exploding technology must serve human needs, not just corporate profits. As president, [I] will require firms to convey shares to workers who are laid off due to offshoring or automation.[I] will work to prevent workers from being displaced by automation in the first place. We will end tax breaks that encourage companies to replace American workers with robots. Trump’s recent tax bill expanded one of those tax breaks; we are going to close it.[My] Corporate Accountability and Democracy plan would mandate that corporations with more than $100 million in revenue appoint workers to 45 percent of their board seats and issue 20 percent of the corporation’s stock to a worker-controlled fund. When workers have an ownership stake in their company and a say in the decisions that are made, they will not automate their own jobs to increase profits. When workers have more say in their workplace, they will be better able to balance increased productivity and work-saving technology and the interests of the workers that may be replaced. But whether it is coal miners transitioning to jobs in a clean energy economy or manufacturing workers displaced by corporate greed and automation, [I] will protect workers and the communities in which they live. We will create a sustainable future for all and good-paying union jobs right here in America. We will ensure workers in transition have the opportunities, benefits, and supports they need to thrive. Job guarantees, job training, housing, pensions, health care, and more. No one will be left behind. We will pass a federal jobs guarantee to ensure that those who work in industries likely to see major impacts of automation or innovation are able to work elsewhere. [I] will make public colleges, universities, and trade schools tuition-free to ensure all are able to get a higher education if they choose to pursue it. [My] Green New Deal will create 20 million jobs needed to save the planet. We will address the shortage of teachers and caregivers in this country. There is plenty of work to be done. We will ensure that work is done and that people are paid well to do it.Elizabeth Warren: We need to pass my Accountable Capitalism Act. Among other things, it will require large companies to let workers elect board members. This will give workers more control over corporate decisions, including on introducing new technology and how affected workers are compensated.I’ve also introduced a wealth tax on giant fortunes of more than $50 million to bring in the revenue we need to give every kid an opportunity to build a future by investing in universal child care, public education, universal free college, and student debt cancellation for 42 million Americans. I’ve introduced a Real Corporate Profits tax on the profits very large American companies report to their investors with no loopholes or exemptions. It will make our biggest and most profitable corporations pay more so they don’t get away with paying $0 in taxes ever again. We’ll use this money to invest in green research, manufacturing, and exporting — linking American innovation directly to American jobs. Pete Buttigieg: Despite the fact that innovation has driven roughly half of all economic growth since World War II, new technologies that create new jobs can also disrupt or destroy old ones. As technological innovation continues to accelerate, the impacts may be broader and swifter than at other points in history. As a result, we must proactively adopt policies that not only ensure that America leads in the creation of new jobs and industries but that also make sure change works for all of us — not just a few.First, because what you learn is often associated with what you can earn, we need to make sure that every student can develop basic digital and lifelong skills that are increasingly necessary for the new jobs of the future. That is why my Internet for All plan will ensure that every child — regardless of where they live or how much their parents make — can take full advantage of digital learning opportunities. And that’s why I will invest $500 billion to make college affordable for working and middle-class families.Second, we need to ensure that there are appropriate safety nets in place for those whose jobs are disrupted by innovation, so that they can continue to lead productive and fulfilling lives. As technological transformations shift the nature of our job market, we must be able to provide adequate support and retraining to workers to ensure that American workers work in good jobs and earn a fair day’s wage for a fair day’s work. That is why my economic plan invests $50 billion in workforce training and lifelong learning — investing federal dollars into eight key programs so that incomes can grow for all workers, whether or not they have a college degree.Third, when people do get jobs in the tech industry, companies must treat them fairly and be responsible for the workers they hire. I have proposed a bold agenda to tackle this problem, titled A New Rising Tide, which guarantees gig workers the right to unionize through codifying the “ABC” test, and cracks down on companies that misclassify workers as independent contractors. Tech companies should be partners in these policies, not barriers to them.Andrew Yang: [I] frequently talk about the Fourth Industrial Revolution — the greatest technological and economic shift of all time. A driving force behind that is the automation of jobs. As we undergo this transition, we need to ensure that Americans get a slice of every Amazon transaction, Facebook ad, Google search, and self-driving truck mile. By implementing a [value-added tax] at half the European rate and making these companies pay their fair share, we can implement a Freedom Dividend of $1,000 per month for all American adults to help them transition through this difficult time. Tom Steyer: The American economy should reward innovation, ingenuity, and productivity. If our country, however, wants to generate sustained economic growth, we also have to provide opportunity, and ensure the health and welfare of the American worker. That means guaranteeing every American an education and a livable wage. It means providing workers with better and lower-cost health care, clean air and water, and retirement security. It also means that we are going to make a federal tax system that is more equitable, so Americans can fulfill their potential and live in dignity. Michael Bennet: Companies have a responsibility to consider how their innovations will affect the workforce and society more broadly, and wherever possible, invest in training existing and future employees for jobs that will be available well into the future. At the same time, government needs to develop sensible, forward-thinking policy to harness innovations so that they lead to more jobs with better wages and working conditions, rather than fewer jobs with worse pay and conditions. At a minimum, government should invest far more in K-12 education, proven apprenticeships, community college, and other opportunities to gain the skills for good-paying jobs in the modern economy.You’ve read 1 article in the last monthHere at Vox, we believe in helping everyone understand our complicated world, so that we can all help to shape it.

The technology is based on two decades of research by  Maryellen Giger, PhD, Professor of Radiology and a world-renowned pioneer in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD).
Each year, TIME lists 100 groundbreaking inventions that &ldquo;are changing the way we live, work, play and think about what&rsquo;s possible.&rdquo; Nominations are evaluated based on factors such as &ldquo;originality, creativity, influence, ambition and effectiveness.&rdquo;
QuantX analyzes breast magnetic resonance images (MRIs) using artificial intelligence and a large reference data base to help radiologists interpret medical images in the assessment of cancerous and non-cancerous breast lesions. The FDA cleared the new technology in 2017 after a clinical study showed QuantX improved the detection of cancerous breast tumors by 39%, and increased overall diagnostic improvement by 20%.
Giger's lab specializes in gleaning information from medical images by developing novel computer vision algorithms, thus allowing AI to augment radiologists&rsquo; interpretations. &ldquo;This type of technology, together with radiologists, will clearly lead to improved outcomes for patients and efficiency,&rdquo; said Aytekin Oto, MD, MBA, interim chair of radiology at UChicago Medicine.
Oto noted the Department of Radiology&rsquo;s unique structure, which brings MDs and PhDs together under one academic department, fosters the research and innovation needed to bring new technology to the bedside.
The breast radiology team at UChicago Medicine is now evaluating QuantX and considering it for future patient use, as is a team at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Similar AI-enabled software could eventually be developed for use in diagnosing prostate, lung, and other types of cancers.
Translation of Giger's National Cancer Institute-funded research was further made possible through collaboration with the Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation at the University of Chicago. Giger is the co-founder of Quantitative Insights, Inc., which produced QuantX and placed as a finalist among more than 100 competitors in the Polsky Center&rsquo;s 2009-2010 New Venture Challenge. Her lab&rsquo;s research was commercialized as QuantX within the UChicago startup Quantitative Insights, which was incubated at the Polsky Center, until the assets were sold in 2019 to Paragon Biosciences. A subsidiary, Qlarity Imaging, is commercializing QuantX.

We’ve got a special insight for you in this week’s Daily Cut mailbag…
Tech expert Jeff Brown tells us how to get a starting salary of $300-$500K a year with little to no experience. It’s some of the best guidance we’ve had all year.
And even if you’re already retired, it’s great advice for your kids and grandkids.
So let’s get right to it…
And make sure you stick around for our other great insights on where uranium prices are headed… what’s changing the natural financial cycle… and who’s behind the conspiracy against cannabis…


Reader question: Jeff, I am wondering if you have advice for someone wanting to explore the AI/ML [artificial intelligence/machine learning] field. I have been interested in pursuing education down this road to make a career change. I read your Bleeding Edge and Near Future Report, and I feel, as you do, that this is an industry with serious growth prospects.
What would be the best approach for this? Most colleges do not have majors focused on it, and they are exceedingly expensive. I have read you mention Udacity before, and I am curious if that is the best approach.

– Michael H. (Legacy Research member)
Jeff’s answer: First off, thanks for being a reader. This has been a popular question in our mailbag in the past. And I’m always happy to answer questions from readers looking to continue, or even begin, their education in the field of high technology.
And I can tell you that if you are able to develop the skills for this field, you will absolutely have work. I’ve shared the below chart before. But it perfectly illustrates this.


Simply put, AI will be the hottest area for jobs over the next 20 years.
The field is so hot that AI specialists with little to no industry experience can expect to make between $300-$500K per year (in salary and stock), on average.
And as you can see, there are about 2.9 times more job openings than there are applicants to fill those positions. It’s a job-seeker’s market.
Udacity is certainly one place you could start to seek out additional training. For readers who don’t know, Udacity is a company that offers “nanodegrees.” We can think of these as highly specialized certifications for very specific techniques. This could become something that we do on a frequent basis – perhaps earning a nanodegree every few years.
Udacity offers nanodegrees in everything from AI programming… deep-learning technology… and natural language processing. It also offers an “Intro to Machine Learning” course. These courses typically cost anywhere between $450 to $1,300.
And if you’re looking for free resources to continue learning, I’d recommend you look at edX (www.edX.org). A lot of the content is free, and edX is backed by MIT, one of the hot spots for AI/ML.
Coursera is another site for online learning, and there are several AI/ML courses from famous professors at Stanford available (www.coursera.org/stanford).
And in the event that you might want to earn a full degree, AI/ML specializations can be earned within the computer science school of major universities. The prerequisite to taking specialized courses is computer programming skills, which can be learned in a university program, or in specialized programming boot camps like Flatiron School, Hack Reactor, Fullstack Academy, or General Assembly.

Next up… Nick Giambruno and Dave Forest team up to tackle a Cut reader’s question about uranium prices.


Reader question: For Nick and/or Dave.
Hello – much is being talked about gold, but I’d appreciate your thoughts on uranium prices.
Much has been said about the supply shortage and inevitable spike in prices. What is the status on this?
Could you please provide your thoughts on uranium and when we should expect uranium prices to spike, and provide the significant gains you predict? Thanks.

– Jose P. (Legacy Research member)
Nick’s answer: Nuclear power delivers immense value to its users, there’s no substitute for uranium, and production is falling while demand rises.
This situation only has two possible outcomes:


Uranium prices don’t go up. Miners have no incentive to produce. Nuclear power plants run out of uranium, and the lights go out for billions of people.


Uranium prices go up and incentivize enough production to meet the demand.


There are no other options.
Uranium is a “when, not if” situation. Of course, the big question is when. The truth is… nobody knows for sure.
That’s the thing about speculations… they work on their own schedule.
I am confident that uranium will reward patient speculators. In fact, just this week I added to my own personal positions in uranium.
Dave’s answer: The fundamental setup for uranium is excellent. Current spot prices are WAY below the costs of production for most uranium mines. It’s so bad, many companies have stopped mining because it’s cheaper to buy other people’s uranium on the spot market to fulfill long-term contracts.
You can guess that’s not sustainable for long. Eventually, there will be no more spot supply. Then, we’ll need prices to rise so mines can reopen.
How long will that take? Hard to say. Uranium stockpiles are notoriously hard to estimate, because you’re dealing with opaque countries like Russia and Kazakhstan. But it will happen.
One note on timing: Right now, uranium is the most crowded “contrarian” play I’ve ever seen. There are lots of investors who love the sector, very vocally. To me, that suggests we’re not quite at a turning point. When all those bulls give up (many of them have been waiting years by now), we’ll be close.

Now, let’s shift our focus to “funny money”…
Faithful fans (and haters) of Bill Bonner will know what we mean by “funny” or “fake” money. But if that’s a new term to you, don’t worry… There’s an easy explanation…
All the dollars, euros, pesos, rubles, and other national currencies are “fake” because they’re no longer backed by gold or anything with actual value… They’re backed only by government promises. So that means they’re no longer real money.
Now, if you want to know how all that happened, here are two great essays from Bill:
Executive Order 6102 Led to the Fall of America’s Money System
The Extinction of the Fiscal Conservative
But for today’s mailbag, the short explanation is enough to set the stage for our next question… And Jeff Clark steps up with the answer.


Reader question: I have a question regarding the markets from your perspective. With all the new funny money coming in, can you still trust your go-to indicators?
What does this money from nowhere do to the markets?
I am aware that the funny money has been coming in for a long time. I guess my real question is… In all the years you have been watching the market, has its natural cycle changed as a result of this funny money?

– David S. (Legacy Research member)
Jeff’s answer: Hi David. Thanks for the question. The simple answer is: Yes, the natural financial cycles have changed as a result of “funny money.”
Remember, though, market cycles are always evolving and adjusting. The typical patterns that worked yesterday may not work tomorrow. That’s why technical analysis is more of an art than a science.
Naturally, the more money that is available, the more likely that money will find a home in stocks and will keep bullish trends intact longer. Perhaps that’s why our stock market is enjoying the longest bull run in history.
For my purposes, though, funny money really doesn’t impact the short-term activity – which is based more on market psychology. Stocks are still likely to pull back from overbought conditions. And they’re still likely to rally off of oversold conditions. And, most of the indicators I’ve been using for years to identify overbought and oversold conditions are – for the most part – still quite reliable.

For our last question and answer of the week, we turn to the most controversial topic in The Daily Cut this week – CBD.
Teeka Tiwari provides the answer…


Reader question: Hi Chris [Lowe]. It’s Andrea, the one from the conference… When they served tea and cakes, and you said, “What is this?”… I said, “It’s sugar.” You responded, “That’s a high-level answer.” You probably don’t remember.
Anyway… anyone that has read Doug Casey’s books already knows how corrupt the FDA is and how it accomplishes its dirty work. That part of Doug’s book [Right on the Money] ain’t no fiction.
I am thinking it’s the alcohol, tobacco, and mainly pharmaceutical companies who are paying the FDA to propagate these lies about cannabis… What do you think?
I’m a lifetime Legacy member… that’s if you stay interesting and entertaining enough.

– Andrea L. (Legacy Research member)
Teeka’s answer: Big Pharma isn’t the only one targeting cannabis, either. Dozens of politicians and insiders have publicly attacked cannabis, too…
Yet they’re now investing in it – in record numbers. And that’s why I recently sat down with one of President Trump’s close friends, Fox News host Judge Jeanine Pirro, to expose them.
What we discussed could make you uncomfortable… perhaps even angry. But it could also make you more money than you’ve ever dreamed possible.

That’s all for this week.
But if you’d like to watch Teeka’s full interview with Judge Pirro, you can catch it here.

P.S. If you didn’t read yesterday’s Daily Cut, you missed the No. 1 piece of investing advice from Larry Benedict, the former hedge fund manager whose firm made $95 million during the worst part of the 2008 global financial crisis. So catch up on that here before you start your weekend.
And if you prefer watching over reading, Larry just released the first three in a series of short, documentary-style videos. They take you behind the scenes of his day-to-day life as a top trader. Secure your access here with one click.

Christian Reyes, 18, with a budding interest in electronics, said neither he nor his Mexican-born parents ever imagined he would veer towards manufacturing. On the recommendation of a high school teacher, Reyes took an internship at Felsomat in 2014 during his senior year. Felsomat hired Reyes after graduation and he is now working toward a three-year degree in manufacturing at Harper College, a community college that resuscitated a dormant manufacturing course in 2012 at the urging of local companies. The future of manufacturing in the U.S. will largely be shaped by the strength of the U.S. dollar, energy costs and the outcome of trade deals such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

Neural networks trained on real-world examples churn out results that are as close as possible to those original examples. In this case, it seems like the algorithm found a shortcut.Futurism reviewed at least five résumés generated by the website, each of which provided an email address for their fictional subject that turned out to be registered in real life.Futurism also found that the résumés provided the links to real Facebook and Instagram accounts, suggesting that the résumés generator might be simply reproducing real people's names and contact information. By press time, none of those people have responded to Futurism's request for a comment, so the résumé with an active Facebook link has been excluded from this article.The headshots provided on some résumés, however, are randomized and generated by a similar website that uses AI to generate fake photos, according to an FAQ section on the résumé site.Shallow PoolAside from reproducing contact information, the AI-generated résumés don't always paint applicants in the best light. The job descriptions highlight AI's ongoing struggle to recognize context and the actual meaning of words.For example, a résumé for a fictional person named Darren Charles boasts that ""…I am activities and learn new things and I do noticity."" Another résumé's summary reads ""I am a passionate software developer who loves to preparo many talent"" and says that the person spends over a quarter of their time ""getting too little sleep.""If this algorithm's HR skills are any indication, it looks like the job search and hiring process will still need a human touch.More on AI-generated media: This Site Uses Deep Learning to Generate Fake Airbnb ListingsShare This ArticleRead This NextSorting HatMcDonald’s Making Job Applicants Take Weird AI Personality TestsFuturismWas That Script Written By A Human Or An AI?
