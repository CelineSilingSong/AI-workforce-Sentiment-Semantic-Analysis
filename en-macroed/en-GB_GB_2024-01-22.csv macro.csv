When any major new technology grabs the headlines, talk quickly turns to jobs. And so it is with generative AI. How will generative AI affect jobs? What’s the potential scale of job displacement? I’ve written extensively on this subject, but what I’d really like to emphasize in this article is the potential for generative AI to create entirely new jobs.


Rather than replace human workers, generative AI is going to create a new need for skilled workers – professionals with the ability to manage and get the best out of generative AI. What might those jobs look like? Here’s a list of emerging roles related to generative AI.

AI Prompt Engineer
Prompt engineers are experts at getting generative AI applications like ChatGPT to deliver a specific output. (For example, a generic prompt will elicit a generic response, so a prompt engineer will refine their prompts until they get the desired result.) As such, rather than being experts in programming, prompt engineers need strong communication skills, attention to detail, critical thinking, and data skills (in terms of working out what info the AI needs).

PROMOTED
Generative Design Specialist
A bit like a prompt engineer but focusing on design outputs, this role will become increasingly popular across fields like architecture, product design, and engineering. In a nutshell, because generative AI can be used to create almost limitless design variations, experts will be needed to guide the AI and interpret its outputs to achieve optimal designs.

AI Input And Output Manager
Think of this role as the next level up from a prompt engineer – a more strategic role that oversees the information being uploaded to generative AI systems and the outputs that AI systems deliver. This will become increasingly important as companies grapple with considerations around data privacy, copyright, AI explainability, and AI bias.

AI Content Reviewer/Content Auditor
Across all forms of content – such as written articles, visual designs, and analysis reports – human reviewers will be needed to assess the quality, accuracy, and appropriateness of content. So, while we will undoubtedly see generative AI being used to create more and more content, we still need humans to ensure that content is fit for purpose.

AI Trainer
These are professionals who specialize in “teaching” and refining AI models. Their tasks can range from feeding the AI data, to fine-tuning its outputs to ensure accuracy and relevance.

AI Maintenance Engineer
Like any system, AI models require upkeep in terms of updating models, ensuring systems run efficiently, and troubleshooting issues. Generative AI is no different.
AI Security Specialist
The cybersecurity landscape is becoming a whole lot more complicated thanks to AI, with the technology enabling more sophisticated phishing attacks, malware, and more. Organizations will therefore need experts who can defend systems against the malicious use of AI – and potentially harness AI to mitigate threats.
AI Instructor/AI Literacy Educator
Just as computer literacy became a fundamental skill in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, AI literacy will become crucial going forward. Instructors who can teach individuals about AI’s workings, benefits, and challenges are emerging.
AI Ethicist/AI Ethics Officer
Given the powerful capabilities of GenAI, there’s a clear need for professionals who can ensure that these systems are developed and used ethically, without biases, and in ways that are socially responsible. So, part of an AI ethicist’s remit will be to create and implement guidelines that govern an organization’s ethical, safe use of AI systems.
AI Compliance Manager/AI Compliance Officer
If an ethicist’s role is about shaping the ethical use of AI, the compliance manager’s role is to ensure those guidelines are properly followed. Plus, as regulation and scrutiny around AI increases, organizations will need dedicated compliance professionals to ensure the business is acting within legal frameworks.
AI Personality Designer
As more and more generative AI tools emerge, it makes sense that these tools will need their own unique “personalities” to differentiate them from the competition. As such, we could see a new role emerge dedicated to creating engaging, likable personalities for generative AI entities. This will make interactions with generative AI tools feel more human-like.
Custom AI Solution Developer
While many AI applications might be broad, there’s a growing market for custom, niche AI solutions tailored to specific industry needs or challenges. Indeed, this is already happening, with many organizations partnering with AI companies to create their own bespoke, internal models built on publicly available models.
The Final Takeaway
As generative AI continues to evolve, new job roles will emerge that center around guiding, refining, and interpreting AI – not to mention integrating its capabilities into various sectors. That’s not to downplay the fact that many jobs will be altered or made obsolete by generative AI. But rather than focusing on generative AI solely as a job disruptor, we should also recognize it as a job creator.

There is a bit of impatience in the higher education sector to “do something” about generative AI.
In the last year, academics and leaders have been exhorted to bolster academic integrity in the face of new AI tools, prevent misconduct, integrate AI into the curriculum, and ensure assessments are AI-proof – while simultaneously implementing measures to reorient their courses and curricula to exploit the many advantages generative AI offers.
The positive potential of generative AI is, of course, the same potential that directly links to concerns about assessment integrity – AI authored essays, code snippets and software, graphics, audio, posters, and video.
As engineering educators, we are instinctively inclined to welcome new technology tools and to be progressive in assessment formats. The engineering curriculum offers a wealth of opportunity for innovative and authentic assessment formats including designs, portfolios, test reports, specifications, code, and business cases as well as traditional exams and the occasional essay.
However, at this genesis of accessible and widespread generative AI, we lack authority, governance, and visibility of these tools to understand how they work. It is with this in mind that we urge special caution in the integration of generative AI, specifically in two main areas: creative work (which includes engineering), and work-based learning.
The question of creativity
In creative work, we ask students to innovate through objects, designs, written works; it is one of the most fulfilling and rewarding activities of learning and assessment, and used well it can evidence high levels of competence and achievement due to the inherent recognition of the steps taken along the creative journey to produce the end artefact.
When directed through generative AI, the work becomes embellished by the public corpus of work that the AI model has learnt from. This raises questions. Firstly, to what extent is generative AI truly inspiring and developing a learner’s creative skill, if self-formulated ideas are being filtered, and possibly diluted, with the consensus of public work held by the model.
At present these tools offer no transparency into the process they follow and how they reach the conclusions they present, effectively degrading the learner’s creative journey to a series of keyboard taps and a few strategic clicks.
Secondly, at the point at which work is loaded through generative AI, this now forms a part of the public corpus that the model derives its learning from – raising the question of who now owns the intellectual property and any further iteration of that work.
There might be further ramifications of using AI-enabled assessments particularly with regards to fairness and inherent biases. Since these AI tools have been trained on public corpus, they assimilate underlying biases, including but not limited to racial, gender and other forms of discriminatory text which can then trickle into grading and assessments.
Confidential matters
In engineering, the workplace is a powerful and frequently integral part of the learning experience, whether through an apprenticeship, an industrial placement year or industrially located project. Here, at the Dyson Institute of Engineering and Technology, our students are comprehensively inducted to a broad range of project work, spanning a wider range of engineering disciplines for which they build and refine their workplace competencies.
Provision of opportunities to gain professional experience is considered best practice by PSRBs and greatly add to student employability, their sense of their own direction, and identity as engineers.
However, this workplace activity may be in a work context where there would be strong security or commercial sensitivities. Across different institutions, we have supervised students who have worked in – for example – nuclear reprocessing, commercial aeronautics, agriculture, or innovative materials.
When these students return to their course and seek to evidence their workplace learning, it is usual for a student to negotiate a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) in respect of what they can and cannot share with their university supervisor and the wider university community. It goes without saying that uploading any such material to a generative AI tool to – for example – aid compilation of a portfolio, technical poster, or reflective report would compromise the confidentiality the student had promised and could inadvertently place the institution in a precarious legal position.
These dual issues – of confidentiality and intellectual property relating to generative AI – are still in their infancy. In August this year, OpenAI introduced ChatGPT Enterprise as a way of attempting to mitigate some of the concerns around data and security by allowing organisations to tailor the period with which internal data lives in the model, provide different levels of data access and prevent business-critical data from becoming foundational to a model’s training.
In the theoretical instances where a business allows such data to be used with generative AI, you can foresee such configurations coming at a significant expense, with responsible universities needing to pay to ensure there are appropriate safeguards in place.
If institutions are to encourage students to utilise generative AI in the innovative ways they are currently calling for, this would likely involve commercial data. However, in reality, the prospect of a business willingly sharing cutting-edge commercial data is unfathomable until generative AI tools afford greater visibility and clarity of internal workings, rather than the current black box (input/output) experience they offer. This calls for distributed control with industry taking ownership of their own models with formalisation of their own protocol(s) and governance structures to support the use of business data confidentially.
And what about students who have produced their own designs or creative work? It is still unclear whether ChatGPT (for example) is trained on copyrighted material.
Cases are still working their way through the courts, for example bestselling household-name fiction and non-fiction authors John Grisham, Jodi Picoult and Julian Sancton who have taken legal action against OpenAI. OpenAI outlined a legal strategy that proposes paying costs for clients sued for copyright infringement, as opposed to outlining an arguably more sustainable solution to take action to remove copyrighted content from their repository. In this scenario, universities embedding the use of AI in learning, teaching and assessment might have their legal costs covered by the OpenAI service provider, for as long as OpenAI pledges to commit to, but they would not be indemnified from fault.
Don’t just “lean in”
So, we urge caution. More progressive educators, educational developers, and institutions will want to lean into generative AI as an exciting teaching tool. But they should only do that when they know with clarity that generative AI is truly bolstering creativity, understanding whose data is being input, what the expectations for IP and confidentiality are, and whether those requirements can be met.
As it stands, generative AI services operate on legally unstable ground with cost models that have yet to emerge and stabilise. These are fundamental questions that can’t be answered with any real degree of confidence, and the stakes are high.

One response to “Caution is needed around generative AI, especially when work-based learning is involved”





Alan Smithee says: 

Jan 24 2024 at 3:23 pm 


Nobody wants to hear this but this is why everyone is racing into the arms of Microsoft in Higher Education because they have thought about or tried to pre-empt these questions in most areas.
For example: “In this scenario, universities embedding the use of AI in learning, teaching and assessment might have their legal costs covered by the OpenAI service provider”.
Microsoft are clear in the contractual document that there is a “Copilot Copyright commitment” – if there is a legal challenge, they are clear that they will assume responsibility. 
Same with what happens to data that is used within the organisation they are clear that it’s not used for training datasets. 
For most organisations, it’s an extension of an solid existing relationship with a mature player.

Drawing on a recent survey of academic perceptions and uses of generative AI, Richard Watermeyer, Donna Lanclos and Lawrie Phipps suggest that the potential efficiency promised by these tools disclose which work is and isn’t valued in academia.

Widespread use of generative AI tools in academia seems inevitable. This is one of the conclusions drawn from our recent study of how academics in the UK are using Large Language Models (LLMs). Through a survey of 284 UK academics we found that even those whose use of generative AI is sparse and/or tentative, anticipate the transformation of their professional lives through more efficient and economical ways of working.
At a time when academic success is determined by the speed and subsequent volume of productive output, generative AI seems to offer a way to do things more quickly. Its enthusiasts describe it as providing ‘faster ways to process data’ and in terms of how it ‘saves scientists time and money’. One respondent in our survey reported using LLMs to more than triple the number of research funding applications they had submitted within one year. Others spoke of how LLMs could be used to outsource up to 80% of their work. However, even if generative AI is increasing academics’ work-rate, it’s not clear whether its impact on workload and work quality will witness a commensurate uptick.
even if generative AI is increasing academics’ work-rate, it’s not clear whether its impact on workload and work quality will witness a commensurate uptick.
While we found in our study a common refrain of generative AI alleviating the burden and drudgery of heavy administrative loads, we found scant evidence of generative AI being used to decelerate and exploit the ‘gift of time’ for, among other things, higher order thinking and intellectual growth. Instead, our respondents talked almost exclusively about how LLMs had enhanced their productivity and capacity to meet performance demands.
It may be thus that the intercession of generative AI results not in any major disruption to the nature of academic work, but rather the further magnification of its product. This leads us to ask whether AI-enabled academics might be moving too quickly through the gears, and losing sight of the significance of tasks that are easily automated. It may be that important tasks are overlooked where generative AI is used to fast-track processes. Is the hype around generative AI consequently muddying what academics should be doing and obscuring the reward(s) of such undertaking?
We have seen how generative AI ‘helps’ write manuscripts, grant applications, presentations, e-mails, code, coursework and exam questions. Yet presently, the parameters of ‘help’ are ill-defined and unaided by the immaturity of regulatory intervention and consensus concerning the ethics of AI use. Consequently, just as generative AI may excessively help students in the realm of assessment so too may it excessively ‘help’ academics.
While the affordances of generative AI to academic work may appear obvious, recognising when generative AI should be used and when it shouldn’t, is less so. The danger is that enthusiasm for generative AI as an efficiency aid, obfuscates the tasks that academics should remain focused on. The ‘triumph’ of generative AI in terms of productivity gain may accordingly culminate (if it hasn’t already) in its indiscriminate use.
just as generative AI may excessively help students in the realm of assessment so too may it excessively ‘help’ academics.
By streamlining and removing stages of ‘process’ in academic labour, where these are delegated to machine intelligence, the iterative dimension of knowledge work loses out to ‘algorithmic conformity’, and so too constrains serendipity, happenstance and the unpredictability of scientific discovery. Research rarely pans out as it is initially conceived or intended; the greatest findings are often decided by chance. Moreover, in accelerating already hyper-stimulated work regimes in universities, generative AI may exacerbate an epidemic of burn out among academics and cause them to leave their roles in even greater numbers than are already reported. It may furthermore become as a snare to those whose employment is most precarious and contingent upon the promptness  and regularity of their output. Where generative AI further buries exhortations for slow scholarship, disincentivises the hard and long slog of intellectual inquiry, and displaces human-generated content, the contribution of the academic becomes increasingly degraded and susceptible to detraction.
Perhaps, the emergence of generative AI should then be grasped to reflect on and respond to what is already redundant in academia?
Yet these questions of technology-aided or technology-diminished contributions are useful to elucidate the extent to which academia is already automated, already dominated by a culture of profligate repetition and reproduction, ‘copy and paste’ and short-cuts to productive accumulation. Perhaps, the emergence of generative AI should then be grasped to reflect on and respond to what is already redundant in academia? Generative AI might then be assessed as, and developed into a form of help which does not deskill but reskills academics and reenergises their intellectual mission. It might also be used to enjoin a reappraisal of what really matters in academia beyond a false economy of productive efficiency and for the purpose of enculturing a new kind of adaptability among academics amidst winds of alleged change.
If not, academics’ dependency on generative AI as a means of coping with productivity demands will only likely escalate as will exploitation by those who wield precarity unashamedly for the purpose of leveraging maximum value extraction.

Excellent, and about time.
About time that academics focus on actual research and actual teaching rather than on writing grant proposals and developing teaching material.
Hopefully, a better way of awarding grants can be found, and the joy of teaching can be rediscovered.

I use it all day every day in my programming course. I could use it to save time as it can complete coursework virtually by itself.
Howeber, that would mean i don’t learn. Instead I use it as a 24 hour personal tutor. 
If I don’t unddrstand a coding concept, I ask it all the same questions as I would a human tutor.
Funnily enough fee people use it on my course, possibly due to concerns about plagiarism.
Based on the questions i heae those people ask, and based on assessment scores they don’t understand the material as well.
So tech students are either not using it, using it inneficiently or to borderline cheat, or using it as a tutor. The latter actually takes up time, but it also prepares one for the workplace where coders take every shortcut they can get.
Industry workers are doing the same job, only much faster which seems to have finally burst the ridiculous contract heavy tech market the UK has been trapped in for years.
Those contractors milking businesses by overplaying the amount of experience they have in, say Workday, are no longer commanding £750 per day.
The life-long contractors are now all feeling the pinch of having a jumpy CV, whilst complaining they can’t earn 3-4 x their permanent equivalents anymore.
Gone too are their tax dodging practices, so its going to be tough for them but I won’t shed a tear.
I just hope the UK educational institutions embrace the technology instead of falling for a get-rich-quick anti-gpt scheme as they did over the pond

Considerations for Artificial Intelligence and Employment Law
As artificial intelligence (“AI”) technologies become more ubiquitous and advanced, both the advantages and potential risks they pose for employers continue to grow as well. This is especially true with regard to the use of generative AI – that is, AI that can generate original content based on data patterns. This type of AI can produce original images, text, music and designs, among other things. With the rising use of AI, we are seeing a corresponding rise in legislation, guidance and litigation addressing the use and consequences of AI. One area where this is increasingly common is the employment sphere.
AI in the Employment Cycle
More and more, employers are using AI in various aspects of the employment cycle. Recruitment is one of the stages when AI is used most, including through resume screening, video interviews, pre-employment assessment and automated candidate services. During employment, AI may be used in various ways, such as automated employee service, skill development, performance management and in various everyday work tasks.
These usages, though, can pose various risks to employers that use AI.
The Risks of AI in Employment
Title VII and Machine Learning AI
Title VII – the landmark anti-discrimination law – prohibits employers from using neutral tests or selection procedures unrelated to the position and inconsistent with business necessity when those tests or procedures disproportionately exclude persons of a protected class (i.e., race, color, religion, sex, national origin).
When such an effect results from such neutral tests or selection procedures, it is known as disparate impact or adverse impact discrimination. This type of discrimination is generally only an issue with predictive AI tools because that type of AI utilizes algorithms to recognize data patterns and make predictions – which can lead to biased results when the underlying algorithms are biased (even if inadvertently so).
In May 2023, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) released guidance specifically addressing the use of AI for employee selection processes. According to the EEOC, AI has an “adverse impact” when the selection rate for one group is “substantially” less than the selection rate for another group. The May 2023 guidance set forth the “Four-Fifths Rule” for determining what “substantially” means. The acceptance rate for a class of applicants is “substantially” different from the acceptance rate of another class of applicants if the ratio of the two rates is less than four-fifths (80%). Not only do employers need to make sure their selection processes are in line with these requirements, but they can still be liable for discriminatory selection procedures even if the AI tool used for the procedures was developed by a third party or administered by an agent. 
ADA and Machine Learning AI
Similar to what was done with Title VII, the EEOC issued guidance addressing concerns with the use of AI in interacting with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”). That guidance provides three main examples of AI violating the ADA:
1. If the AI usage results in a failure to provide a reasonable accommodation – this may occur when an applicant or employee requests a reasonable accommodation and the disability is likely to make it more difficult to use the AI tool or make an assessment less accurate and the employer fails to provide an alternative format.
2. If the AI usage results in an intentional or unintentional screening out of disabled applicants – this may occur when an AI tool results in lower scores for assessments as a result of a disability, such as giving a lower rank to applicants with significant gaps in employment history or with specific speech or movement patterns.
3. If the AI system makes “disabilityrelated inquiries” or conducts “medical examinations” prior to extending a conditional offer of employment – this can also violate the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act.
Labor Law and AI
The broad scope of Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act’s right of employees to self-organize and bargain collectively can also be affected by AI usage. The National Labor Relations Board General Counsel issued a memo in October 2022 setting forth numerous ways the use of AI tools can violate Section 7, including when:

AI tools surveil/gather information regarding employee Section 7 activities – even if merely creating the impression of surveillance;
Employees are disciplined for protesting the use of AI tools for employee monitoring/ management;
AI tools include personality tests to evaluate an employee’s propensity to engage in protected Section 7 activities;
AI tools use algorithms to make decisions based on union representation;
AI tools use algorithms that include production quotas or efficiency standards to single out union supporters;
Employers fail to provide information about the implementation/use of AI technology to employees; and
Employers fail to bargain with employees over the implementation/use of AI technology in the workplace.

Legislative and Litigation Trends
Cybersecurity
Adding to the growing mix of guidance is November’s Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence (EO).i Among other things, the EO addresses cybersecurity requirements that must be considered by federal agencies and AI developers given AI’s ability to be leveraged by threat actors.
Cybersecurity threats posed by AI – known as, adversarial AI – include the vivid examples highlighted by Jonathan Care in his article aptly titled, “Fight AI with AI.”
[A]n autonomous vehicle that has been manipulated could cause a serious accident, or a facial recognition system that has been attacked could misidentify individuals and lead to false arrests. These attacks can come from a variety of sources, including malicious actors, and could be used to spread disinformation, conduct cyberattacks, or commit other types of crimes.
For these and other safety and security reasons, the EO requires the establishment of an advanced cybersecurity program to develop AI tools to find and fix vulnerabilities in critical software. The EO also includes deadlines by when certain standards must be established for such things as physical and cybersecurity protections (90 days) and safety and security guidelines for use by critical infrastructure owners and operators (180 days).ii
Data Privacy
Another major concern with AI is its natural intersection with data privacy – AI usage of consumer and employee data lends itself to potential problems with maintaining the privacy of that data. At the same time, many states are taking a stronger approach to data privacy, with numerous states passing data privacy laws in the past year or so, with some of those states – including California, Colorado, Connecticut, Iowa, Utah and Virginia – even specifically addressing AI in their privacy laws.
Beyond just state law, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) has also exercised its authority to regulate algorithmic consumer data usage under Section 5 of the FTC Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. The FTC specifically has encouraged deployers of AI to take steps to:

Ensure transparency through disclosures;
Monitor data inputs and outputs to prevent class discrimination;
Grant user-access to delete or correct personal information;
Ensure output data is accurate;
Protect the algorithm from unauthorized use or breaches;
Implement accountability structure to help maintain compliance.

The FTC further recommends that employers remove any identifying data before entering it into any AI platform.
Data privacy concerns in particular are becoming a heightened concern for employers, as courts begin to view employer obligations in protecting such data more broadly. In Ramirez v. Paradies, the Eleventh Circuit found that traditional tort law – and the duty of care, the special relationship between employers and employees, and the foreseeability of harm thereunder – could impute liability to an employer that suffered a ransomware attack on its administrative systems leading to the unauthorized disclosure of current and former employees’ social security numbers. With AI potentially increasing the collection of personal information on employees and courts and legislatures heightening scrutiny on employer protection of that information, employers should take a careful look at their processes and procedures for protecting employee data.
Automated Employment Decisions
New York City has already passed a law regulating automated employment decision tools (“AEDTs”). The law is meant to prevent bias in the use of AEDTs and requires that AEDTs undergo bias auditing within the year prior to use when (a) the employer relies “solely” on the AEDT in making employment decisions; (b) the employer relies on other factors in addition to the AEDT output but weighs the AEDT output more heavily than any other criterion; or (c) the AEDT output is used in a way that can overrule conclusions from other factors, including human decisionmaking. In addition to the bias auditing, employers must also provide notice to employees and applicants of the AEDTs’ use and publish the audit results, and they must retain AEDT records and reveal them to employees upon request. As the use of AI and AEDTs increases, an increase in this type of regulation can be expected.
Under the draft regulations, ADMT has a broad definition and includes any system, software or process (including those derived from AI) that processes personal information and uses computation, either on its own or as part of a system, to make or execute a decision or facilitate human decision-making.
Specific AI State Legislation
Many state legislatures, including those of California, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Vermont, as well as the D.C. legislature, have proposed legislation relating to the use of AI in the employment sphere. More states will likely follow suit. These laws would be expected to prohibit “algorithmic discrimination” and put in place notice and accommodation requirements for the use of AI in employment decisions.
EEOC Litigation and Settlement
In May 2022, the EEOC filed an age discrimination lawsuit against a group of affiliated companies employing English language tutors. According to the EEOC, for a brief period in the spring of 2020, those companies programmed application software to automatically reject female applicants over 55 years old and male applicants over age 60. The lawsuit alleged this screening process affected over 200 applicants who were above the programmed age thresholds. The parties reached an expansive settlement, including a consent decree subjecting the employers to various nonmonetary obligations, including providing notice of the lawsuit to high-level executives and HR employees, retaining a third-party group to conduct extensive training on all federal equal employment opportunity laws, and inviting the rejected applicants to reapply (with reporting obligations to the EEOC). It can be expected this will just be the first of many such actions by the EEOC. 
Looking Ahead
The landscape in terms of the use of AI and its regulation is constantly evolving as new technologies develop and become more accessible. With many states already working on legislation to regulate AI usage, the trend can be expected to continue moving forward. The same is true in terms of litigation – both in terms of data privacy and in AI. As has already been seen, the EEOC likely will be focused on the use of AI in employment decisions, and many more lawsuits and settlements can be expected.
Employers navigating in this new arena should keep several things in mind moving forward. Consider auditing vendor AI systems that are being used for potential biased algorithms. Conduct HR and hiring manager training on the proper use of AI systems. Limit employees’ access to AI tools to prevent misuse. Implement policies to limit AI use to preapproved circumstances. Provide notice to applications and employees of AI usage. Conduct privacy impact assessments to determine the risk to individuals and applicable mitigation measures. Update incident response plans to address the cybersecurity threats AI may pose to employee data. With an ever-changing world of AI, employers need to be prepared to handle the advancements and challenges that lie ahead.

Generative AI set to disrupt jobs



New research suggests that most jobs could be disrupted in some way by generative AI in the next ten years.
The study published on January 10th by tech consulting firm Cognizant, in collaboration with Oxford Economics, found that around 9% of the current US workforce may be displaced by the new technology. It also reported that thanks to AI, 11% of workers may lose their jobs and struggle to find new employment.
This difficulty comes as the skills workers possess for their current roles may not be easily transferable to a job market increasingly dominated by artificial intelligence.
A specialized model was used to reveal three scenarios reflecting low, middle, and high levels of AI business adoption, which first examined how quickly artificial intelligence would be utilized within a company.
The authors explain that from 2023 to 2026, users will be in the “experimentation and cautious” phase, with organizations tentatively deploying generative AI for tasks that are “manageable in scope and low in risk — like image creation, text generation for reports and emails, and code suggestions for developers.” It is expected that 13% of businesses will implement this during this period.
It is said that by 2026 to 2030, there will be a notable rise in Al’s role across a range of professions. The top-end prediction reveals that AI usage will leap from 13% to 31% in just four to eight years. The research also claims that more than half of all general managers and operations managers will be exposed to AI by this time.
The researchers also believe that after 15 years, while AI employment will continue, it is likely to slow down.
Recommendations for upskilling the workforce
The study recommends that employees are “reskilled” in order to try and protect them from job losses and to maintain a brand’s reputation. It also proposes that organizations build a robust technological infrastructure designed to accommodate the rapid pace of AI development, including policies, structures, and operating processes.
At the same time, it warns against potential bias formulated by AI. The research calls for organizations to create safeguards that minimize the risk of partiality, error, and ethically problematic decisions. Finally, it also encourages using AI to benefit employees’ lives by shortening the workday or week.
The video gaming industry has already called for guardrails against AI. In December, the game workers union at Zenimax announced that they had reached an agreement with Microsoft that “commits ZeniMax to uses of AI that augment human ingenuity and capacities, to ensure that these tools enhance worker productivity, growth, and satisfaction without causing workers harm.”

But AI is still far too expensive to replace humans in most jobs for now,  according to a study  by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The research looked into the practicalities of replacing human labour with AI in jobs in the United States where computer vision was employed, such as teachers, bakers and property appraisers.  The study found that only 23 per cent of workers’ wages could be cost-effectively replaced by AI. The researchers also predicted that it would still take decades for computer vision tasks to become financially efficient for companies, even with a 20 per cent drop in cost per year. Computer vision in AI allows machines to draw information from visual and digital inputs. In a hypothetical bakery, used as an example in the study, computer vision was used to inspect ingredients for quality control. But that task is only six per cent of their work and would cost more to install and operate the technology than for a human to perform the task.  The study, financed by the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, used online surveys to gather information on roughly 1,000 visually assisted tasks in 800 occupations. It found that in many cases it was more expensive to install and maintain AI systems than for a human to perform the same tasks. “‘Machines will steal our jobs’ is a sentiment frequently expressed during times of rapid technological change. Such anxiety has re-emerged with the creation of large language models,” the researchers said in the 45-page paper titled “Beyond AI Exposure”.  “We find that only 23 per cent of worker compensation ‘exposed’ to AI computer vision would be cost-effective for firms to automate because of the large upfront costs of AI systems”. Since OpenAI’s ChatGPT exploded onto the scene in November 2022, fears have mounted over the possibility of AI causing job losses in industries spanning the arts to banking. A Goldman Sachs report in 2023 estimated that 18 per cent of work globally could be affected by generative AI.  But last week in Davos,  OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman  said artificial general intelligence (AGI), a  hypothesised form of AI with intelligence that can perform tasks like humans,  “will change the world much less than we all think and it will change jobs much less than we all think”.

Artificial Intelligence Use Continues to Rise in Employment

Updated: Jan 24, 2024




As 2023 wound down, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) by employers showed no sign of slowing down. Rather, you should prepare for an increased use and presence of AI in employment decision-making, as well as employee engagement.




Intersection of Technology and Employment Law
Throughout 2023, an increasing number of states and cities began limiting the use of AI in employment decision-making, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s (EEOC) draft strategic enforcement plan (SEP) likewise outlined its intended approach to employers’ use of AI. As the year progressed, both states and the federal government continued to crack down on AI use in employment in cases that resulted in discrimination or discriminatory impact.



More specifically, multiple states proposed legislation in 2023 addressing individuals’ data privacy rights, with some including provisions addressing AI use in employment. In Washington, for example, the People’s Privacy Act sought to prohibit covered entities from, among other things, “the use of artificial intelligence-enabled profiling to make decisions that produce legal effects or similarly significant effects concerning individuals” (including employment opportunities). Although this specific legislation hasn’t passed through committee, it signals that states are increasingly primed to legislate the intersection of technology and employment law.

	



Eliminating Barriers
Similarly, the EEOC’s finalized SEP for 2024 to 2028 included six “subject matter priorities,” with the first being “eliminating barriers in recruitment and hiring.” Within this subject matter priority, the EEOC stated it will focus on “the use of technology, including artificial intelligence and machine learning, to target job advertisements, recruit applicants, or make or assist in hiring decisions where such systems intentionally exclude or adversely impact protected groups.”



The SEP likewise advises that the EEOC will focus on “the use of screening tools or requirements that disproportionately impact workers on a protected basis, including those facilitated by artificial intelligence or other automated systems, pre-employment tests, and background checks.”



EEOC Pursuing AI Discrimination Claims
The EEOC’s SEP wasn’t the end of its involvement in AI and employment decision-making in 2023. Rather, the agency made headlines when it settled its first case involving AI discrimination in the workplace.



As we wrote about previously, the EEOC asserted age and gender discrimination claims against three integrated companies providing English-language tutoring services to students in China under the name iTutorGroup (see “EEOC targeting discriminatory use of artificial intelligence” in the April 2023 newsletter).



According to the EEOC, the companies’ tutor application software automatically rejected female applicants and male applicants over the age of 60. The companies settled the lawsuit with the EEOC for $365,000, along with their agreement to adopt antidiscrimination policies, conduct training, and more.



Increased Employee Use of AI
Significantly, AI in employment isn’t used only by employers. You should expect employees to continue to use the technology moving forward. For example, national nonprofit organization Moms First partnered with other philanthropic entities and AI research/development companies (including OpenAI) to create PaidLeave.ai, a website that explains New York’s paid leave laws and helps those seeking such leave to obtain it.



According to its website, PaidLeave.ai was “designed to simplify [an individual’s] journey, providing clear answers and support every step of the way—from understanding [the individual’s] eligibility to navigating paperwork and planning [his/her] leave.”



Critically, the website intends to help provide documents and supporting resources individuals “can bring to [their] HR manager.” Although this resource is currently set to support only those seeking paid leave in New York, the potential for similar resources to arrive for other state leave laws—or even federal leave laws, such as the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)—isn’t out of the question.



Tips for Employers in 2024
How should you prepare for AI’s role in 2024? Here are a few tips to keep in mind:




If you are an employer that uses (or intends to use) AI in employment decision-making, ensure the processes comply with any applicable state law, as well as the guidance from the EEOC’s SEP. You should be aware that failure to follow the laws and EEOC guidance can lead to costly litigation, as exemplified by the iTutorGroup lawsuit.
Prepare for more sophisticated requests for leave and accommodation, as well as potential complaints of discrimination, from employees using AI to draft such documentation/requests.
Ensure policies/procedures address the use of AI by employees (e.g., the submission of the company’s or its customers’ confidential information to AI platforms).
Consult with counsel regarding any questions related to the use of AI in the employment context, whether such use occurs from the employer or the employee.

Although such concerns tend to ignore technology's potential to create jobs, new forms of AI do pose a risk to some workers, new research from Indeed suggests: white-collar workers.""Surprisingly enough, knowledge workers are facing the highest level of exposure here, which is quite different with what we've seen with other revolutions,"" Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Indeed Hiring Lab, a job-search platform, told CBS MoneyWatch. ""With automation, often it was manual labor that was replaced.""Unlike previous cycles of technical innovation, in-person, often low-wage jobs that rely heavily on humans being physically present are likely to be the the most resilient to encroaching AI, she added. 






""Driving cars still currently takes a person. Or child care. We probably wouldn't give our kids over to the robots quite yet,"" she said. Gudell added that ""We'll see the destruction of some jobs but also the creation of others along way. The human element still carries a lot of weight in these jobs — you really can't do without it.""What jobs are most at risk?Among the openings currently on Indeed, software and coding jobs are the most exposed to replacement by AI, the firm found in a its analysis. That's because so-called generative AI was determined to be adept at performing 95% of the skills these jobs require. 


In addition to software development, information technology, mathematics, information design, legal and accounting positions are also among the more exposed professions.By contrast, truck and taxi driver jobs are least exposed to AI, which could only adequately perform about 30% of the necessary skills, according to Indeed. Other jobs that are relatively insulated against AI include cleaning and sanitation as well as beauty and wellness jobs, in part because they are least likely to be performed remotely. 






AI job interviews are becoming more common. Here's how to ace them.

Another key takeway, according to Indeed: The more suitable a job is to remote work, the higher its potential exposure is to generative AI-driven change. ""A lot of in-person jobs heavily rely on that human element. You might mix in parts of generative AI there, but at the end of the day a nurse still needs to be present to stick the needle in the patient's arm to draw blood. With sales reps, a lot of in-person communication happens when talking to clients,"" Gudell said.


To be sure, AI is unlikely ever to fully replace humans even in areas where the technology excels. But it may supplant some workers whose jobs are rote and who don't employ AI to make them more productive. ""It could mean you as an employee can use these tools and focus on higher productivity-level skills on the job. From the employer perspective, instead of hiring 15 copy editors, you might employ five because generative AI carries the load,"" Gudell said. Of all the vacant positions on its platform, Indeed said that 20% are highly exposed to generative AI. Just over 45% are moderately exposed, and 35% are minimally exposed, the firm found.Still, it is likely premature for workers in highly exposed occupations to overhaul their careers based solely on the potential threat of AI, according to Indeed. ""It's too early to switch to another job because we are still in the beginning days of this technological advancement,"" Gudell said. ""We will see what it means for jobs of the future, to see how it will be translated to everyday actions on job.""

Generative AI copyright issues won’t be solved by blockchain.
Multiple lawsuits attempt to claw back owners’ rights.
Use of ‘scraped’ materials is ‘fair use.’

The economic viability of machine learning as a service (MLaaS) is being stymied by a host of lawsuits, most notably against Anthropic and OpenAI. In all cases, owners of copyrighted material object to and seek compensation for the use of materials used without their permission to train machine learning models.
Generative AI models used by companies like OpenAI scrape vast amounts of data from the public internet, but the companies claim their methods constitute ‘fair use’ of publicly-available materials. There are several legal arguments in play, including “volitional conduct,” which refers to the idea that a company that commits copyright infringement has to be shown to have control over the output of the disputed materials. In short, if you can get OpenAI to disgorge a line of poetry, verbatim, that’s been published under a notice of copyright (say, at the bottom of the web page it’s published on), OpenAI is in breach of copyright.

In the case of the New York Times‘s action against OpenAI, the newspaper claims the ML engine crawled and absorbed millions of NYT articles to inform the popular AI engine, gaining a “free ride on the Times’s massive investment in its journalism,” according to the text of the lawsuit.
Generative AI copyright lawsuits
Similar cases have been brought against Midjourney and Stability AI (owners of Stable Diffusion) by Getty Images, who also cite copyright infringement of images they own the rights to. Class action suits have also been brought DeviantArt, whose machine models produce images from users’ text prompts.
Giving evidence to the UK’s House of Lords Communications and Digital Select Committee, OpenAI claimed, “[…] it would be impossible to train today’s leading AI models without using copyrighted materials.” In this, the company admits it’s trained models on materials legally owned by others, but it’s ‘fair use.’

The case of Getty Images is particularly noteworthy. The company had steered wide of any AI image creation offering, citing “real concerns with respect to the copyright of outputs from these models and unaddressed rights issues with respect to the imagery, the image metadata, and those individuals contained within the imagery,” said Getty’s CEO, Craig Peters in an article in The Verge in 2022.
However, the company announced ‘Generative AI by iStock’ at CES 2024, which draws on its library of images, claiming legal protection and usage rights for content creators. “You can rest assured that the images you generate, and license, are backed by our uncapped indemnification,” the company’s website now states, and that it’s “created a model that compensates […] content creators for the use of their work in our AI model, allowing them to continue to create more […] pre‑shot imagery you depend on.”

Enforcing copyright has always been problematic online, especially if the owner of published media lacks the backing of a phalanx of sharp-toothed lawyers, shoals of whom tend to congregate around large businesses and organizations rather than independent content creators. The choice for artists, musicians, and even part-time bloggers has always, since the internet began, been whether or not to publish. Put the message or media ‘out there,’ and it’s open to potential exploitation by others. Don’t publish digitally, and risk obscurity. Halfway houses like robots.txt files that state “No ML crawlers” in the same way that it’s hoped search engines will not index website pages (“no follow, pleeease”) are a gamble that trusts the inherent good nature of huge corporations controlling the ML models, like Microsoft in the case of Open AI.
Because nobody ever got burned trusting huge corporations. Right?
Blockchain to solve copyright issues?
Speaking to Business Insider last week, the CEO of cryptocurrency trading specialist Greyscale, Michael Sonnenshein, suggested blockchain would be an immutable way of proving copyrighted material’s provenance. “[…] To us, it’s just so obvious that you need an irrefutable, immutable technology to marry [authenticity and ownership], to actually head-on address some of the issues, and that technology is blockchain, which underpins crypto[currency]. […] All of a sudden, issues like provenance and authenticity and ownership, etc., get resolved really, really quickly.”
There are three reasons why Sonneshein’s assertions are fallacious. Firstly, we already have an ascertained authenticity via blockchain: it’s a Ponzi scheme called NFTs, which are vauled only by the idiots who trade in them. Secondly, blockchain publication has the potential to be ecologically disastrous. The coin mining industry for Bitcoin, Ether, and Monero produces the equivalent carbon of a medium-sized country each year. For example, each $1 value of Bitcoin produces $0.50 in environmental and health damage (primarily through air pollution from fossil fuel generation powering mining rigs). Thirdly, if we ensure creators are “properly compensated and credited for what they produce,” because blockcahin tells us, without doubt, who they are, we have come full circle. To re-quote OpenAI’s statement in the UK’s House of Lords committee rooms:
“[…] it would be impossible to train today’s leading AI models without using copyrighted materials.” What the word “impossible” means, in context, is “too costly.” Could you imagine a world where big AI-as-a-service providers track down and pay every content creator on the internet for the use of their work to train AI models? No, neither can we.

As a content creator, the only sure-fire way to protect copyright is to digitally encrypt every item, or place it behind some kind of insurmountable barrier where it can’t be scraped. That’s a paywall, or equivalent walled garden in front of every creator’s work. At a stroke, the internet – designed to be a place for the free and open interchange of ideas, knowledge, and perhaps art – becomes the victim of voracious machine learning algorithms controlled by global businesses.
The world in which generative AI and copyright peacefully co-exist may be attainable. What it won’t be is either cost-effective or easy to achieve.

Gert Jan, a paraplegic patient at the Lausanne University Hospital, performs walking tests with the help of a brain-spinal cord interface developed by researchers, Lausanne, Switzerland. (Gilles Weber)
Artificial intelligence continues to develop at a breakneck pace, transforming one industry after another. One area where AI has already proven successful is in improving the day-to-day lives of people with disabilities. Examples include a brain-spinal chord interface that helps people relearn how to walk, AI-enabled voice assistants (such as Olga Phone and Google Assistant) which make it easier for visually impaired people to use their smartphones, learning algorithms that enable computers to understand users’ intentions and anticipate a command, etc.
Around 87 million people in the European Union suffer from some form of disability, which can sometimes result in their exclusion from the workplace or even from society as whole. According to figures published by the European Parliament in June 2020, there is significant room for improvement when it comes to their professional integration: the employment rate for people with disabilities in the EU (ages 20 to 64) stands at 50.8 per cent, compared to 75 per cent for able-bodied people.
Given that access to employment depends first and foremost on access to training, how can disabled people be better helped to learn using AI tools?
Impact AI is a French think tank whose members include companies, start-ups and schools that train future data analysts. Together, they are looking for solutions to create “conditions conducive to human-centred AI”.
The group has carried out research in partnership with the EdTech association to study specific needs (according to the type of disability: hearing, visual, physical, cognitive, etc.) and identify existing technological solutions. These are generally based on powerful algorithms and intelligent software capable of analysing data and generating responses to certain commands. They facilitate, for example, image recognition and analysis, lip-reading, transcription of audio into text (dictation, generation of subtitles), translation into sign language, etc.
One of the projects the group is presenting and supporting is Roger Voice, a “solution combining automatic speech recognition and voice intonation,” designed for the deaf and hard of hearing. Another is ISIcrunch, a software solution that uses artificial intelligence to produce online texts (such as ebooks or epubs) by digitising teaching materials and converting them into accessible formats.
Increasing the availability of digital resources for people with sensory or cognitive impairments represents a major challenge for inclusion and the future of work, and is the subject of an international treaty between the European Union and the World Intellectual Property Organisation.
Professional integration: pitfalls and perspectives 
According to Jan Ramon, a researcher at the French National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology (INRIA), “integration into working life is better thanks to technology”. Some workers with disabilities are already using automatic transcription and text recognition to help them with their tasks. “I think that AI will help these people [more and more] over the years to come. But it’s early days yet”. In Ramon’s opinion, the latest developments in AI are still primarily aimed at the general public and often fail to target people with disabilities.
Federico Camporesi works for the Association for Research and Training on Integration in Europe (ARFIE) on the problems of integrating disabled workers into the workplace. In his view, “companies and even governments should invest in promoting progress in this area”.
AI technologies for disabled people have seen greater advances in certain business sectors, particularly those that involve work with computers and intellectual, rather than physical, functions.
Voice assistant technology is currently booming. Olivier Gatelmand is the founder of Olga, a voice assistant for smartphones designed for people with reduced autonomy or visual impairments. “We created the service seven years ago. At the time, artificial intelligence was not at all widespread. Every access to our phone is voice-activated. We implemented a system in Olga that enables conversational intelligence to be used to search for information. Users can then learn more easily and receive help in their decision-making. It’s kind of like a voice-activated ChatGPT”.
“[Currently] we are mainly focused on people with visual and motor disabilities. But it’s important to understand that disabled people have different abilities,” says Gatelmand, who has also addressed the possibility of diction problems in users.  “We’ve carried out tests with autistic children. Based on a specific case, we learned that artificial intelligence could potentially rephrase words in sentences that are difficult to understand”.
As a visually impaired person, Ramon uses services to help him in his day-to-day life. For example, when interviewed by Equal Times over Zoom, the words he says appear on his screen. It’s a way of getting a better grasp of what’s being said. “This technology still has room to improve”. He predicts that people who are deaf or hard of hearing will be able to obtain a similar application in “about two years.”
However, a number of questions remain unanswered, particularly with regards to the legislative framework for supporting the introduction of new tools. “Society evolves, opportunities evolve, but the problems associated with legislation require a great deal of knowledge,” continues Camporesi. “We need to clarify the issue of data management and privacy”.
The issue of digital privacy rights in relation to technology in the workplace is not specific to disabled workers alone.
Medical advances for greater autonomy in the future
Last August, the media reported that a new research breakthrough at Stanford University in the United States had enabled paralysed people to speak using brainwaves. Artificial intelligence can now transcribe neural signals into text and words. Thanks to a “device consisting of electrodes implanted in the brain,” patients can regain the use of speech with a synthetic voice that is personalised and closely approximates their original voice. While these pioneering trials are promising, there is still a long way to go to develop a technology that is smoother, less invasive and more widely accessible.
Another revolution is underway at the Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV), where Henri Lorach, project leader for the brain-spinal cord interface, has been running a project since 2018, whose aim is to enable people rendered paraplegic by accidents to regain the ability to walk.
“Initial results were published on primates. Researchers demonstrated the intention to walk and stimulate the spinal cord to restore voluntary motor function in the animals,” explains Lorach. “The NeuroRestore laboratory had been working on this subject for ten years. This work makes it possible for various muscles to be reactivated even years after an injury. Through electrical stimulation, we are able to abolish certain muscle responses and control walking. In 2018, an article appeared in the journal Nature”.
Artificial intelligence comes into play a little later in this novel process. “Initially, patterns were pre-programmed to make someone walk again. The second stage was to have an implant in the brain, above the motor cortex, to help the patient carry out the movements. Artificial intelligence then helps us to interpret the signals from the brain and to know which signals are linked to which intentions. We train the algorithm to know when the patient is thinking of bending their leg, extending their knee, etc. Our 64 electrodes record brain activity on the surface,” explains Lorach.
While only one patient is currently benefiting from this programme, “others are waiting. Our aim is to implant around ten people over the next three or four years”.

Credit: Jamie Goodman   The FMI Midwinter Executive Conference keynote session ""Putting Generative AI to Work for Food Retail"" brought industry leaders together to discuss the transformative impact of artificial intelligence in the grocery retail industry. Sponsored by Invafresh, Doug Baker, vice president, industry relations at FMI, led a conversation with Jose Luis-Gomes, managing director retail & consumer, at Google Cloud, addressing the current state of AI applications, future possibilities, and the challenges and responsibilities associated with AI adoption. The following are five takeaways from the session:Purposeful AI Implementation: Joe Smirlies, senior vice president, product management at Invafresh, kicked off the session by emphasizing the importance of harnessing AI's power for purposeful change. The focus should be on delivering meaningful transformation that benefits businesses and society as a whole.""While it really is the epitome of a transformative technology, the real question is, how do we harness its power?"" asked Smirlies. “More importantly, how do we harness this technology to deliver purposeful change and use it in a pragmatic way that helps businesses and, more broadly, society, be better?""Challenges and Responsibilities in AI Adoption: Luis-Gomes emphasized the need for a rigorous framework to evaluate AI initiatives, ensuring ethical considerations, and mitigating risks.""Every single initiative within Google that has AI as a component goes through a very rigorous framework,” said Luis-Gomes. “We actually call it Lemonade With Google Cloud, and that means that any initiative, whether it's an internal Google initiative or whether it's something our customer has asked us to do, goes through this framework and goes through an evaluation of an independent committee.”Regulation and Fast-Paced Innovation: Baker and Luis-Gomes touched on the multitude of ongoing discussions about AI regulation globally. As Baker noted, “this train is going extremely quickly.” Gomes acknowledged the increasing talks about regulation and the need for a balance between continued innovation and addressing potential risks.""I think that regulation is going to catch up if it isn't behind,” said Luis-Gomes. “I just think that if you think about where we were a year ago and where the technology has moved right now, we're all in a little bit of a catch-up mode.""The Grocery Industry's Progress in AI Adoption: Luis-Gomes expressed optimism about the grocery industry's adoption of AI, noting its data richness as a foundation for applying AI at scale. He acknowledged the challenges, such as the need for engineering talent, but highlighted the industry's quick adoption of technology, likely because the grocery industry is less regulated than healthcare or financial services for example.""Compared to many others, we actually have a phenomenal foundation to really apply AI at scale, so I'm really bullish about [the grocery industry’s] ability to do that.”Data's Role in AI: Baker asked about the need for clean, accurate, unified data to effectively power AI. Luis-Gomes acknowledged the importance of good data but also highlighted AI's ability to create data and presented an example of using AI to enhance product attributes. He noted the company worked with one retailer with over a hundred million products, and the company built out 1.2 billion attributes for them, taking the average attribute for every product from about 1.5 to around 12. This enabled the retailer to drive much better personalization, both in search and recommendation. “Good data is super important,” said Luis-Gomes. “The great news is, and I'm probably going to use this catchphrase, is that AI can now also create the data for you. And that's a new paradigm.”This was originally published on RIS News, a CGT sister publication.

If 2023 was the breakout year for artificial intelligence, then 2024 will be the year it starts to mature, with new jobs focusing on AI. This happens inevitably with every technological revolution -- technology takes off at a gallop and areas such as security and management must catch up.







In 2024, there will be a greater focus on data integrity, security and privacy. There will also be greater interest in the part of content creators on their data being used or not used for generative AI. In late 2023, The New York Times sued Microsoft and OpenAI over the use of Times' content in ChatGPT.
In addition, models are expected to both grow and shrink. They will grow as AI tries to become more comprehensive and helpful, but they will also shrink to become focused on one area of specificity.
They will also shrink because AI processing is moving off giant GPU farms and onto desktops and handheld devices. Intel, AMD and Qualcomm are all making processes with AI accelerators for desktop and laptop PCs. Inevitably, smartphone handsets will also be doing AI processing.

All this AI growth means more jobs. Below is a list of what might be the 10 hottest AI jobs and skills for 2024.

Top AI job skills
Being a successful AI developer requires more than just coding skills. Of course, proficiency in a core AI developer language such as Python, Java and R, along with emerging languages such as Julia or Scala, is essential.
AI jobs require knowledge of data modeling and engineering to structure and preprocess data for efficient AI training and analysis. Individuals also need to understand machine learning and deep learning, and be knowledgeable in various algorithms, model architectures and optimization techniques.
In addition to programming skills, individuals need to know libraries and frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn and scikit-image, and have a strong background in mathematics and statistics.
AI jobs require critical thinking skills to solve problems and analyze user input. The same practices apply to code. Having strong mathematical skills can help people develop advanced algorithms for programs.
AI is also unique because it requires some knowledge of psychology. To create AI, people need to understand how humans think and how they might behave in different situations. AI simulates human behavior.
Finally, with an emphasis on AI security, privacy and data integrity, individuals need to know the best practices behind security and ethics.
Some industries are embracing AI faster than others. These include the following:

Technology. Tech firms of all types are adding AI to their products to enhance their use and make them simpler and more user-friendly. Hyperscalers, such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft, are all actively hiring AI specialists to build services.
Finance. The finance industry is making broad use of AI with simple tasks, such as automation, and more advanced uses, such as improving risk management and making better investment recommendations and decisions.
Healthcare. The healthcare industry is also rapidly embracing AI at all levels. On the low end, AI is being used for automation to avoid human error and for tasks such as billing and record management. On the high end, AI is being widely touted for early detection of serious illnesses, such as cancer, because the AI can spot signs that humans might miss.
Retail. The retail industry is making wide use of AI for operational efficiency. AI can be used for areas such as inventory management, loss prevention, trend spotting, more personal shopping experiences and fraud prevention by finding suspicious spending patterns or transactions.
Manufacturing. The manufacturing industry is embracing AI for operational efficiency. AI can spot early detection of potential equipment failure and help machinery run efficiently.
Cybersecurity. The cybersecurity market is embracing AI to monitor around the clock and avoid human error. AI applications can be programmed to detect unusual activity quickly for swift action.






10 top AI jobs
AI jobs are changing at a fast pace, just like technology. In 2024, specialists are more sought after than generalists. Deep knowledge of one aspect of AI is more valuable than shallow knowledge across many areas. Here are a few of the top AI jobs to check out.
1. AI product manager
An AI product manager is similar to other program managers. Both jobs require a team leader to develop and launch a product. In this case, it is an AI product, but it's not much different from any other product in terms of leading teams, scheduling and meeting milestones.
The technological demands of this job are a little higher than most product manager positions. AI product managers need to know what goes into making an AI application, including the hardware, programming languages, data sets and algorithms, so that they can make it available to their team. Creating an AI app is not the same as creating a web app. There are differences in the structure of the app and the development process.
2. AI research scientist
An AI research scientist is a computer scientist who studies and develops new AI algorithms and techniques. They develop and test new AI models, collaborate with other researchers, publish research papers and speak at conferences. Programming is only a small portion of what a research scientist does.
The tech industry is extremely open to self-taught and non-formally trained programmers, but it is an exception for AI research scientists. They need to have a strong understanding of computer science, mathematics and statistics. Typically, they need graduate degrees.
3. AI ethics specialist
As stated earlier, ethical use of data used in generating models is going to become a foremost concern in 2024. Dedicated specialists will be needed to ensure responsible development and deployment of AI. Companies might also look to add an AI ethics committee made up of employees with various experiences and specialties including lawyers, engineers, ethicists, public representatives and business strategists.
An AI ethics specialist will help develop ethical guidelines and policies for AI projects and complete ethical reviews of these projects. They might report any findings to the AI ethics committee. Skills needed for this position include critical thinking, effective communication and familiarity with AI frameworks and regulations.
4. Cybersecurity analyst with AI expertise
AI has found a home in cybersecurity, particularly in intrusion detection. However, the threat actors also use AI. This is a field where specialists are needed who are both fluent in cybersecurity and in the skill sets to use AI to combat things such as ransomware and intrusion detection.
5. Computer vision engineer
A computer vision engineer is a developer who specializes in writing programs that utilize visual input sensors, algorithms and systems. These systems see the world around them and act accordingly, such as self-driving and self-parking cars and facial recognition.
They use languages such as C++ and Python, along with visual sensors, such as Mobileye from Intel. Examples of use cases include object detection, image segmentation, facial recognition, gesture recognition and scenery understanding.
6. Data scientist
A data scientist is a technology professional who collects, analyzes and interprets data to solve problems and drive decision-making within the organization. They are not necessarily programmers, although many do write their own applications. Mostly, they use data mining, big data and analytical tools.
Their use of business insights derived from data enables businesses to improve sales and operations; make better decisions; and develop new products, services and policies. They use predictive modeling to forecast future events, such as customer churn and data visualization to display research results visually. Some also use machine learning to build models to automate these tasks.
7. Machine learning engineer
A machine learning engineer is responsible for developing and implementing machine learning training algorithms and models. Training is the demanding side of machine learning and is the most processor- and computation-intensive aspect of machine learning. Therefore, it requires the highest level of skill and training.
Because of the need for advanced math and statistics skills, most machine learning engineers have advanced degrees in computer science, math or statistics. They often continue training through certification programs or a master's degree in machine learning, deep learning or neural networks.
8. Natural language processing engineer
A natural language processing (NLP) engineer is a computer scientist who specializes in the development of algorithms and systems that understand and process natural human language input.
One of the big differentiators between traditional search engines and generative AI interfaces, such as ChatGPT, is that search engines use keywords and gather information from large amounts of existing online data. Generative AI creates new content based on other examples and patterns, and it answers queries in a chat-type format.
Like machine learning engineers, NLP engineers are not necessarily programmers first. They need to understand linguistics as much as they need to understand programming. NLP projects require machine translation, text summarization, answering questions and understanding context.
9. Robotics engineer
A robotics engineer is a developer who designs, develops and tests software for running and operating robots. Robotics has advanced significantly in recent years, such as automated home cleaners and precision cancer surgery equipment. Robotics engineers might also use AI and machine learning to boost a robotic system's performance.
As a result, robotics engineers are typically designing software that receives little to no human input but instead relies on sensory input. Therefore, a robotics engineer needs to debug the software and the hardware to make sure everything is functioning as it should.
Robotics engineers typically have degrees in engineering, such as electrical, electronic or mechanical engineering.
10. AI for healthcare specialist
If ever there was an industry that needed a bridge between the technological side and the professional side, it is healthcare. Technology can help doctors and patients alike in many ways, but it is also one of the most sensitive fields when it comes to data privacy.
AI offers several opportunities for helping the medical profession, such as diagnosing diseases and identifying the best treatment plans for patients with critical medical decisions. Another example of AI in healthcare is the AI-powered robotics in the operating room that assist with surgery.
AI jobs in healthcare require a deep understanding of medical conditions and terminology as much as it requires AI expertise.

What do we know about the future impact of AI on jobs? Nothing much, simply because we know nothing about the future, whether the next minute or the next ten years. This inconvenient truth has never stopped us—intelligent human beings—from making predictions, with or without the assistance of artificial intelligence, be it crystal balls, computers, statistical analysis, or economic models.


There has been no dearth of predictions regarding the impact of artificial intelligence on jobs since the business adoption of computers and the popularizing of the term “automation” in the early 1950s. More recently, the widespread popularity of “AI” has led to rampant speculation, mostly by academic researchers, about the possible elimination of many current occupations by increasingly smart machines, which some, mostly AI entrepreneurs, predict will match or surpass humans in the very near future.

The just-released MIT CSAIL Working Paper, “Beyond AI Exposure: Which Tasks are Cost-Effective to Automate with Computer Vision?” aims to set the record straight on predictions regarding AI and jobs. The good news? Only 23% of wages linked to vision-related tasks could be feasibly cost-effectively replaced by AI.

PROMOTED
“Anxieties about AI,” say the MIT researchers, result from the widespread use among academics attempting to measure the impact of AI of the notion of “AI Exposure”—the classification of occupational tasks by their “potential for automation.” The problem with this matching of AI capabilities with what’s required to perform a specific task is two-fold: No consideration of the “economic viability” of AI and conflating full automation and the resulting replacement of workers with partial automation which could result in work augmentation.

To address these shortcomings and construct what they call the “first end-to-end AI automation model,” the MIT researchers focused on vision-related tasks where the cost estimates for AI systems are more developed. The model evaluates the level of proficiency needed for a task based on surveys of the relevant workers, the cost of achieving that proficiency via human workers or AI systems (which are expensive to develop), and the economic decision by firms whether or not to adopt AI for a particular task.

Using the new and improved model, the MIT researchers found that “only 23% of worker compensation ‘exposed’ to AI computer vision would be cost-effective for firms to automate because of the large upfront costs of AI systems.” Lowering the cost of AI development and/or the cost of AI deployment (by increasing scale, possibly by using an AI-as-a-service platform), would lower these costs. However, “even with rapid decreases in cost of 20% per year, it would still take decades for computer vision tasks to become economically efficient for firms.”

The MIT researchers argue that their findings apply also to generative AI or the automation of language-related tasks. All areas of AI deployment require fine-tuning or customization “to adapt them to firm-specific characteristics,” a crucial cost factor and an obstacle for rapid adoption.

Another obstacle to adoption, not always considered by economists (and other prognosticators) is what another study calls “the societal acceptability of AI… Some professions may seamlessly integrate AI tools, while others could face resistance because of cultural, ethical, or operational concerns.”
That study was conducted by the International Monetary Fund and released to coincide with this year’s World Economic Forum in Davos, where AI was the major topic of discussion. Squarely in the research tradition the MIT paper criticized, the IMF study estimated that almost 40% of global employment is ”exposed” to AI. “In advanced economies,” says the IMF, “about 60% of jobs may be impacted by AI. Roughly half the exposed jobs may benefit from AI integration, enhancing productivity. For the other half, AI applications may execute key tasks currently performed by humans, which could lower labor demand, leading to lower wages and reduced hiring. In the most extreme cases, some of these jobs may disappear.”
Moving beyond economic models, another study released on the eve of the Davos meeting gathered data directly from the people in charge of creating and eliminating jobs. Accounting firm PwC conducted a survey of 4,700 CEOs in 105 countries and found that about a quarter of the CEOs expected the deployment of generative AI in their own businesses would lead to job cuts of at least 5% this year. Almost 75% predicted generative AI would significantly change their business in the next three years, requiring training employees in new skills, and managing new cybersecurity risks, misinformation, and bias towards specific groups of customers or employees.
The CEOs may have intuitively grasped (but not directly asked about) the “societal acceptability” of AI. As with any other new computer capability and functionality emerging over the last seven decades, the social factor is largely neglected in speculations about its impact on jobs and the nature of work.
In his commentary on the IMF study, Harry Law saw this as the “broader problem with this style of analysis.” Because of the problem of quantifying and assessing (my words) the “contextual, reputational, bureaucratic, and social elements of AI adoption,” what we have here is “more or less a guessing game.” It reminds Law, who happens to work at DeepMind, “of one of the core issues with model evaluations, which is that they are generally great at determining whether a model can do X but not so good at telling us how well a model does X in the real world.”
When you try to predict AI performance or its impact on jobs, the real world indeed disrupts the best models, AI or otherwise. The real world doesn’t follow expert predictions. Especially, when these predictions are about what people will do (or not do) with new technologies.
It was very difficult, maybe impossible, to predict the impact of PCs on the nature of work, how work will be organized, and how specific tasks will change. What all prognosticators missed was what managers would do with their new word processing, communicating, calculating machine.
Amazingly, they willingly took over some of the “dull” secretarial tasks that no self-respecting manager would deign to perform before the 1980s. The typing of memos (later emails), the filing of documents, the recording and calculating, a large part of the management of office information, previously exclusively in the hands of secretaries, became in the 1980s (and beyond) an integral part of the work of business executives. Why? Because now executives could do all of this “secretarial” work with a new “cool” tool, the PC, which conferred on them the leading-edge, high-status image of this new technology. What mattered was that you were important enough to have one of these cool things, not that you performed with it tasks that were considered beneath you just a few years before.

Customer service is proving to be one of the most popular applications of generative AI. But how exactly can generative AI aid customer service teams (without alienating customers)? And which companies are already making great use of generative AI? Read on to find out.


The Capabilities Of Generative AI
One of the obvious uses of generative AI is customer-facing chatbots. If you’ve ever had a frustrating interaction with a chatbot that is not particularly helpful, take heart because, with tools like ChatGPT, organizations can create chatbots that better understand customer queries and respond with much greater accuracy and nuance. They can also handle a large volume of queries efficiently and provide more personalized responses over time.

Traditional AI offerings (like some of the not-very-intelligent chatbots you might have interacted with) rely on rules-based systems to provide predetermined responses to questions. And when they come up against a query that they don’t recognize or don’t follow defined rules, they’re stuck. And even when they do give a helpful answer, the language is typically pretty stiff. But a tool like ChatGPT, on the other hand, can understand even complex questions and answer in a more natural, conversational way.

PROMOTED
In fact, ChatGPT is so good that UK energy supplier Octopus Energy has built conversational AI into its customer service channels and says that it is now responsible for handling inquiries. The bot reportedly does the work of 250 people and receives higher customer satisfaction ratings than human customer service agents. This is a prime example of how contact centers will increasingly incorporate generative AI chat and voice tools to deal with straightforward, easily repeatable tasks. And, of course, these tools give customers 24/7 access to support, 365 days a year, via multiple channels (such as phone, online chat, and social media messaging).

But answering customer questions isn’t the only way generative AI can add value in customer service. Some of the other tasks that generative AI can do or assist with include:
· Giving customers personalized recommendations based on the customer’s data and previous interactions further helps to enhance the customer experience.

· Providing conversational search functions for, say, FAQs online. Generative AI can take natural language prompts like “Where’s my package?” and either direct the customer to the correct FAQ response or deliver a tailored response. Plus, this can be done in multiple languages.

· Optimizing data to support customer service operations. Generative AI can handle vast amounts of data and turn that information into actionable insights – insights such as “Which are our most common complaints?” It can also track and categorize customer trends.

· Supporting human customer service agents. Generative AI can help human agents be more productive. For example, it can automatically generate responses to common queries, provide summaries of previous complaints and resolutions that agents can use in conversations, and generate product recommendations.
In this way, generative AI can support the work that human agents do and free them up to focus on more complex customer interactions where they can add the most value.
How John Hancock Has Boosted Its Customer Service With Conversational AI Tools
We’ve already seen how one company has improved its customer service function with generative AI. Now, let’s turn to another example. John Hancock, the US arm of global financial services provider Manulife, has been supporting customers for more than 160 years. But this doesn’t stop the life insurance company from embracing the latest technology.
The company has partnered with Microsoft to implement conversational AI tools, including Azure Bot Service, to provide support for common customer queries and issues. Like many companies, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, John Hancock contact centers saw a spike in calls, meaning the company needed new ways to help customers access the answers they needed. So they turned to Microsoft to help set up chatbot assistants that could handle general inquiries – thus reducing the total number of message center and phone inquiries and freeing up contact center employees.
In other words, this allows human contact center workers to focus their efforts on more complex cases – those calls that really require their expertise, as opposed to generic queries like “How do I reset my password?” As a result, team members enjoy a better work experience and more manageable workloads – while customers enjoy reduced wait times and a better service experience. As Tracy Kelly, AVP of contact center and LTC operations, puts it, “The call reduction due to chatbot innovation equates to impressive cost savings we’ve been able to reinvest in our customer contact centers…”
Plus, as an added bonus, the customer service team is being upskilled in valuable AI skills, thereby helping to future-proof their jobs.
It’s no wonder customer service has become CEOs’ number one generative AI priority, according to the IBM Institute for Business Value, with 85 percent of execs saying generative AI will be interacting directly with their customers within the next two years. Those companies that ignore the generative AI trend clearly risk being left behind.

In a powerful new survey conducted by Canva, a multi-purpose digital suite, and Sago, a quantitative research firm, nearly half of all job seekers today are using artificial intelligence (AI) tools to improve their résumés. As reported in Yahoo news, the survey included 5,000 hiring managers and 5, 000 job seekers from the US, UK, India, Germany, Spain, France, Mexico and Brazil. According to the results, 45% of job seekers have used generative AI to build, update or improve their résumés. But the really surprising statistic? Hiring managers are encouraging the use of AI for the creation of job search documents. Not surprisingly, in 2023, Canva’s AI-powered Magic Write tool for résumé template was used five million times. Grammarly has attracted 30 million users to its AI Resume Skills Generator. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.


Does HR Prefer AI-Generated Résumés?
For hiring managers, 90% say that it’s acceptable to use generative AI in application materials. Nearly half (44%) say that it’s OK to use AI to create any content related to the interview process. And a majority of hiring managers (67%) believe that they can tell when they are reading an AI-modified résumé.

But that last stat feels sort of like the number of people who feel that they are good drivers. Notice the difference: there’s how you feel about your driving, and there’s what I just experienced on the freeway. Perhaps our ability to spot AI is a little over-stated?

PROMOTED
At any rate, there’s a new résumé trend for 2024 emerging, and that’s the use of visual components. Nearly 60% of hiring managers prefer CVs (curriculum vitae, another way of saying résumé) with visual elements. In fact, 71% of respondents say that purely text-based résumés will be obsolete in five years.

Why It’s a Good Idea to Use AI for Your Résumé and CV
Amy Schultz, global head of talent acquisition at Canva, told FOX Business that candidates should feel reassured by this survey that they can continue to use AI as “a sort of great jumping off point.”

“We know that job seeking can be really hard, it can be really daunting, so if there’s something that can make you feel better about that experience, then I think that folks should lean into that,” she continued.

On average, this survey says that recruiters spend an average of just 7.4 seconds scanning a résumé. That’s generous, according to reports from CNBC. Simon Taylor, a former recruiter at Disney, says the number is more like three to five seconds. “Five is generous,” says Taylor, the author of the upcoming leadership book, Build Smart.

Artificial intelligence will change the nature of work in the coming years, interacting with demographics and remote work desire.

There is no one future of work that applies to all jobs, but for any specific job, the future depends on how important location is and how much AI will impact the tasks involved. But for all work, the ongoing tight labor market will loom large.


Demographics Of A Tight Labor Market
Today’s tight labor market comes not from pandemic-related changes but from long-standing demographic trends. Hiring new workers was difficult and unemployment was unusually low in 2018 and 2019, before the coronavirus arose. The problem was low growth of the working-age population. The change, from one census to the next, of the population aged 25 to 65 is currently the lowest since the Civil War! The history is shown in my article, “The Scariest Chart For Business In The Coming Decade: Workers Not Available,” published in 2018. Since that article was written, foreign immigration has proved lower than projected, pulling our working-age population projections down even lower than before.

The era of huge gains in working-age population, from 1970 through 2010, coincided with large increases in the female labor force participation rate. That accentuated the abundance of job-seekers. Since 2009, however, female interest in working has leveled off. So the labor force has been roughly stagnant.

PROMOTED
The demographics argue for a continuing tight labor market. That will ease—just a little—in the decade from 2030 to 2040. In the meantime, workers will be in short supply.

Remote Work In The Future
The Covid pandemic introduced many office workers to the possibility of remote work. Independent consultants and free-lancers had been working from home for years, but corporate employees had to work remotely during lockdowns. And many of them liked it. Some missed the comradery around the coffee pot and celebrating team members’ birthdays, but others felt relieved not to commute in. Some were more distracted without a boss looking on, but others concentrated more without hearing co-workers chatting in an open office or cube farm. The bottom line is that a significant number of office workers, but not all, want to work from home.
Managers have a different opinion: they believe remote workers accomplish less. A recent Harvard Business Review article highlighted managers’ lower estimates of remote work productivity than employees’ estimates. Also notable, though, is that nearly half of both employees and managers think productivity is about the same working remotely as in the office. Recently evidence arose of remote workers less likely to be promoted.

Forty years ago the managers would have won the battle. Job applicants were plentiful due to population growth and women entering the workforce. Today, though, the manager who insists on in-office work loses out on talented workers. Elon Musk had to walk back his hardcore office work policy at Twitter. Managers will balance their estimates of productivity versus the salaries needed to get people into the office. Remote work looked to be a major part of the future of work for office occupations. But what about . . .

AI And The Future Of Work
Now throw artificial intelligence into the mix. The impact will be different depending on whether the work is clerical and administrative or hands-on. For most office workers, generative AI, such as ChatGPT, will increase productivity, lowering the demand for such workers. The tight labor market for these occupations will not be so tight, and worker bargaining power will be lower. Wage growth in this sector will be slower, but the preference for remote work will remain. Managers who insist on office work will still have to pay up to get employees, but from a lower base. The managers who will make the best decisions will have solid data on productivity rather than gut feel and tradition. However, productivity is difficult to measure in many fields.
AI will have less impact on hands-on work: construction, stocking shelves, manufacturing, cooking and serving food, cleaning offices and hotels. Robotics have helped automate much factory work, but their limitations have become apparent. Speaking with several robotics engineers I learned that the machine learning techniques behind artificial intelligence require lots of data. That data is harder to acquire in the physical world. For example, robot welders in the automobile industry work on the exact same weld, in the exact same environment, time after time. The welder on a high-rise office project make different welds in varying temperature and wind conditions. The AI could help do the job—after it collects a million or so observations of actual work. Right now it seems that robotics development has plateaued, with the most talented computer scientists shifting to large language models. Robotics will probably achieve some breakthroughs in the future, but it’s hard to see a major revolution coming quickly.
AI I The Hands-On World
Artificial intelligence can certainly help with many parts of the hands-on world. Carpenters will still cut boards, but the contractor’s cost estimate and bill of materials will be created with the help of AI. The computer won’t cook a steak, but the AI can help figure out how many steaks diners will order tomorrow, reducing expensive waste.
AI, combined with sensors, can help get the right worker to the right place at the right time. Restrooms will still be cleaned by hand for many years to come, but they won’t sit dirty for long with good AI-driven monitoring systems. Potholes may be filled before they become large.
The Future Of Work Summary
The future of work will be very task-specific. Demand for hands-on workers will grow while supply won’t, pushing wages up and leading employers to offer better working conditions. Office roles will be assisted by specialized tools using artificial intelligence, reducing demand for such workers. The resulting equilibrium could entail falling wages, though greater productivity will lower consumer cost of living across the board. Remote work will become part of the wage bargain, with employers offering that option to keep their costs down.

They found that while computer vision AI is today capable of automating tasks that account for 1.6% of worker wages in the U.S. economy (excluding agriculture), only 23% of those wages (0.4% of the economy as a whole) would, at today’s costs, be cheaper for firms to automate instead of paying human workers. “Overall, our findings suggest that AI job displacement will be substantial, but also gradual—and therefore there is room for [government] policy and retraining to mitigate unemployment impacts,” the authors write.Tasks like analyzing images from diagnostic equipment in a hospital, or examining trays to ensure they contain the right items, are given in the paper as examples of the kind of “vision tasks” that today’s AI could feasibly achieve. But tasks like these are often so fragmented, the authors argue, that it is uneconomical to automate them.“Even though there is some change that is coming, there is also some time to adapt to it,” Neil Thompson, the study’s lead author, tells TIME. “It’s not going to happen so rapidly that everything is thrown into chaos right away.”Unless it does. The study only focused on computer vision AI—systems that are able to recognize and categorize objects in images and videos—rather than more flexible systems like multimodal large language models, of which OpenAI’s GPT-4 is an example. A recent study from OpenAI estimated that 19% of U.S. workers could see 50% of their workplace tasks “impacted” by GPT-4 level systems—a far higher estimate than the MIT researchers’ study that focuses solely on computer vision. A crucial question for the economy in the age of AI will be whether the MIT study’s findings apply to more “general” AI tools—ones that promise to automate most forms of cognitive labor that can be done behind a computer screen.The MIT researchers found it can be expensive for companies to “fine tune” computer vision systems to make them suited for a specific, specialized task. While such an investment may make economic sense for the largest companies, it is often not cheaper for a small outfit that could simply retain a trained worker who already performs the task well. This dynamic is a key reason, according to the MIT paper, that not all tasks AI is capable of doing today are also economically viable to replace humans in. (The paper, submitted to the journal Management Science, has not yet been peer-reviewed.)But it’s unclear whether this dynamic will carry over to language tasks. To “fine tune” a computer vision model to, for example, distinguish specific types of medicine bottle from one another to a 99.9% degree of accuracy, you would need to collect large quantities of labeled images of different medicines, which can be a costly and cumbersome process (even if low-wage workers in impoverished countries were drafted in to do it on the cheap). You would then have to pay the significant computing costs of fine-tuning an AI model on that large store of data.Read More: OpenAI Used Kenyan Workers on Less Than $2 Per Hour to Make ChatGPT Less ToxicOn the other hand, fine-tuning a cutting-edge language model to carry out a specific task can simply be a matter of giving it a detailed list of written rules. An OpenAI study from August last year found that GPT-4 was able to effectively carry out the task of content moderation on digital platforms after being fine-tuned using a detailed policy document and just a few labeled examples. Those findings suggest that large language models can be applied to a wide range of economic tasks far more quickly, and cheaply, than computer vision models.  Fine-tuning for GPT-4 is still in a restricted beta mode, as OpenAI works to mitigate the significant safety challenges this level of customizability can present. But as OpenAI and its competitors begin allowing customers to fine-tune their most advanced models, the economy may begin to see levels of automation, or augmentation, that progress faster than the MIT study predicts.“It is certainly plausible that customizing large language models may be easier than customizing computer vision systems and that this could lead to more adoption in the economy,” Thompson tells TIME. But, “so long as a small engineering team is needed to integrate the system into the company’s workflow, costs are still restrictive.”",,,,,https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/4QAoZP1p/poster.jpg?width=720,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023-12-15T20:34:28.000Z,PT5M13S,https://time.com/6565026/ai-job-replacement-mit-study/,"{'@type': 'SeekToAction', 'target': 'https://time.com/6565026/ai-job-replacement-mit-study/?jw_start={seek_to_second_number}', 'startOffset-input': 'required name=seek_to_second_number'}",https://cdn.jwplayer.com/manifests/4QAoZP1p.m3u8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What does generative AI mean for the legal sector?


Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT are entering law practices, promising more efficiency and less time spent on rote tasks. But risks remain around accuracy, ethics and privacy.

The legal sector has typically been characterized by a cautious, conservative approach to tech adoption. But emerging generative AI tools such as OpenAI's ChatGPT are quietly gaining traction among attorneys.







Although ChatGPT and other powerful large language models are relatively new, they've already seen surprisingly widespread adoption in the legal sector. More than 40% of attorneys surveyed by legal data and analytics company LexisNexis said they currently use or plan to use generative AI in their legal work, according to an August 2023 report.
""It's been probably the most interesting 12 months in my 20-year legal tech career,"" said Cheryl Wilson Griffin, CEO of Legal Tech Consultants, which advises law firms and other legal clients on technology issues.

The evolving role of generative AI in law
The term generative AI refers to sophisticated machine learning algorithms that can produce new content, such as text, images or code, after training on enormous amounts of data.
Generative AI's ability to create highly specific content in response to users' queries has piqued interest within the legal industry. In the aforementioned LexisNexis report, nearly all lawyers surveyed (89%) had heard of generative AI such as ChatGPT, and 41% had tried out a generative AI tool themselves. But historically, lawyers haven't always been quick to adopt new technologies.
Jake Heller is an attorney and CEO of legal AI company Casetext, acquired by Thomson Reuters in November 2023. He grew up in Silicon Valley and started coding at a young age. Upon becoming a lawyer, Heller found himself frustrated by the lackluster state of legal technology, particularly juxtaposed with consumer counterparts such as food delivery apps.
""It felt really imbalanced to me that the technology to support you for finding Thai restaurants was super good and the technology for saving businesses, saving people from prison and so on was so backwards and bad,"" he said.
Although legal still has something of a reputation for outdated systems and resistance to change, generative AI has been harder for the sector to ignore than other tech advancements of recent decades, such as cloud or big data analytics. The release of ChatGPT marked a significant shift in lawyers' attitudes toward AI -- something Heller described as a ""moment of awakening.""
""I think the thing that's been really interesting about this, and different than other technologies that have tried to disrupt or change legal, is that there's a consumer side,"" Griffin said.
Like Heller, Troy Doucet, founder of legal AI startup AI.law, found his way to legal tech through his background as an attorney. Law firms like Doucet's, which focuses on foreclosure defense and consumer protection, often feel pressure to maximize efficiency due to the economic challenges facing small firms.
When Doucet began exploring AI's ability to automate legal processes, he was initially interested in issue spotting -- determining whether a potential client's narrative gives rise to legal claims. Issue-spotting software for an employment attorney, for example, might analyze whether a set of facts supports a claim under the Fair Labor Standards Act.
Doucet began exploring this use case around the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, ultimately hiring an employee in a data role to help develop an AI product. What started as an efficiency tool within Doucet's firm gradually evolved into a broader project. But early on, his ambitions were hamstrung by technical limitations.
""It didn't turn out because the technology just wasn't there for it,"" Doucet said.
The advent of ChatGPT was a game-changer, however, Doucet said, enabling him to easily work with OpenAI's GPT models to perform issue spotting within his own firm. Down the line, as legal AI becomes more sophisticated, he believes such tools could revolutionize legal services: Increased efficiency would reduce legal costs, which in turn could expand access to justice.


The benefits of generative AI in law
Doucet's AI.law software and Casetext's flagship tool, CoCounsel, are positioned as AI legal assistants or colleagues, in line with the ""copilot"" approach taken in other disciplines. Overall, their creators say, the goal isn't to replace real legal professionals, but rather to delegate complex tasks, aiming to achieve faster and higher-quality outcomes.
The most time-consuming areas of litigation are, unsurprisingly, among the most appealing for automation. Griffin described discovery as the ""highest-risk, highest-reward"" area for introducing generative AI, and it's one of the areas Doucet targeted first with AI.law.
""Every partner gives junior associates the job of drafting discovery responses, because it's a very tedious and unenjoyable aspect of the job,"" Doucet said. ""We have that down to about two minutes from four to eight hours.""
Similarly, CoCounsel includes features, such as reviewing documents and editing contracts, that are particularly effective when lawyers need to review vast amounts of information quickly.
""Sometimes the things that get in the way of us doing more aren't the most important and pressing, highly strategic pieces,"" Heller said.
Instead, it's tiresome, repetitive tasks such as formatting citations and extracting relevant material from thousands of pages of documents. As an example, Heller described using an AI tool in an investigation to parse years' worth of emails, Slack messages and texts in a matter of days, as opposed to weeks or even months.
""The idea of reviewing millions of documents over a few days before this technology was kind of unthinkable,"" he said.
Griffin also pointed out that generative AI can help firms in areas that don't involve the direct practice of law, such as HR and operations. ""I think there's a lot of opportunity to automate some back-office stuff,"" she said. ""There's so much stuff that we're paying a lot of money for now because it's just wildly inefficient.""


Limitations of generative AI in law
Despite the various benefits of generative AI in law, actual adoption still appears to be lagging behind interest. There's often a ""difference between what [firms] are saying out loud and in PR, and what they're doing and actually what's happening in the real world,"" Griffin said. ""There's such a small percentage of firms that have actually bought or tried to implement anything.""
This is consistent with broader findings in the industry. August 2023 research from TechTarget's Enterprise Strategy Group found that 4% of organizations surveyed had implemented a mature generative AI initiative in production, though many more expressed interest in the technology or had explored it through pilot projects.



That hesitance isn't necessarily a bad thing, as buying generative AI tools without a clear plan for how they'll be used often ends in disappointment and disillusionment. Sometimes, Griffin said, her clients will find that they bought the tech without a problem for it to solve. Instead, she advises law firms to look at their needs first, then decide whether AI could meet those needs.
""From a best practice standpoint, always start with the problem first,"" she said. ""Don't just buy the tech and say, 'What can we do with it?' ... Make sure you have a plan before you buy.""
Moreover, generative AI still has notable limitations, particularly for complex areas such as litigation compared with formulaic tasks such as contract drafting. Griffin highlighted writing motions as an example of a less boilerplate task that remains difficult for generative AI to perform well.
""[Motions] are so much less standardized that it makes it really hard, I think, to develop a product that fills enough of the market's needs that people want to use it,"" she said.
Heller noted that there's a subset of tasks that humans currently perform much better than AI -- and perhaps always will. These include big-picture strategizing, such as deciding how to pursue a case or interpret a long history of business context, as well as interpersonal skills such as picking up on suspicious behavior in a key witness or speaking persuasively in the courtroom.
""If you think about what these AIs have been trained on, the data is what's on the internet,"" such as books and articles, Heller said. ""But anybody with real experience in law practice knows there's a lot you can't capture in a book. It comes through experience and training and observing.""


The issue of hallucinations
Accuracy is paramount in law practice and judicial decision-making. A document that includes hallucinations -- incorrect content output by a generative AI model -- could lead to misinterpretations of statutes, precedents or facts.
A model might easily come up with an explanation of a major Supreme Court case such as Brown v. Board of Education, a well-known decision about which there's extensive publicly available internet data. But a holding on a niche point of law from a specific district court is much less likely to be among the information the model has gradually memorized.
The problem is that LLMs are trained to predict the most statistically likely combination of words in response to a prompt, not to provide accurate factual information. This means that their tendency is to offer some response, even if the correct answer to a user's question isn't contained in their training data.
""There's always an incentive to answer,"" Heller said. ""[Generative AI models] are never going to say, 'I don't know.'""
More dangerously, generative AI models can be wrong while sounding very convincing. If taken at face value, hallucinations could potentially affect the outcome of legal cases. And if a judge realizes that an attorney has introduced AI-hallucinated content in a court filing, it could have serious consequences.
""If you're a lawyer and something bad happens, your licensure is on the line,"" Griffin said.
The ethical implications of using a tool that might generate false or misleading information are substantial, particularly in a legal context where every word can carry significant weight. Although it's not always clear who should be responsible for the inaccuracies in generative AI models' output, early examples suggest that lawyers could be on the hook.
In June 2023, a federal judge sanctioned attorneys Peter LoDuca and Steven Schwartz for relying on nonexistent case law invented by ChatGPT in a legal brief. Judge P. Kevin Castel of the Southern District of New York emphasized that the issue wasn't that the lawyers had used an AI tool; it was that they hadn't verified the AI-generated output and had failed to disclose their use of ChatGPT when the made-up cases were first identified.
""[T]here is nothing inherently improper about using a reliable artificial intelligence tool for assistance,"" Castel wrote in his order sanctioning LoDuca and Schwartz. ""But existing rules impose a gatekeeping role on attorneys to ensure the accuracy of their filings.""
It's also currently unclear how using AI tools that can hallucinate could affect compliance with laws and regulations. Attorneys must adhere to strict professional standards and regulations around handling and presentation of evidence as well as the accuracy of legal advice. At minimum, it's crucial to implement stringent validation and verification processes for AI-generated content in legal settings.


How legal professionals can integrate generative AI responsibly
One method for handling hallucinations is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), a technique in which LLMs can access data from external sources to improve the accuracy and relevance of their responses. Heller, whose Casetext software uses RAG, compared introducing RAG to switching from a closed-book to an open-book exam: With RAG, the model can look up information in real time that it wouldn't otherwise be able to access.
Although this helps ensure that AI responses are based on actual legal documents and case law, Heller cautioned that no AI tool is infallible. For example, even an AI tool using RAG could misinterpret a particularly dense, complicated text. In short, attorneys shouldn't assume that AI is more likely to be objective or correct than a person.
""Because we work with humans, we're used to working with imperfect beings,"" Heller said. ""This is one of them.""
More broadly, Doucet, Heller and Griffin all emphasized the growing importance of management skills for legal professionals working with AI. This goes beyond accuracy checks to combat hallucinations: Lawyers will need to learn how to effectively delegate, provide clear instructions and strategize using AI tools.
""Now, for the first time, everyone -- including your youngest associate and paralegal -- can have this AI assistant they can delegate tasks to,"" Heller said. ""But learning how to manage is actually really tough."" He pointed to skills that are familiar from managing human beings in the workplace, such as expressing instructions clearly, delegating tasks and giving useful feedback.


4 best practices for using generative AI in law
Although introducing generative AI into law practice carries certain risks, legal professionals can take steps to implement generative AI as responsibly and safely as possible.
1. Understand AI's capabilities and limitations
Before integrating AI into the day-to-day practice of law, it's essential to understand what AI can -- and just as importantly, can't -- do. Learning about the potential for errors, biases and hallucinations helps clarify where human oversight is needed.
2. Use AI to support, not replace, human workers
In its current state, generative AI is far from fully replacing a trained attorney or paralegal. Although AI is often useful for initial drafting, preliminary research and large-scale data analysis, AI-generated content should never go out without review. Keep final decisions and fact-checking in the hands of human experts.
3. Protect clients' data and privacy
Although AI regulation is a complicated, fast-evolving area, AI use is almost certainly covered by existing data privacy laws and client confidentiality agreements. Be cautious about what data is fed into AI systems, especially sensitive client information; for example, the consumer version of ChatGPT saves all data by default for retraining OpenAI's models.
""The key thing is understanding what [an AI model] is built on and understanding what you're trying to do with it, and then defining the risk around that in the same exact way you would with any other technology,"" Griffin said.
It's also important to be transparent with clients about how AI is used in their cases, including the potential benefits and risks. Make a plan for how to respond to clients' concerns about generative AI use, as not all clients will be comfortable with the use of such technology.
4. Learn about AI and stay up to date on the field
Stay informed about the latest developments in AI and their implications for law practice through online research and conversations with AI experts. Increasingly, bar associations are also offering AI education as part of professional development. Last fall, the New York City Bar Association hosted an Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning Summit for local attorneys that offered continuing legal education credits.
""In any revolution, there's job loss, but I think there's also an equal amount of opportunity created,"" Griffin said. ""Be the first one to learn it, and you'll be indispensable.""

Generative AI can empower advertisers from streamlining campaign creation to increasing the effectiveness of ads as the consumer Search experience evolves. Last year, we introduced a new era of AI-powered ads along with a commitment to ensuring advertisers have the opportunity to reach potential customers along their search journeys. Today, we’re sharing an update on our progress.




Building better Search campaigns through Gemini-powered chatAs we announced last month, Gemini, our largest and most capable AI model, will expand to more of our core products in the coming months, including Google Ads. We’ve been actively testing Gemini to further enhance our ads solutions. And, we’re pleased to share that Gemini is now powering the conversational experience. It’s the first of many Gemini integrations to come.Beta access to the conversational experience in Google Ads is now fully available to English language advertisers in the U.S. and U.K. It will begin rolling out globally to all English language advertisers over the next few weeks. We’re excited to open up access in additional languages in the months ahead and look forward to hearing your feedback.The conversational experience workflow is designed to help you build better Search campaigns through a chat-based experience. It combines your expertise with Google AI. All you need to start is your website URL and Google AI will help you create optimized Search campaigns by generating relevant ad content, including creatives and keywords.Over the last few months, we’ve been testing the conversational experience with a small group of advertisers. We observed that it helps them build higher quality Search campaigns with less effort. One of the ways we measure this is with a metric called Ad Strength that looks at the relevance, quality and diversity of your ad copy and gives you a score from “Poor” all the way up to “Excellent.”





I found the conversational experience very easy to use. It helped me create even more high-quality ads with ‘Good’ or ‘Excellent’ Ad Strength, which has further improved the performance of my campaigns.

As Search becomes more visual, we’ve heard advertisers tell us that it can be challenging to create compelling images that drive performance. That’s why we designed the conversational experience to suggest images tailored to your campaign using generative AI and images from your landing page. This capability will be added over the coming months. Advertisers approve assets — including images — before the campaign goes live.All images created with generative AI in Google Ads, including the conversational experience, will be identified as such. We’re using SynthID to invisibly watermark these images and they will include open standard metadata to indicate the image was generated by AI.

Chat your way into better performance with the conversational experience in Google Ads



Our data shows that small business advertisers that use the conversational experience in Google Ads are 42% more likely to publish Search campaigns with “Good” or “Excellent” Ad Strength.1 This is significant because we’ve found a strong correlation between Ad Strength and conversions. For example, advertisers who improve Ad Strength for their responsive search ads from “Poor” to “Excellent” see 12% more conversions on average.2




Taking a bold and responsible AI approachWe share the industry’s enthusiasm for AI’s potential to unlock value for consumers and advertisers alike. New use cases — and opportunities — are emerging on a regular basis as AI continues to evolve quickly. And that’s why we think AI will continue to make our products even more useful.As we continue to explore what’s possible with AI, we remain committed to developing and applying this new technology responsibly. We believe the best way to do this is by upholding our AI principles that we established in 2018.Stay tuned for more AI-powered updates to Google Ads in the year ahead.

Nearly Half of Job Seekers Using AIArtificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the way we work, and the realm of recruitment is no exception. Crafting the perfect CV is an arduous task for many, therefore it’s no surprise job seekers are welcoming the host of free and paid AI-powered resume tools which take the heavy lifting out of the task.The online graphic design platform, Canva teamed up with research company, Sago, to survey 5,000 hiring managers and 5,000 job seekers to uncover the latest trends in both job seeking and candidate hiring.The headline finding from the survey was that 45% of job seeker respondents said they had used generative AI to build, update or improve their CV.The survey respondents came from the U.S., United Kingdom, India, Germany, Spain, France, Mexico and Brazil, with job candidates in India utilising AI to bolster their resume the most (74%) followed by Brazil (50%), in France and Spain however, job seekers preferred good old fashioned methods, with their AI uptake sitting in the low-to-mid thirties. Hiring Managers Actually Like AI-Enhanced CVsIt may feel counterintuitive to the popular belief that using AI to build your CV is in some way cheating, the survey found that a staggering 90% of hiring manager respondents said it is acceptable to use generative AI in application materials.Of those hiring managers surveyed 46% said it should be used minimally to augment an applicant’s ideas and content, and 44% said it can be used to create any content.🔎 Want to browse the web privately? 🌎 Or appear as if you're in another country?Get a huge 86% off Surfshark with this special tech.co offer. What’s more, 57% of all hiring managers prefer CVs with visual components rather than text-only CVs, with 71% of respondents saying the latter will be obsolete within five years.Amy Schultz, global head of talent acquisition at Canva, told Fox Business that candidates should feel reassured by this survey that they can continue to use AI as “a sort of great jumping off point.”“We know that job seeking can be really hard, it can be really daunting, so if there’s something that can make you feel better about that experience, then I think that folks should lean into that,” she continued.Can Hiring Managers Detect AI Created CVs?One question that comes to mind is whether or not it’s obvious to recruiters when candidates have used AI to enhance their CV.The survey found that an overwhelming majority (67%) of hiring managers believe they can tell most or all of the time when they are reading an AI-modified resume.Whilst Schultz was positive about the benefits for both candidates and recruiters using AI, she did caveat that candidates should always proofread what AI resume tools output to ensure it’s correct and inline with their tone of voice and experience.Make it Stand Out: Hot Tips for CandidatesSchultz said that recruiters spend an average of just 7.4 seconds scanning at CV before deciding whether or not to spend time reading it in more detail. For candidates that means that their CV must grab the hiring manager’s attention visually right away to give themselves a higher chance of making the shortlist.AI Resume Builder TipsA virtual graphic designer for everyoneWhilst it’s possible to design an attractive resume without the use of artificial intelligence, it’s certainly much more time consuming and the results are likely not going to be as polished unless you’re a graphic designer! Using an AI tool to do this part will save significant time and will lay out your content in the most visually appealing way that will get more eyeballs on your actual experience.Keyword optimization is essentialAs AI becomes an integral part of the hiring process, many HR teams are also turning to AI to sift through CVs and find the most relevant candidates. Therefore it’s vital that your CV encapsulates the keyword and terminology that are present on the job listing. This will often occur naturally however, an AI tool will save you time fine-tuning the language and technical terms used in each job description and tailor your application to each position, giving you a higher chance of actually getting your CV in front of a human.Embrace but don’t replace AI can be a valuable asset, but it’s crucial to remember that your resume is a representation of you. Proofread any AI-generated content carefully to ensure accuracy and authenticity. Personalise your resume so it showcases your unique value proposition and your personality and maybe think again before using it for the cover letter as well.

Watch to hear Merrin Mueller from RPM Pizza discuss how text messaging and chatbots can improve the recruitment process. 

Mueller works in the food industry, an industry that already faces high turnover. She recalls how her business decided to use TextRecruit, a service that reaches out to candidates via text message. 

Mueller also explains how her HR team utilized a chatbot named Dottie to interact with applicants via text. After some training, 'Dottie' became the official recruiter face of RPM Pizza. She was not only able to interact with possible candidates, but also conduct pre-screenings to narrow down the pool. AI-based HR technology like 'Dottie' can drive efficiency and ease the recruiting process.

Top AI recruiting tools and software of 2024


AI is infiltrating every corner of recruiting and talent acquisition. Here's how to evaluate AI tools, and 13 that merit serious consideration.

AI is everywhere. According to a 2023 survey by HR software vendor Engagedly, AI adoption is growing rapidly, automating repetitive tasks and improving decision-making processes as well as the overall employee experience. In the survey, 81% of HR leaders have explored or implemented AI to improve process efficiency in their organizations while around 45% of HR professionals are using AI for HR management and 39% plan to use it in the near future. Nearly two-thirds of respondents said AI has greatly improved efficiency and productivity in HR.







Buyers have every right to be confused. In recruiting alone, there are well over 100 AI-based talent acquisition products in the market. AI now underlies at least part of the familiar names in talent acquisition -- for example, ICIMS, Oracle Recruiting Cloud and Workday -- as well as smaller relative newcomers, such as Onwelo's Hello Astra, Wade & Wendy, CVViZ, Findem, AmazingHiring and Manatal.
To a certain extent, AI-based recruiting products are more similar than different. A buyer is likely able to successfully source, engage, screen, hire and onboard job candidates with almost any of the popular systems, and most provide personalization capabilities, chatbots and sophisticated content creation tools. AI provides the ability to search more widely across many more sources of candidates than humans have time for, creating talent pools that are more diverse. AI can match and rank candidates to requisitions in an instant as well as search the employee population for internal candidates.
In addition, candidate engagement is improved by intelligent chatbots, which are often able to understand spoken input as well as text -- and by the newfound ease of customization from using AI for correspondence.

Of the 172 HR practitioners who responded to IDC's November 2022 AIPath survey, 32% named candidate matching and selection as the top AI use case for their organization. Respondents reported that when used for recruiting, AI immediately made HR's job easier, provided good insights and improved the employee experience. It also streamlined tasks and made the manager's job easier, resulting in greater efficiency, fewer steps and reduced operating costs.
Also of interest, however, is how quickly AI has spread from recruiting platforms to broader-use talent management platforms. Now, AI goes beyond focusing on ascertaining skills in initial hiring to identify skill gaps and recommend solutions, thus facilitating employees' career development. Today's most competitive AI-based applicant tracking systems (ATSes) have crossed that barrier into post-hiring skill identification and development, a promising aid to internal mobility, succession planning, and ultimately, employee retention.

Engaging engagement
Generative AI is a breakout product that has made significant headway this year, especially in areas of great use to recruiters, such as candidate engagement. With the ChatGPT bot as its poster child, generative AI excels at content creation, whether it be text, images, artwork or even videos. This is proving a godsend to both recruiters and hiring managers, who can use the technology to make job reqs more appealing, more easily customize candidate communication, and personalize job-offer and rejection letters.
Generative AI is both a time saver for recruiters and a source of inspiration for anyone seeking a kickstart to creating compelling prose, be it for formal communication, email, chatbot or text correspondence. Uses are not limited to candidate communication, however. Today's AI-based applications can generate customized pre-screening questions as well as interview guides focused on the position and candidate in question.
The key here, as always, is that human input, monitoring and sometimes intervention are required. Other AI applications are more specific and intended to augment the functionality in a traditional ATS. Examples include Eightfold AI for skills and insights; Fuel50 for workforce mobility and talent management; VONQ for branded recruitment marketing; HiredScore, which has a strong focus on compliance and ethics; and Textio, which provides language guidance for inclusive and diverse hiring.
Some products are more tailored to specific industries. HireEZ (formerly Hiretual), for example, targets healthcare and technology professionals, and stores data on relationships of people and places. Staffing Engine is designed for use by staffing firms, while Codility and HackerRank (hardly a newcomer) are used to objectively assess software developer skills.



Performance reviews and recruiting are two of the more common early applications of generative AI in HR.







Using chatbots for recruiting is now mainstream
Conversational chatbots were early common applications of AI in talent acquisition products. Widely available for mobile devices, career sites and sometimes smartwatches, bots are increasingly relied upon to get potential candidates the focused information they need and walk them through job discovery, the application and often the onboarding process.
Chatbots, such as Paradox's Olivia, Eightfold AI's Amy and StepStone's Mya are increasingly sophisticated and friendly. Most bots can help navigate career sites, bringing pertinent jobs to the site visitor, and assist in the application process. They then manage interview scheduling, calendar coordination and sending reminders to relevant parties.
AI-based sourcing products -- Arya by Leoforce is one example -- provide a consolidated candidate communication dashboard, an essential tool for engaging and keeping track of voice, text, email and chatbot conversations. This capability is important because too often, candidate communication is lost in Post-it notes.
Using AI to funnel the most likely candidates to recruiters has become universal, without the biases surrounding age, gender, religion, race or ethnicity. This basic source, post, search, parse and match capability underlies all the talent acquisition products reviewed here and the majority in the market.


How is AI used in recruiting?
AI technology can look like old-fashioned search on steroids, and indeed, AI-enabled sourcing software can locate, deliver and filter huge volumes of data -- but more rapidly and accurately than ever before possible. Referred to as traditional AI by some, this data-provision capability is different from the generative AI that has been top of mind in the past year. Generative AI (ChatGPT is just one example) is the kind that is so useful in creating job descriptions and personalized correspondence.
It is important to understand how the engines work. To provide Day One value, the vendor has to have done extensive back-end work to avoid a cold start for the customer.
From the millions of records from which the engine learns, the vendor will create a model that will need to be validated repeatedly to ensure accurate results. This pretrained model and companion language-processing software ""know"" how to use a customer's own data to build a model tailored to that customer. More importantly, buyers need to understand that the model will continue to learn through their curation, use and periodic ingestion of new data -- hence the machine learning aspect -- to ensure relevancy, accuracy and freshness over time. Buyers should evaluate a vendor's ongoing support capabilities for that effort.
Vendors love to boast about the huge number of records their engine has ingested, records gleaned from many sources and of varying types. This is fodder for the engine, the substance from which it learns and from which a workable model is created. The real value of all this is in the relevance of the output, be it recommended candidates, suggested coursework or career paths.
In some cases, though, vendors can deliver pools of talent to the buyer. This is a different matter. The number referred to previously relates to the volume of data that the engine ingested to build a reliable model for the task at hand. The second is basically a virtual data lake of potential candidates available to the buyer, filtered by the trained AI engine, which avoids the Day One problem.
The continual ingestion of new records requires that the vendor assist with ongoing data curation and algorithm checks to guard against drifts into irrelevancy or inaccuracy.


But will it integrate?
Challenges in integrating diverse products always haunt buyers. Perhaps the closest thing to good news on this front is that the code for AI engines, while not standardized, is generally very similar from engine to engine. The products included here all claim to integrate with ATSes, and many offer bidirectional integration (Eightfold AI, for one). Some companies rely on partners to augment their systems. SAP SuccessFactors Recruiting integrates with Eightfold AI, Paradox's Olivia, Skillate and JobHopin, for example. These products add AI support to the core recruiting system for areas such as intelligent matching and shortlisting, salary information, chatbots and candidate ranking.



AI brings major benefits to recruiting but also carries significant risk.







Introduction to AI recruiting tools
There are many ways to evaluate products and vendors: breadth or depth of functionality provided, technology used, price, global availability, the software's sophistication, the degrees of support and training provided, the vendor's reputation for integrity or eco-consciousness and no doubt others. Here, products that rose to the top are considered; some are total ATSes and some are talent augmenting systems.
The products reviewed in this section tend to address the needs of at least three distinct user groups: candidates, recruiters and hiring managers, and often already-hired employees. The ATSes in general all support sourcing, job posting, data parsing, candidate shortlisting or ranking, multichannel communications, career site and mobile device chatbots, and intuitive UIs geared to the needs of the candidate, hiring manager and recruiter. All deliver analytics relevant to their product scope. They also provide bot-supported scheduling of interviews and follow-up conversations, a great boon to both candidates and recruiters. Several have extended their capabilities to current employees to meet the growing demand for career growth and mobility.
Serious buyers of new AI-powered recruiting software should not neglect products from longstanding vendors such as Oracle, ICIMS and Workday. These companies are deeply vested in recruiting and talent management expertise and have the support teams, cloud infrastructure, secure platforms and deep pockets startups generally lack. While startups are still in the early stages of their product releases, these older companies have developed and refined their AI software and support for customer initiatives. They also offer more complete products, reflecting their time in the market. Many of the products reviewed here, in fact, augment rather than replace products from these established firms. A further consideration when buying AI-powered recruiting tools is vendor longevity: Will your chosen vendor be acquired by another right in the middle of your implementation?
The goal here is not to cover every feature or function; the vendors' websites have product briefs with that information. Again, because the requirements of the recruitment process are clearly defined, the products are more similar than different. Therefore, points of uniqueness or specific strengths form the basis of differentiating the vendors here, in alphabetical order, not ranked.


Arya by Leoforce
The vendor claims ""Arya goes beyond conventional AI with artificial intuition, a deeper, multidimensional understanding of people, jobs and what makes them compatible,"" but doesn't say how the product does this. (Perhaps a clue is in the name: ""Arya"" means illustrious or spiritual in Sanskrit.)
Arya uses AI to source from internal databases, job boards and social networks, and provides one-click job ad placement, as do most similar products. Recruiters can engage with potential applicants via phone, text, email and bots from one integrated candidate communication dashboard. This desirable feature supports automation of personalized messages and streamlines communication throughout the entire process to facilitate contact with candidates. ATS integration is supported.
New in 2023 is a score details feature that delivers an explanation and analysis of a candidate's resume along with the overall score the system used for ranking suitability for a particular position, and Scouting Agent, an AI-driven search tool that can update candidate profiles every 24 hours. This followed the release of Candidate 360, a feature for recruiters that purports to provide a 360-degree view of a candidate's professional journey.
Arya includes candidate relationship marketing in its support for drip campaigns, a series of automated emails sent to candidates who take certain actions on a website. It can track the number of emails sent, opened, unopened and clicked, and supports one-to-one or one-to-many communication via email, text and direct dial -- features some ATSes don't have.
There are four versions. With Arya Quantum, Leoforce notably adds neurodiversity to its bias mitigation list. This should be a call-out capability in all talent acquisition products.
The Arya Pulse service provides agency-quality candidates without high staffing agency fees or long-term contracts. The cost can be as low as $599 per job to get a list of interview-ready candidates.
Another service, which signals that Leoforce is more than a software vendor, is Arya Concierge, in which the customer works with one dedicated recruiter expertly trained in using Arya to find highly compatible job candidates. Leoforce then engages with and qualifies the most compatible candidates, adding more of a traditional headhunter service to the offerings. The customer also receives all the qualified profiles Arya sourced, for future recruiting.


ICIMS Talent Cloud
ICIMS Talent Cloud deploys its AI engine to search for, opportunity match and recommend potential job candidates. Its conversational AI bot enables candidates to receive answers to FAQs, learn from employee-generated videos and schedule interviews in over 20 languages. In an attempt to make recruiter-relevant use of what may be sparse data, the digital assistant can parse an applicant's resume, creating a dynamic talent profile augmented with publicly available third-party information from external systems such as LinkedIn, if the customer has a partnership with the source, or from core HR systems. It then infers related adjacent skills the applicant may not have noted explicitly. The digital assistant integrates with communication platforms such as SMS text messaging, web chat, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Microsoft Teams.
The product's intelligent search for career sites can deliver positions for applicants to consider that otherwise might not appear due to inconsistencies in spelling, acronyms or job titles. When applicants upload their resumes, Talent Cloud's AI recommends roles that align with their skills and experience.
ICIMS Talent Cloud offers the full set of recruiting and hiring analytics in an intuitive dashboard, updated regularly. Research by Apps Run the World in 2022 reported ICIMS as having the largest market share of any single ATS vendor. Oracle was second and Workday third.


Oracle Recruiting
For organizations using Oracle Cloud HCM for core HR, this closely integrated recruiting product makes sense. Thanks to its long time in the market and experience in hiring-management applications, Oracle provides sophisticated breadth and depth to address candidate relationship management and hiring management. It also applies a wealth of experience in UI creation, outshining some newer market entrants. Both traditional and generative AI span the Oracle human capital management (HCM) products, with examples as follows:
Recruiting

Job postings. Generative AI helps create engaging job descriptions that convey a position's requirements and success criteria.
Candidate recommendations. AI intelligent matching helps identify and recommend the best applicants for open positions, rank applicants and find similar candidates.
Time-to-hire prediction. AI-based predictive modeling benchmarks and predicts how long it will take to fill a job based on past hires.
Candidate summaries. Generative AI helps produce a concise summary that describes a candidate's best-fit capabilities and attributes for a position.

Skills growth and career development

Knowledge management. Generative AI creates knowledgebase articles to answer frequently asked questions.

Across all its AI-enhanced products, Oracle ensures that no personally identifiable information is ingested or displayed, the platform never publishes data out of the customer's HR system and all sensitive and proprietary information is protected.


Phenom Intelligent Talent Experience
Phenom goes beyond recruiting to follow-on talent management that includes employee career pathing and support for internal mobility. The company uses ""job zones"" as defined by the Occupational Information Network to group jobs based on the level of preparation required, such as education, training and experience, on a scale of 1 to 5.

Zones 1 and 2 include jobs like cashiers and drivers. The focus is on automation, giving organizations the ability to dictate where in the hiring process tasks should be automated to allow the recruiter and manager to focus on more value-adding activities. A high-volume hiring feature allows companies to engage candidates via chatbot, letting them search for jobs, apply, complete an assessment, submit a video and schedule an interview without interacting with recruiters. The assessment feature is a newer addition built by Phenom's industrial-organizational psychologists to succinctly capture the qualifications needed for frontline jobs in several industries.
Zone 3 roles require medium preparedness, with some education and certifications such as for electricians and medical assistants.
For zones 4 and 5, candidates need more engagement during their job search, while recruiters and managers require more AI-driven analysis during the interview process.

To improve the candidate experience, Phenom Talent Companion employs an AI chatbot that creates a streamlined but highly personalized engagement with knowledge worker candidates to find relevant jobs and get them through the application process faster.
Post-application, Interview Intelligence provides a centralized location for the hiring team to evaluate potential hires. Interviewers are provided with an AI summary of the interview, highlighting areas of interest based on the job requirements, as well as potential biases of the interviewer.
The AI assistant, Phenom X+, helps generate interview guides for keeping interviewers on track and avoiding bias or potentially illegal questions. X+ also enables recruiting teams to improve efficiency by automating repetitive tasks like scheduling interviews, adding notes to candidate profiles, drafting individual emails and generating job descriptions.
Phenom also provides customers with the tools they need to grow and retain hires. Skills are central to the technology that drives the entire platform, and they are especially relevant to Phenom's workforce intelligence system. This holistic suite of products is meant to engage employees and managers in talent management to facilitate personalized talent development, mentorships and internal mobility. With a skills ontology almost 15 years in the making, workforce intelligence makes it easy for HR to identify and fill skills gaps, managers to designate successors and promote career progression, and employees to gain visibility into opportunities that might help them excel in the organization.



Phenom's talent analytics shows metrics such as the number of candidates in the hiring pipeline and comparisons of recruitment marketing campaigns.





All of this ties back to talent acquisition activities as well, letting recruiters employ skills technology to quickly find the best fit for an open role, whether inside or outside the organization. The AI does the heavy lifting but keeps the human in the loop by letting recruiters and managers incorporate their needs when a role opens.


Skillate
Skillate is now part of Sense, which makes AI talent engagement software for recruiting that targets the staffing industry. Skillate provides an AI-powered matching engine, chatbot screening, resume parsing and automatic interview scheduling.
Skillate starts with writing the job description itself, offering assistance by suggesting better keywords and skills. It provides the resume-to-req matching and resume parsing that are the basis of all the products reviewed here. The product collects resumes from potential sources -- such as its internal database, third-party ATSes, Google Drive, mailboxes, referrals, external agencies and career pages -- and runs incoming resumes against its machine learning model, ranking and scoring them for their fit with the job at hand. Skillate reports its AI algorithms have been trained with a data set of 120 million profiles.
First-round screening is AI-enabled here: The chatbot automatically screens the candidates for information beyond resumes, such as notice periods, intent to relocate and salary expectations.
Skillate integrates with SAP SuccessFactors Recruiting, Workday, SmartRecruiters, and Oracle Taleo.


TurboHire
TurboHire bills itself as a recruitment automation platform, adding AI to the tasks all recruiters face: job marketing and screening, interview scheduling, feedback collection, and candidate engagement and inquiry. It accommodates global and high-volume hiring through bulk email campaigns and WhatsApp and text integration. Like in other products reviewed here, customizing is possible without touching code, so recruiters can adapt it for their preferred practices. The software has an integrated agency-management portal that enables partners to contribute candidates, track their status and manage compliance, which is key to recruiting in much of Asia.
TurboHire has AI-enabled many of the standard workflows of recruiting and hiring, delivered in a series of modules. Like most such products, the focus is on productivity and efficiency. The company claims to have automated 85% of manual recruiting activities. Its platform integrates with solutions from companies such as Oracle and SAP SuccessFactors. Single sign-on is accommodated with Microsoft Office 365 and Google Workspace.





AI in talent sourcing
Locating potential employees, especially passive candidates, is its own challenge. Products that use AI in sourcing have the advantage of searching huge and widespread sources of talent almost instantly. While this kind of AI is part of most ATSes, some products that augment ATSes are worth calling out. As the first product offerings from their respective vendors, these may grow into full-fledged ATSes over time, be acquired and added to an ATS player's product, or remain as a separate tool for at least the short term.


Fetcher
If there were a reward for clever product names, Fetcher might win because it does just that: fetches potential applicants. Fetcher is a candidate sourcing and scheduling tool with the recruiting analytics buyers expect. Used by small businesses with English-only needs, it identifies candidates based on AI-powered keyword matches. Over time, it learns a company's candidate preferences and then identifies potential talent accordingly.
The platform automates the standard requirements for email outreach campaigns, provides a duplication option to reuse previous search criteria and has a notes feature for recruiter feedback. The information provided is piped directly to the vendor's internal teams, to further tailor the search, enhance the algorithms and help Fetcher find and deliver the candidates sought. The scheduling plugin allows for rapid company-branded scheduling of telephone screens and interviews.
While the sourcing functions of this product are not unique, it is nonetheless an intuitive tool for recruiters in small businesses. It integrates out of the box with Ashby, Fountain, Greenhouse, Lever, JazzHR, Oracle Taleo, Recruitee, SAP SuccessFactors Recruiting, SmartRecruiters and Teamtailor.


SeekOut
SeekOut provides an AI-powered talent search engine to help recruiters quickly find and hire the most qualified passive candidates. It appears to be Boolean-based, a potentially limiting approach that can be hard to use. The company says it provides access to hundreds of millions of candidates from potentially untapped talent pools, including public profiles, GitHub, the papers and patents of experts, employee referrals, company alumni and candidates already in the organization's ATS. There are more than 100 searchable fields that include skill sets, background, experience, education and diversity, as well as fields such as security clearance, which is useful for U.S. federal government positions. A healthcare talent pool, for example, includes 5.5 million healthcare professionals. In all, the company claims to have over 800 million public profiles, 330 million of which are underrepresented candidates.
SeekOut supports the concept of a total talent pool as well as individuals. Recruiters can see total amalgamated talent by location and specific people with that talent in that location. This is a potentially valuable feature many other platforms lack.
SeekOut's ability to locate and screen tech talent should be a draw for organizations that need technologists. From GitHub, the app can provide and review actual code to better evaluate a potential applicant's technical prowess. It appears to be easy and intuitive to use, albeit with a slightly underwhelming UI for people accustomed to today's glitzier applications, and is definitely worth considering.


XOR AI Recruiter
Much of the recruiting industry focuses on white-collar and professional hiring and only adds large-volume hiring as an afterthought, often glossing over this important employee segment. Addressing this, XOR says it provides a digital recruiting assistant that enables its platform to deliver blue-collar workers for only $500 a hire in less than five days.
XOR AI Recruiter employs the natural language processing (NLP) capabilities of ChatGPT to provide a conversational recruiter chatbot and consolidated communication platform with tools for text messaging, WhatsApp, live chat, phone calls and video to drive engagement. It uses the AI chatbots to automate repetitive tasks such as screening, scheduling, reengagement, onboarding and rehiring. Availability in more than 100 languages enhances its use for multinational corporations -- for example, Ikea is a customer.
It offers bidirectional integration with several prominent ATS systems. XOR sources candidates from job boards, text conversations, career sites, the ATS itself and, with added extensions, other websites.
XOR AI Recruiter is more of an automated service than a purchasable product. In addition to targeted digital marketing for advertising campaigns and virtual career fairs, the vendor uses nonconventional sourcing channels, such as multilevel referral programs, and relies on influencers in local communities to spread the word about hot job openings and motivate candidates to apply. The XOR system then connects and interacts with the candidate directly rather than through job boards.
Similar to the functionality of other products discussed here, once recruiters select the essential requirements for candidates, XOR AI Recruiter will screen them, assign scores and automatically schedule and remind them about their upcoming interview.


Skills-based talent decisions for today and tomorrow
Few areas are getting more attention from business executives than skills. It's the ground zero of talent management, and fears about the skills gap are deep-seated. The pandemic didn't help, as many companies failed to use the time to upskill employees. The supposed Great Resignation (the baby-boom generation retiring), the perception that high school and college graduates lack necessary skills, and the advent of new technologies that require new, different and often sophisticated skills have all contributed to a skill malaise. Reskilling has been a hot topic, but little evidence of widespread results has been forthcoming.
The issue is longstanding. Traditional HR systems of record have disparate data about each candidate and employee that is often fragmented across systems and self-reported based on each person's recollection of what they accomplished. It never encapsulates the depth and breadth of what they have done -- and most certainly does not yield insight into their potential. Businesses know frightfully little about the skills their employees really have, and often even the exact skills the business needs.
Here are two noteworthy products, among many in the market, that use AI in ascertaining and improving skills.


Eightfold AI Talent Intelligence suite
Eightfold calls its product a talent intelligence platform that enables ""holistic"" talent strategies, and it could be among the first of an emerging product category. Eightfold has a proprietary global data set of more than 1.5 billion talent profiles from which its AI generates recommendations to help employers decide how and when to build, buy or borrow talent. It employs a skills-based framework that matches people to opportunities, including full-time, part-time, project and gig work. Eightfold uses that data to understand the availability, maturity, relevance, learnability and evolution of skills in specific organizations and throughout the global market.
Eightfold's Job Intelligence Engine powers skills-based talent decisions about the job requirements needed for every role in an organization. This skills-based approach drives decision-making around upskilling, reskilling, hiring, staffing of contractors and attaining diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) goals. Additionally, the job intelligence engine examines skill adjacency and context to determine future capabilities and needs as organizations grow. The platform also enables self-learning, data-driven updates that help to ensure consistent, unbiased evaluations of individual capabilities and ability to learn against globally standardized job descriptions and requirements.
One of the products in the Eightfold platform, Eightfold Talent Management, is available in more than 24 languages. Employees can use it to find reskilling and upskilling opportunities across courses, mentors and projects based on current skills and career aspirations. The goal of people developing their own skills and assuming responsibility for their career growth is addressed through curated opportunities for continuous learning. By using Eightfold, organizations can better understand the potential of their workforce on a global scale and guide individual employees to further learning, skill development and career opportunities.
Eightfold integrates with Workday, SAP SuccessFactors Recruiting, Oracle Taleo, Oracle Recruiting Cloud, Greenhouse and others.


Fuel50
Most of the products that play a part in recruiting begin with the job or role. Fuel50 turns that premise on its head, looking first at the skills across the organization and how to better position them. This requires reviewing every job description and updating it with the talents and skills needed for each role, rather than the degrees, years of experience and certifications required. Fuel50 helps people identify their talents and skills and supports their growth with career development actions, feedback and learning. The result is not just internal talent mobility but also workforce agility.
A woman-owned company founded by Anne Fulton, Fuel50 provides an AI-driven talent marketplace that also fuels engagement and employee retention with global coverage. Its tool helps organizations understand their bench strength, build talent pipelines, predict skills shortages and conduct workforce mapping.
Fuel50's AI architecture uses validated career frameworks to fast-track the rebuilding of an organization's career framework to eliminate the manual process of creating and maintaining job profiles, which change often in growing companies.



AI plays a role in many steps of the recruiting process, especially job posting, candidate screening and interview scheduling.







Other notables
Dozens and dozens of stellar AI products for talent acquisition and longer-term talent management are not complete ATSes yet definitely merit consideration. Here's a sample of those that have risen to the top.


HireVue
HireVue calls its product a ""talent experience platform"" designed to automate workflows and scale hiring. Long noted for its video interview capabilities, HireVue has made them less bias-prone by using natural language translation to provide a transcript for hiring managers and recruiters. The process creates a blind interview and eliminates potential discrimination by race, gender, color, appearance, dialect, name, age, etc.
HireVue's AI recruiting assistant bot is text-only and provides chat-based job matching. It supports mobile devices and smartwatches via text messaging and WhatsApp.
However, what merits attention here is the vendor's documentation, which is prominently placed on its website. HireVue has done something I have nagged vendors about for half a decade: explain how its AI engine works to mitigate adverse impact on protected groups. It has articulated a very clear, detailed and understandable ""Explainability Statement"" providing the transparency that is essential when using AI-based products for hiring and assessment. In addition, a second statement, ""Bias, AI ethics and the HireVue approach,"" documents HireVue's approach to ethical AI in online hiring.
Every purveyor of AI in talent acquisition should make sure buyers have such an understanding.


Paradox
My favorite part of Paradox, I confess, is Olivia, a multilingual recruiting assistant chatbot named after the founder's spouse. I am putting Olivia in the best bot category. According to the company, Olivia can answer tens of thousands of candidate or employee questions accurately, consistently and at any time of the day. As with all the talent acquisition bots included here, Olivia was developed as an assistant to offload repetitive chores and question answering from busy recruiters. This she does, but Olivia also solves the logistical challenge of interview scheduling and can review hundreds of hiring managers' calendars to schedule interviews in seconds. The bot's automated text reminders help to reduce interview cancellations and no-shows, potentially saving time for recruiters. Olivia can also schedule large events, onboarding sessions, seasonal hiring and orientation, and manage registration and reminders.
While Olivia offloads work for recruiters, the Experience Assistant focuses on the potential applicant. Apparently now part of a bot team with Experience Assistant, Olivia becomes a dynamic content-discovery engine that makes any career site experience feel like it was built specifically for that candidate, allowing personalized interaction on mobile and desktop devices. When people start a conversation with Olivia, the chatbot uses candidate responses, geolocation, resume data and more to create an immersive, hyper-personalized experience that serves only the most relevant jobs and content to each person. The experience works with any career site provider and provides the UI that candidates have come to expect on consumer apps like Instagram and Snapchat.
In a slightly different vein, after acquiring Traitify, a personality data company that was building the personality data genome for the employment marketplace, Paradox debuted Animated Assessment. Starring a character named Ash, the two-minute mobile phone app measures a person's openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism through ""me"" and ""not me"" responses. Recruiters can then use the results in ascertaining the fit with their current openings.


An AI caveat for buyers
If you are in the market for a new talent acquisition system or are augmenting an existing system, you will very likely be looking at a product that has AI. AI capabilities can greatly assist recruiters and hiring managers because of the speed and accuracy with which open reqs can be addressed. But as mentioned, buying a product with the machine learning you need means it is not necessarily plug-and-play. Most buyers need training and assistance with the ongoing learning that the AI will have to do to ensure that the requirements of the specific organization are addressed, DEI goals are met and the system doesn't go rogue or lose relevancy over time.
This means carefully evaluating the vendor in addition to the product by asking the following questions:

How large is the support team that works with each customer on their organizationally specific machine learning?
How often is the system refreshed with new learning?
What is the AI development team's roadmap for the year ahead?
Will AI-savvy support teams be spread too thin to accommodate a growing customer base?
What customer education is provided about how the system works?
How does the vendor support the AI transparency essential to explainability?
What is the model for anomaly detection?
How often do the vendor's data scientists monitor the system for signs it has drifted away from intended outcomes?

There is yet another point vital to technology considerations. A study by Madeline Laurano, founder of Aptitude Research, found that one in two recruiters would join another organization if it had better technology. (The study also reported that one in three recruiters were looking for new jobs.) Dated talent acquisition software can well lead to attrition in an organization's recruiting professionals.


An AI caveat for recruiters
Recruiters obviously aren't the only ones with access to AI. Applicants also have easy, cost-free access and can use generative AI and other tools to their benefit -- and in some cases, to the detriment of recruiters. Resumes can be more easily tailored to the job at hand (which can be good) but an applicant can also figure out how to apply for hundreds, even thousands, of jobs at once, which makes gauging actual interest difficult.


Conclusion
The quest for superior talent is never-ending. Through smart technology choices that include AI, machine learning and NLP, recruiters will be able to accomplish this faster and more easily. As important, through wise purchasing decisions, they can also ensure their ability to ethically hire a diverse employee base.
Today's tools cover every aspect of talent acquisition, from recruitment marketing to sourcing, job description management, candidate assessment and pre-screening; recommending other positions in an organization to qualified applicants; offer and rejection management; skill assessment; and career and learning assistance and direction -- all with far more sophisticated analytics than were available in the past.
AI in talent acquisition can provide a hands-free approach to time-intensive tasks such as interview scheduling and initial qualification screening, much like robots in factory-floor automation. Currently, however, the technology is applied more as helping hands, adding speed and efficiency to the same work recruiters have always done. While this may help organizations get by with fewer recruiters, it also can support scenarios where more human contact, not less, is needed.
Editor's note: The products included here rank high in web search results, are comprehensive, have strong integration or are from established vendors of HCM suites.

In Brief


Large Language Models (LLM) like ChatGPT, Bing Chat, Bard, and others can improve the efficiency of common language generation tasks performed by CPAs, but using LLMs entails certain risks. To help CPAs reap the benefits while minimizing the risks of this emerging technology, the authors suggest six principles to guide CPAs as they incorporate LLMs into their work.
Recently, the topic of artificial intelligence (AI) has captured the imagination of the public and professionals alike. Image generators like Dall-E 2 and Stable Diffusion have challenged the definition of art. The increased use of self-driving cars has challenged the role of human drivers. Large Language Models (LLM), including ChatGPT (by OpenAI), Bing Chat (Microsoft), and Bard (Google), have emulated human conversation and facilitated professional and creative writing. LLMs have been quickly adopted by the public. For example, ChatGPT surpassed 100 million users within two months of its release in November 2022, smashing the adoption record previously held by Google, which took one full year to draw the same number of users (“ChatGPT Statistics for 2023: Comprehensive Facts and Data,” DemandSage, 2023, https://www.demandsage.com/chatgpt-statistics/). Nearly 30% of professionals acknowledge having used ChatGPT at work, according to a survey by Fishbowl, a Glassdoor product (“Almost 30% of Professionals Say They’ve Tried ChatGPT at Work,” Bloomberg News, 2023, https://tinyurl.com/3jfempyh). In March 2023, ChatGPT and Bard were the most well-known and used LLMs for public use, with many considering ChatGPT to be more useful (“How ChatGPT and Bard Performed as My Executive Assistants,” New York Times, Brian Chen, March 29, 2023; https://tinyurl.com/4dt98mrm). As of August 2023, the most prominent LLMs are ChatGPT (by OpenAI), Bard (Google), Bing Chat (Microsoft—built using ChatGPT), LLAMA (Meta), Bloom (Big-Science), and Dolly (Databricks) (“Popular Open-Source Large—Language Models,” Analytics Insight, 2023, https://tinyurl.com/5fb3h9e3).
An LLM is best thought of as an extremely fluent extension of predictive text. Just as a smartphone or e-mail client can suggest one or two words based on the context of the sentence being written, an LLM utilizes its training on a vast body of text (its “corpus”) to generate text in response to a user’s prompt. Instead of merely predicting the next two or three upcoming words to complete a phrase or sentence, LLMs can reply to a user’s prompt with several paragraphs of coherent (and often accurate) text across many domains. As of August 2023, LLMs can accept input files and create text (including computer code) from those inputs. One of the primary features of LLMs that distinguish them from other AI models is that LLMs can generate a response to a prompt on an unknown (to them) topic. The response may be highly inaccurate, but the response is based on LLMs’ contextual knowledge of (what they deem are) similar topics.








LLMs in Accounting
LLMs are adept at interpreting, synthesizing, and expressing results in natural language. These capabilities have been applied in a variety of fields, including writing product recommendations for retailers, reading transcripts and summarizing earnings calls, and preparing marketing copy. CPAs—especially at firms with limited resources—may be curious to experiment with LLMs to improve the efficiency of common language generation tasks. For example, LLMs can be used to form a rough draft summarizing tax issues to a taxpayer client, prepare a memo to staff, draft a courteous e-mail to an audit client, describe how to conduct a particular process, conduct research into technical topics, or quickly gain an understanding of the risks and opportunities facing a particular industry.

Using LLMs effectively requires an appreciation of the risks of this technology. One of the major risks is data privacy. CPAs have a responsibility to protect client data, and need to practice extreme caution when using LLMs with client data. LLMs have many features (for example, as of August 2023, ChatGPT has the ability to accept multiple input files of data; “ChatGPT—Release Notes,” OpenAI, 2023, https://tinyurl.com/25a27fhd) that make it easy and enticing to input client data into the LLM, but uploading data entails significant data security risks. Other risks associated with LLMs include their limited ability to provide useful responses in specialized bodies of knowledge, their struggle to adequately process facts that adhere to a timeline, the difficulty in sorting fact from fiction in their responses, the need to critically assess the rationale for their answers, their struggle to cite their sources, and determining which degree of confidence should be placed in their answers.
The accounting profession is currently navigating the tension between the advantages offered by LLMs and their risks. For example, in February 2023, PwC Australia encouraged their staff to “experiment with ChatGPT personally, and to think about the role generative AI could play in our business” (“PwC Warns Staff against Using ChatGPT for Client Work,” Australian Financial Review, 2023, https://tinyurl.com/43de5crw), but cautioned:

It is important that we navigate the risks and limitations of using [LLMs]… They are stochastic in nature (meaning you could get a different answer every time you ask the same question), they can present inaccuracies as though they are facts, and they are prone to user error. They will require review and oversight and cross-validation of results before they can be relied upon for tasks that demand precision.

Six Principles for the Effective Use Of LLMs



Research on the performance of LLMs in the accounting domain is rapidly emerging. In January 2023, a team of 327 researchers compared the performance of ChatGPT 3.5 to university students. They found that, although students outperformed ChatGPT 3.5 by an average score of 76.7% versus 56.5%, ChatGPT 3.5 performed better than students on a not-inconsiderable 15.8% of assessments (David A. Wood, et al., “The ChatGPT Artificial Intelligence Chatbot: How Well Does It Answer Accounting Assessment Questions?”, Issues in Accounting Education, November 2023). However, four months later, Eulerich, Sanatizadeh, Vakilzadeh, and Wood found that the next generation of ChatGPT (ChatGPT 4.0) was able to “easily pass” the CPA, CMA, CIA, and EA (enrolled agent) exams with an average score of 85.1% (“Can Artificial Intelligence Pass Accounting Certification Exams? ChatGPT: CPA, CMA, CIA, and EA?”). A related line of literature applies LLMs to hypothetical or actual accounting practice. Street and Wilck applied ChatGPT 3.5 to the forensic accounting domain and concluded that forensic accountants need to apply their own accounting expertise to critically evaluate LLM responses for shortcomings (Daniel Street and Joseph Wilck, “‘Let’s Have a Chat’: Principles for the Effective Application of ChatGPT and Large Language Models in the Practice of Forensic Accounting,” Journal of Forensic and Investigative Accounting, July–December 2023, http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4351817). Emett et al. documented the application of ChatGPT 3.5 in a large energy company’s internal audit function and estimate efficiency gains of 50-80% (Scott A. Emett, Marc Eulerich, Egemen Lipinski, Nicolo Prien, and David A. Wood, “Leveraging ChatGPT for Enhancing the Internal Audit Process–A Real-World Example from a Large Multinational Company,” 2023, working paper, http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4514238). Notably, each of these articles identified risks and challenges facing accountants seeking to benefit from LLMs.
Grounded in this recent research, this article provides six principles to guide CPAs as they incorporate LLMs into their workflow. Applying these principles will enable CPAs to minimize the risk of this emerging technology while still reaping the available benefits of increased efficiency and effectiveness. After describing each of the six principles, this article provides an illustration that demonstrates how applying these principles improves the performance of LLMs on a tax accounting task.


The Six Principles

1. Develop Specific Questions and Avoid Broad Requests
LLMs are trained on a broad corpus of text and have a wide range of domain knowledge. This can make them very effective tools, but asking the right questions in the accounting domain takes practice. Prompts (questions) for LLMs are most effective if they are specific and reference the context of the prompt. For example, the prompt “How should a building be valued on the balance sheet under U.S. GAAP?” will be more effective than “How should a building be valued on a balance sheet?”. CPAs should also either avoid or define ambiguous terms within the prompt. “How do I account for the purchase of a bond as an investment?” is more likely to be effective than “How do I record a bond transaction?”, because “bond” could either refer to the transaction in which a bond is issued or purchased. Users can also provide an example in the prompt and request that the LLM use a specific framework (e.g., “Prepare an expected credit loss schedule for my receivables using the following table format”).
In summary, we recommend that CPAs provide LLMs with prompts that are specific, provide the context for the question, explain or define ambiguous terms, and provide an example (if applicable).


2. Actively Monitor the Inquiry and Interpretation Process by Breaking Down Complex Tasks into Verifiable Subtasks
The breadth of information in an LLM’s corpus can lead to problems when different accounting bases or tax standards can apply to a given prompt. For instance, unless instructed clearly, an LLM could provide information from either U.S. GAAP or IFRS; thus, it is critical that CPAs must exercise skepticism and utilize their expertise to ensure that the proper concepts have been applied in the output of the LLM. Only with sufficient expertise will an accountant recognize when IFRS standards are being applied, but U.S. GAAP standards are needed. (Different LLMs have different strengths and weaknesses: It’s worth noting that, as of August 2023, ChatGPT does not reliably cite its sources; in fact, sometimes when you ask ChatGPT to cite sources, it makes up sources that don’t exist. On the other hand, Bing Chat reliably cites its sources by providing web links.) In other words, LLMs are subject to significant rates of “Type 2 error”: LLMs may provide responses that appear relevant and accurate on their face, but are inaccurate when reviewed more carefully. Therefore, we recommend that CPAs maintain a high degree of concept skepticism, critically assessing whether the concept that the LLM has applied in a given response is indeed the correct concept expected to be applied (with respect to accounting basis, framework, or standard).
LLMs are trained on a corpus of data that spans time. Although this provides them with an impressive breadth of knowledge, LLMs struggle to differentiate between information over time. An LLM might provide the current accounting and tax standard information, or it might provide outdated and superseded information. CPAs should also understand and carefully consider the extent to which the LLM they employ has access to current information. The corpus supporting ChatGPT 3.5, for example, only consists of information through the end of 2021; ChatGPT 3.5, therefore, will not be able to provide tax or accounting information that has changed since that time. Its response to a request for the IRS mileage rates or the deductibility of medical expenses may or may not contain correct information for the proper tax year. Similarly, it will not be able to describe the impact of any current economic or business events occurring after that date. Other LLMs including Bing Chat and Bard have access to Internet information sources, and can more reliably refer to current information. We recommend that CPAs critically assess whether the information that the LLM has provided indeed applies to the proper time period.
In the authors’ experience, LLMs provide more accurate responses to specific tasks and questions rather than large or complex tasks. For example, ChatGPT 3.5 provides more accurate responses when prompted to generate the assets, liabilities, or stockholders’ equity portions of a balance sheet separately rather than preparing an entire balance sheet at once. We recommend that CPAs break down large tasks into smaller portions and ask LLMs to perform those smaller tasks in sequence. This also allows for a user to verify the correctness of each smaller task before beginning the next step in the process.


3. Understand LLMs’ Contextual Boundaries, and Do Not Input Private, Sensitive, or Proprietary Information
In addition to the data provided in its corpus, an LLM can receive and respond to user-submitted text and data. Although this feature facilitates the broad functionality of LLMs, inputting private, sensitive, or proprietary data input into an LLM, raises serious concerns about data storage and privacy issues. For example, LLMs could incorporate user-submitted data into their knowledge and then synthesize and provide this information to other users without the right to this data. Until and unless LLMs are implemented with reliable privacy safeguards (including an “on-premise server” or a “private instance” for a particular company or firm), the authors recommend that CPAs do not input private, sensitive, or proprietary information into LLMs.
LLMs are designed to have natural conversations with users. ChatGPT, Bing Chat, and Bard all attempt to remember the context of a conversation and, once effectively prompted, stay within the scope of the topic. If the LLM misinterprets a prompt or additional information is needed, users can ask follow-up or clarifying questions and the LLM will consider them within the context of the earlier questions within the conversation. For example, if you ask an LLM about how a building should be valued under U.S. GAAP and then in a subsequent question ask, “Which depreciation methods are acceptable?”, it is likely to tailor its responses to depreciation methods common for buildings. Therefore, we recommend that users ask follow-up questions and provide clarifications and directions within a given conversation. But exercise discretion with feedback—LLMs can learn from user feedback and incorporate it into its base of knowledge.
As of August 2023, ChatGPT, Bing Chat, and Google Bard all have the ability to save previous chats (known as “chat history”). However, ChatGPT does not actively remember the context of previous chats when answering responses in a new chat (OpenAI Developer Forum, April 2023, https://community.openai.com/). Similar documentation for Bing Chat is unavailable, but it is reasonable to expect that Bing Chat also does not remember the context of previous chats when responding to a new chat; by contrast, Google Bard was designed to remember previous conversations. Bard’s capability is limited by the amount of computing memory and available capacity; thus, its recollection may not be very good (Bard FAQ Page, August 2023, https://bard.google.com/faq). Because many LLMs cannot access context developed in other conversations, the authors recommend that CPAs create a new conversation when switching to a new task or topic.


4. Carefully Scrutinize and Recalculate Quantitative Responses
Although impressively fluent with text, LLMs are quite poor at any but the clearest quantitative tasks. It is important for CPAs to remember that the fundamental task of an LLM is to suggest a sequence of text that best responds to the user’s prompt. LLMs are not designed to produce quantitative responses, nor are they skilled at mathematical procedures, although they will provide numeric text if that text is predicted to be the best in a given response. For example, when the authors tasked ChatGPT with creating an income statement based on several business transactions, a portion of its response asserted that $2.00 + $5.50 + $7.50 = $17.50. Similarly, when preparing a partial balance sheet, it asserted that fixed assets “have a total value of $1,775.00 but also have been depreciated by $1,055.00. The net value of the fixed assets after depreciation is $4,720.00.” CPAs are much better off utilizing spreadsheet software, business calculators, or nearly any other alternative software rather than relying on an LLM to conduct mathematical procedures. CPAs can ask LLMs to suggest, identify, or describe the mathematical process to be used for a given scenario, but we recommend that CPAs do not use LLMs to actually perform mathematical calculations.


5. Rely on Other Sources for Factual Information, Especially for Less Prominent Topics
Like many other LLMs, ChatGPT was trained on a large corpus that included both fact and fiction across many knowledge areas. Approximately 3% of ChatGPT’s corpus consists of “facts” from Wikipedia and an additional 38% has been vetted by humans beyond the original author. [ChatGPT’s corpus consisted of a general “crawl” of the Internet (60%), websites with a certain level of upvotes (22%), books (16%), and Wikipedia (3%) (“Language Models are Few-Shot Learners,” Tom B. Brown, Benjamin Mann, Nick Ryder, et al., 2020, https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165). Although the general “crawl” provided the largest amount of data included in the corpus, Wikipedia data was given the highest weight, followed by websites with the most up-votes. ChatGPT’s crawl of the Internet allowed it to learn how to use conversational language across a wide breadth of content.] In addition to factual knowledge, ChatGPT has been designed to engage in human-like conversation and is capable of creating new answers; it can create new computer code, write a poem, or speak in a given person’s style. Its training encouraged it to communicate facts as well as to communicate with human-like creativity. Unfortunately, ChatGPT does not articulate to the user whether it is conveying facts or displaying creativity; hence, it may lie. Other LLMs have different training and reward structures, and are capable of providing references for facts.
The “knowledge” of an LLM is probabilistic. The authors have encountered situations where ChatGPT’s responses have disagreed with each other, even in the same conversation. For example, the authors have observed ChatGPT state that an event has occurred in one year, but when asked again, it states that the event actually occurred in a different year. Certain firms have prohibited the use of ChatGPT due to concerns over factual accuracy (“PwC Warns Staff against Using ChatGPT for Client Work,” Australian Financial Review, 2023, https://tinyurl.com/43de5crw). We recommend that CPAs seek “knowledge” or “facts” from sources other than an LLM. CPAs should evaluate and cross-check any factual claims provided by an LLM using a reliable alternative source.
The more frequently an item appears in an LLM’s corpus, the more knowledgeable the LLM will be about that topic. More prominent concepts, events, and firms appear more frequently in the corpus, and allow the LLM to respond more capably to prompts on these subjects. For example, an LLM is much more capable of addressing questions about federal tax law than about municipal tax regulations. Therefore, we suggest that CPAs rely more on the responses provided by LLMs for topics that are more prominent.


6. Use LLMs to Enhance Rather than Replace Human Expertise
LLMs can make the work of a CPA more efficient and potentially more effective, but they cannot replace a CPA’s expertise. The authors have successfully used LLMs to enhance our work by having them:

 Draft memos or e-mails
 Structure sensitive and effective feedback
 Overcome writer’s block and jumpstart creativity
 Gather information on technical accounting topics
 Generate understandable descriptions of technical issues in auditing
 Provide introductory information about opportunities and threats facing particular industries
 Review notable historical and economic events
 Produce creative text.

Although the authors recommend that accountants use LLMs to enhance their work on a variety of tasks, we do not predict the “death of accounting” at the hands of LLMs anytime soon, for at least four reasons:

 LLMs cannot be relied upon as a trustworthy subordinate or specialist because they fail to comply with the expertise, objectivity, and independence requirements of auditors (AICPA Code of Professional Conduct section .300.050.01-02 and AU-C section 620, “Using the Work of an Auditor’s Specialist”), nor can LLM output serve as audit evidence because its work is not reproducible, nor guaranteed to be sufficient and appropriate (AU-C section 500, “Audit Evidence”). If LLMs cannot truly be objective and independent, nor can they produce reliable audit evidence, they cannot be relied on as a trustworthy subordinate or specialist.
 Even if LLMs are improved technically to understand the nuanced context of accounting events and to properly perform the required mathematical operations, LLMs will not be able to exercise the professional judgment of a CPA when it comes to the qualities of decision-useful information.
 Although broadly trained, LLMs are unlikely to be able to tailor their responses to the particular institutional features and dynamics of a specific topic, especially if it is small or unique.
 At best, LLMs are trained on recent data, but they will always be based on historical training and will struggle to provide innovative, future-oriented advice.




An Illustration Applying the Six Principles
To illustrate how CPAs can apply these six principles in practice, consider the following hypothetical situation: The year is 2021. You sent an update to your client list about eligibility for the California Young Child Tax Credit. One of your clients falls within the phase-out range for this credit (Regina Jenkins, a W2 employee with AGI of $28,000 and single mother of two qualifying children, a 3-year-old daughter and a 7-year-old son). Regina has heard a lot about the Federal Advance Child Tax Credit Payments in 2021, so she sent you an e-mail asking whether she’ll be receiving monthly checks for this California credit, and if so, whether and how she should opt-out.
Prompt 1:

I sent all of my clients an email about an upcoming tax credit [1] that they may qualify for. [2] Regina Jenkins [3], my client, has an adjusted gross income of $28,000. Regina told me that she is eligible for the tax credit. Does that mean she’ll receive a check immediately? [4] How much would the check be? [5] Should she opt out of the payment? [6,7]

Principles Violated by Prompt 1:

This prompt was not specific enough, violating Principle 1 in several ways. First, the prompt used the ambiguous term “tax credit” rather than specifying the credit. Second, information was sought about the California Young Child Tax Credit rather than the Federal Advance Child Tax Credit, but this was not made clear.
Seeking information on a California credit violates Principle 5 by asking for information related to a niche rather than a prominent topic.
Providing our client’s name violates Principle 3 by giving the LLM private and sensitive client information.
This question violates Principle 5 because it asks ChatGPT for reliable, factual information.
Asking ChatGPT to provide an inherently quantitative response violates Principle 4.
This question cedes responsibility to ChatGPT rather than being used to leverage the CPA’s own expertise, violating Principle 6.
Asking all three of these questions at once violates Principle 2 and does not leverage LLMs contextual boundaries (discussed in Principle 3).

Performance of selected LLMs on Prompt 1. The authors input “Prompt 1” into ChatGPT, Bing Chat, and Google Bard in August 2023.
ChatGPT. ChatGPT responded about tax credits broadly, rather than seeking clarification about which tax credit information was sought. Although each of the questions in the prompt was addressed in the response, the answers were not sufficiently precise. A portion of the response provided by ChatGPT follows: “The eligibility for a tax credit doesn’t necessarily mean that the individual will receive a check immediately. Tax credits can affect a person’s tax liability, which could result in a refund or reduced tax owed when they file their tax return for the relevant tax year.” (ChatGPT 3.5, OpenAI, https://chat.openai.com/). At the end of its response, ChatGPT acknowledged its limitations and caveated its response with a recommendation that Regina should “reach out to a tax professional who can guide her based on her individual circumstances and the specific tax credit in question.”
Bing Chat: Rather than providing information about a given tax credit or about tax credits broadly, Bing Chat requested more specific information from the user. A portion of its response follows: “It is not clear which tax credit you are referring to. There are many tax credits available, and the amount and eligibility requirements vary depending on the specific credit. Could you please provide more information about the tax credit you mentioned in your e-mail to your clients? That way, I can better assist you with your question.” (Bing Chat, Microsoft, https://www.bing.com/search/)
Google Bard: Google Bard assumed we sought information about the Federal Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Based on this assumption, it attempted to calculate Regina’s EITC, then stated that Regina would not receive an advance payment. A portion of its response follows: “The tax credit you are referring to is the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Regina is eligible for the EITC because her adjusted gross income (AGI) is below the threshold for her filing status. The maximum EITC for a taxpayer with an AGI of $28,000 is $480. Regina will not receive a check immediately. The EITC is a refundable tax credit, which means that it can reduce Regina’s tax liability to zero and she will receive any remaining credit as a refund. Regina should not opt out of the payment. The EITC is a valuable tax credit that can help Regina reduce her tax burden and get a larger refund.” (Bard, Google, https://bard.google.com/).
By contrast, Prompt 2 adheres to the above principles by relying on the CPA’s judgment and expertise at quantitative tasks while leveraging LLMs’ fluid writing abilities. In the following prompt, the underlined portions in the following prompt demonstrate how the prompt adheres to the six principles, which are specified in brackets. (Neither the underline formatting nor the bracketed contents were provided to the LLMs.)
Prompt 2:

I have a client [Principle 3] who is eligible for the 2021 California Young Child Tax Credit [Principle 1]. They are subject to a phaseout [Principles 5, 6] because their income is between $25k and $30k. Because of the phase-out, they are eligible for a total annual refundable credit of $434 [Principle 4] on their year-end tax return rather than the maximum possible credit of $1,083. Please draft an e-mail to send to my client to explain this situation. [Principles 1, 7]

Performance of selected LLMs on Prompt 2: The authors input “Prompt 2” into ChatGPT, Bing Chat, and Google Bard in August 2023. ChatGPT, Bing Chat, and Google Bard each generated an e-mail template in a matter of seconds. The responses from each of the tools were noticeably more accurate than those provided in response to Prompt 1.
ChatGPT: ChatGPT provided a well-written, professional e-mail that cogently communicated the impact of the phase-out on Regina’s credit amount. A portion of that response follows: “Given your income level, I want to clarify the specifics of how the phaseout affects your eligibility and the resulting credit amount. The maximum possible credit for the California Young Child Tax Credit is $1,083. However, due to your income being within the aforementioned phase-out range, your eligibility is adjusted accordingly. Based on your income and the phaseout rules, you are eligible for a total annual refundable credit of $434. This means that when you file your year-end tax return, you can claim this credit, which will contribute to reducing your tax liability or increasing your refund. While this amount is less than the maximum credit, it still provides a valuable benefit to your financial situation.” (ChatGPT 3.5, OpenAI, https://chat.openai.com/).
Bing Chat: Bing produced a similarly cogent, considerate, and professional e-mail. A portion of that response follows: “Based on the information you provided, it appears that you are subject to a phaseout because your income is between $25,000 and $30,000. As a result, you are eligible for a total annual refundable credit of $434 on your year-end tax return, rather than the maximum possible credit of $1,083. I understand that this may be disappointing news, but please know that this credit is still a valuable benefit that can help reduce your tax liability. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me.” (Bing Chat, Microsoft, https://www.bing.com/search/).
Google Bard: Bard’s response was very similar to that provided by the other two LLMs, but it provided incorrect information about the age requirement for a qualifying child in California. A portion of its response follows: “I’m writing to you today to discuss the California Young Child Tax Credit (YCTC) that you may be eligible for. The YCTC provides a refundable credit of up to $1,083 per eligible tax return for families with a qualifying child under the age of 6. [sic] I understand that your income is between $25,000 and $30,000, which means that you are subject to the YCTC phaseout. This means that your credit will be reduced as your income increases. In your case, your credit will be reduced to a total annual refundable credit of $434. I know that this may be disappointing, but I want to assure you that you are still eligible for a significant credit. The YCTC can help to offset the cost of raising a young child, and it can also help to make your tax return more affordable.” (Bard, Google, https://bard.google.com/).
The inaccuracy in Bard’s response (the age limit for a “qualifying child” according to the California YCTC in 2021 was 19 if not a full-time student and 24 if a full-time student) emphasizes the need for Principles 2 and 6. It is critical that CPAs verify the accuracy of each subtask completed by an LLM and apply their own domain expertise. This weakness aside, each of the LLMs produced an effective first draft of the client email in a matter of seconds, illustrating significant efficiency.


Take a Careful Approach
Since beginning our research on ChatGPT, the authors have been asked to provide a summary of the usefulness and impact of LLMs in the domain of accounting. Some academics and professionals that we spoke with wonder if LLMs like ChatGPT are a panacea—after all, there have been widespread reports about its remarkable capabilities—while others dismiss LLMs as unreliable, unhelpful, and overblown. The authors believe that neither extreme perspective is accurate; rather, we believe that CPAs who appropriately incorporate LLMs into their work can improve both their efficiency and effectiveness. Appropriately incorporating LLMs into accounting requires a careful, strategic approach. Therefore, CPAs are encouraged to utilize the principles provided in this article to appropriately leverage LLMs in their work.

Fresh research from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab questions the economic practicality of using AI for automating tasks in the workplace at this stage.

         — 
    


            As anxiety about artificial intelligence tools putting workers out of jobs reaches a global fever pitch, new research suggests that the economy isn’t ready for machines to put most humans out of work.
    

            The fresh research finds that the impact of AI on the labor market will likely have a much slower adoption than some had previously feared as the AI revolution continues to dominate headlines. This carries hopeful implications for policymakers currently looking at ways to offset the worst of the labor market impacts linked to the recent rise of AI.
    

            In a study published Monday, researchers at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab sought to quantify the question of not just will AI automate human jobs, but when this could happen. Researchers ended up finding that a vast majority of jobs previously identified as vulnerable to AI are not economically beneficial for employers to automate at this time.

            One key finding, for example, is that only about 23% of the wages paid to humans right now for jobs that could potentially be done by AI tools would be cost-effective for employers to replace with machines right now.
    

            While this could change over time, the overall findings suggest that job disruption from AI will likely unfurl at a gradual pace.
    

            “In many cases, humans are the more cost-effective way, and a more economically attractive way, to do work right now,” Neil Thompson, one of the study’s authors and the director of the future tech research project at MIT’s Computer Science and AI Lab, told CNN in an interview.

            “What we’re seeing is that while there is a lot of potential for AI to replace tasks, it’s not going to happen immediately,” Thompson added, saying that amid all the headlines about robots taking jobs, “It’s really important to think about the economics of actually implementing these systems.”
    

            In the study, Thompson and his team analyzed the majority of jobs that have been previously identified as “exposed” to AI, or at risk of being lost to AI, especially in the realm of computer vision. The researchers then looked at the wages paid to workers currently doing these jobs, and calculated how much it might cost to bring on an automated tool instead.
    

            A retail worker, for example, might currently be responsible for visually checking inventory or ensuring that the prices listed throughout a store on specific merchandise is accurate. A machine trained in computer vision could technically do this job, Thompson notes, but at this stage it would still make the most economic sense for an employer to pay a human worker to do it.
    

            “There’s a reason that AI has not been everywhere immediately,” Thompson said. “There’s an economics behind that.”

            “And I think this actually should be very reminiscent of things that we’ve seen with other technologies,” he added.
    

            Like previous high-profile technological disruptions to the labor market, such as the rise of manufacturing economies replacing agricultural economies, the AI disruption to jobs will likely be more gradual than it is abrupt. This could mean that policymakers, employers and even workers can start best preparing and adapting for these coming changes now.
    

            Just last week, the International Monetary Fund warned that almost 40% of jobs globally could be affected by the rise of AI and that this trend will likely deepen existing inequality.
    

            In a blog post last week warning of their latest projections, IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva called for governments to work on establishing social safety nets or retraining programs to counter the impacts of AI’s disruption.
    

            The new research from Thompson and his team at MIT can give these policymakers a better understanding of the timeline they should be thinking about as they look for solutions to ameliorate the worst of AI’s impacts to the labor market.
    

            “[The study] gives us this ability to start being a little more quantitative of how rapidly we expect worker displacement to happen,” Thompson said. “And that will allow people to start building plans that are much more concrete in terms of the retraining that needs to be done.”

Similar to these global counterparts, the Indian government recognizes AI&rsquo;s potential to have a sweeping impact on society, including negative impacts such as bias and privacy violations. In the last several years, India has introduced initiatives and guidelines for the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies, but there are currently no specific laws regulating AI in India. </p>
<p><strong>Defining Principles and Frameworks</strong></p>
<p>The Indian government tasked the NITI Aayog, its apex public policy think tank, with establishing guidelines and policies for the development and use of AI. In 2018, the NITI Aayog released the <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://indiaai.gov.in/research-reports/national-strategy-for-artificial-intelligence/"" target=""_blank"">National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence #AIForAll</a> strategy, which featured AI research and development guidelines focused on healthcare, agriculture, education, &ldquo;smart&rdquo; cities and infrastructure, and smart mobility and transformation. </p>
<p>In February 2021, the NITI Aayog released <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://indiaai.gov.in/research-reports/responsible-ai-part-1-principles-for-responsible-ai"" target=""_blank"">Part 1 - Principles for Responsible AI</a>, an approach paper that explores the various ethical considerations of deploying AI solutions in India, divided into system considerations and societal considerations. While the system considerations mostly deal with the overall principles behind decision-making, rightful inclusion of beneficiaries, and accountability of AI decisions, societal considerations focus on the impact of automation on job creation and employment. In August 2021, the NITI Aayog released <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://indiaai.gov.in/research-reports/responsible-ai-part-2-operationalizing-principles-for-responsible-ai"" target=""_blank"">Part 2 - Operationalizing Principles for Responsible AI</a>, which focuses on operationalizing principles for responsible AI. The report breaks down the actions that need to be taken by both the government and the private sector, in partnership with research institutes, to cover regulatory and policy interventions, capacity building, incentivizing ethics by design, and creating frameworks for compliance with relevant AI standards. </p>
<p>The government of India also recently enacted a new privacy law, the <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2023/08/india-enacts-new-privacy-law-the-digital-personal-data-protection-act"" target=""_blank"">Digital Personal Data Protection Act</a> in 2023, which it can leverage to address some of the privacy concerns concerning AI platforms. </p>
<p><strong>Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence and International Collaboration</strong></p>
<p>Additionally, India is a member of the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI). The 2023 GPAI Summit was recently held in New Delhi, where GPAI experts presented their work on responsible AI, data governance, and the future of work, innovation, and commercialization. The <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""http://www.gpai.ai"" target=""_blank"">GPAI website</a> provides that &ldquo;as a vital branch of the initiative, GPAI&rsquo;s Experts produce deliverables that can be integrated into Members&rsquo; national strategies to ensure the inclusive and sustainable development of AI. Under the 2023 themes of climate change, global health and societal resilience, Experts worked to ensure that AI is used responsibly to address current challenges around the world. GPAI&rsquo;s Members, on the other hand, adopted the 2023 Ministerial Declaration, reaffirming their commitment to the trustworthy stewardship of AI in line with the OECD AI Principles, as well as their dedication to implementing those principles through the development of regulations, policies, standards and other initiatives. In doing so, they highlighted efforts to bridge the gap between theory and practice, and advance AI that is responsible, sustainable, and inclusive for all.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Other Indian agencies are also working on AI policies for the country, including the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, which has created committees on AI that have submitted <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://www.meity.gov.in/artificial-intelligence-committees-reports"" target=""_blank"">reports on the development, safety, and ethical issues related to AI</a>. The Bureau of Indian Standards, which is the national standards body of India, has also established a committee on AI that is proposing <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://www.services.bis.gov.in/php/BIS_2.0/dgdashboard/Published_Standards_new/standards?commttid=Mzg2&amp;commttname=TElURCAzMA%3D%3D&amp;aspect=&amp;doe=&amp;from=2022-07-21&amp;to=2023-07-21"" target=""_blank"">draft Indian standards for AI</a>. </p>
<p>While the government of India has taken steps to regulate AI, its approach has mainly been one of pro-innovation with the development of policies and guidelines that acknowledge the ethical concerns and risks around the use of AI that may require the adoption of best practices. Given India&rsquo;s advantage of having a robust software development industry, this approach makes sense until the government formally enacts AI regulations. </p>
<p><strong>International Opportunities</strong></p>
<p>The AI landscape in India is continuously evolving. Uncertainty, however, has not stopped both local and international interest and growth in this space. General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. announced a partnership with an India-based AI company, 114ai, to develop advanced technology for complex military systems. In September 2023, the US-based chip firm NVIDIA Corporation announced partnerships with Indian conglomerates Reliance Industries Ltd. and Tata group to develop cloud infrastructure and language models, wherein NVIDIA will provide the computing power required for building a cloud AI infrastructure platform.</p>
<p>An entity looking to enter the AI space in India should carefully consider the <a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2024/01/india-emerging-as-a-manufacturing-powerhouse#:~:text=India%20is%20the%20world's%20fifth,companies%20on%20a%20global%20scale.#:~:text=India%20is%20the%20world's%20fifth,companies%20on%20a%20global%20scale."" target=""_blank"">best legal route</a> for such entry, whether through a joint venture, a strategic alliance, or a wholly owned subsidiary. Each route can be leveraged, and structures can be put in place depending on the level of investment and control required by the investing foreign entity. This is particularly important in a dynamic space like AI, where regulation is continuously evolving. Issues such as liability for harm caused, rights to intellectual property for AI systems, and privacy and data protection have not been fully fleshed out in regulations. Therefore, entities looking to enter this space should carefully consider the best legal and contractual protections. </p>

How will artificial intelligence impact the workplace? 











How will artificial intelligence impact the workplace?
16:42

Technology companies are investing heavily in artificial intelligence, and some workers are already paying the price.SAP is the latest big tech player to cut jobs as it pours money into AI, with the German software giant announcing this week that it is investing more than $2 billion to integrate artificial intelligence into its business as part of what it called ""transformation program."" At the same time, the company said Tuesday it plans to restructure 8,000 roles. Some of the workers will be laid off, while others will be re-trained to work with AI. The company said it expects to employ roughly the same number of workers at year's end as it does now.  






SAP is not an outlier. In the little more than a year since generative AI tools like ChatGPT, based on so-called large language model technology, have been available to the public, a number of large tech companies have announced plans to plunge into AI — job cuts often follow. ""I would counsel folks to watch what the firms do, and if they are saying the presence of large language models is allowing them to lay people off, that has to be taken into account,"" said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies the interplay between technology and people. ""There is no doubt forthcoming work is going to show that coding and many engineering type occupations have very high exposure levels [to AI]. So we should take them at face value on this.""

Last week, Alphabet-owned Google said it laid off hundreds of workers from its ad sales team as it further invests in AI. Although Google did not directly attribute the layoffs to AI, in a memo to employees obtained by Business Insider Google's chief business officer, Philipp Schindler, referred to the ""profound moment we're in with AI"" in announcing the cuts. Microsoft is also doubling down on AI, investing billions in ChatGPT maker OpenAI, as it slashes jobs. And language learning platform Duolingo acknowledged a 10% reduction in its contractor workforce at the end of 2023, but denied that all of the cuts were related to increased AI usage.""In some cases, this was because the contractor's project concluded, and in some cases this was because the contractor's work was no longer needed due to changes in how we generate and share content between our 100+ language courses,"" a spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. Duolingo added that it does sometimes use AI to generate sentences and translations and that AI can help contractors work faster. 


Is AI already replacing people?To be sure, some of the companies are redirecting their investments into AI while cutting spending in other areas of their business, leading to layoffs. Columbia University business professor Oded Netzer cautioned against linking rising corporate investment in AI to worker layoffs. ""We know 2023 was the year of generative AI and companies invested in it heavily,"" he told CBS MoneyWatch. ""That means there are some jobs they've decided to invest less in, and they may be laying off workers. But it also means the jobs they're hiring for are related to AI. That's not to say AI replaces jobs."" In Netzer's view, companies are simply doing what they typically do — hiring more workers that specialize in fast-growing parts of the business, while laying off those whose skills may be less useful or contribute less to revenue growth. For example, he said, as Microsoft invests in AI it might decide to scale back its production of computer hardware, like keyboards. Still, recent tech layoffs may be a troubling sign for employees who were told that AI would eliminate some of the rote work associated with their jobs, freeing them up to engage in more creative or productive work. Because technology is diffused across all types of companies in different sectors, big tech corporations can serve as a bellwether for the rest of the economy. ""All sort of firms use digital technologies, so I think this is a sobering signal. It does appear these impacts are occurring quite rapidly,"" Muro of Brookings said.Eliminating workers as they invest in AI is ""low hanging fruit"" for companies, he added. Yet a lot remains to be seen about how the AI revolution plays out in the workplace. ""A lot of training and re-skilling may be a common outcome. There may be some layoffs with the enhancement of other jobs,"" he said. 






AI could replace 30% of work hours by 2030, new research finds
06:19

Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, told CBS MoneyWatch that AI tools are not yet sophisticated enough to replace workers entirely. They may be able to perform certain job functions, but still require human input and supervision. The layoffs are also likely tied to companies consolidating their workforces after going on hiring sprees during the pandemic, he added.


""They are rebalancing after the huge hiring burst we saw couple years back during the pandemic when people were at home, consuming more tech products than they normally would have,"" Stahle said. ""Now they are back out flying and staying at hotels, and the shift in consumer demand is necessitating an adjustment at these tech companies."" If AI were really the culprit, layoffs would be far more widespread across diverse industries, according to Stahle. ""And we haven't seen that happen yet,"" he said. Also contributing to tech company layoffs are high interest rates. ""Tech companies are always very sensitive to high interest rates and layoff people during high interest rate environment,"" said Columbia University Business school professor Tania Babina.  ""When money is cheap, tech firms pile on hiring; when money is expensive, they tighten the belt. So far, there is no systematic empirical evidence that firms use AI to replace labor,"" she said.

Generative AI, like ChatGPT, could inject as much as $1 trillion into the US economy over the next decade.That's according to a study on the economic impacts of generative AI published on January 10 by tech solutions corporation Cognizant, in collaboration with Oxford Economics.The study also found that over half of all jobs driving the US economy will be significantly impacted by AI, with a small percentage of workers losing their jobs and struggling to find new employment.

The study used a model to simulate three levels of AI business adoption — low, middle, and high — and how those rates could impact jobs and careers.

Companies will quickly adopt AI technology, impacting jobsThe model first examined how quickly businesses will adopt AI.The authors described the 2023 level of AI usage as the ""experimental phase,"" with 13% of companies already using the technology. This came just months after OpenAI released ChatGPT in November 2022.However, that use is expected to grow quickly to 31% in the next four to eight years, depending on the level of aggression used in the model, and nearly 50% in 10 years.Adoption rates are projected to slow after 10 years but will continue to grow for another 20 years as they approach 100% adoption under all three models.

The study's model also looked at 18,000 tasks that the researchers identified as drivers of the US economy, such as content generation, market analysis, image generation, reports, and emails. Then, they looked at the impact of generative AI on the about 1,000 jobs that use these tasks, like management, sales, design, media, and legal positions.The model looked at the percentage of tasks that AI could automate for each job.90% of jobs will have at least 5% of their high-value tasks automated by AI.52% of jobs will have at least 25% of their high-value tasks affected by AI. About 8% of jobs were at this level in 2023.The model showed that AI could lead to 9% of the US workforce losing their job in the next 10 years. What's more, about one out of every nine displaced workers — about 1% of the total US workforce — will struggle to find new work after being pushed out because the skills needed for their current jobs will not translate to an AI-dominated workforce.

Other studies have also projected large disruptions to the workforce, both in the US and worldwide.A Goldman Sachs report in March estimated that over 300 million jobs worldwide could be disrupted by AI. A report from McKinsey estimated at least 12 million Americans would be forced to find a new job by 2030.AI will cause an economic boomThe surge in AI adoption by companies signifies a huge impact on the US economy, the study found.US productivity is projected to grow by at least 1.7% and as much as 3.5% over the next decade due to AI. This growth translates to an increase in the US GDP by $477 billion to $1 trillion annually over the next decade.

""The research findings showcase just how quickly this technology might disrupt the trajectory of the US economy, offering invaluable insights for leaders to harness its potential and adapt swiftly,"" Cooper wrote when announcing the study.AI's disruption will be different than other advancesThe researchers noted that AI will impact the workforce differently than previous technological advancements.Instead of replacing manual labor jobs and ""process-centric knowledge work,"" like data entry, AI is expected to have a bigger effect on knowledge work, such as credit analysis, computer programming, web development, database administration, and graphic design.

According to the study, some of these careers have already seen 50% of their most important tasks replaced by AI, which could grow to 80% in 10 years.This was echoed in a June report by McKinsey that found high earners could experience the biggest impact of generative AI automation.

The ripple effect even extends to CEOs. The Cognizant and Oxford Economics study found that at least 25% of a CEO's tasks could be automated by AI, helping with things like reviewing reports, analyzing operations, conducting competitive assessments, and making strategic decisions.The study's authors noted that this paradigm shift should not be considered all doom and gloom for workers. Rather, they noted that this is an opportunity for rethinking skills and training, marking a new phase of employee development and business strategy.

This is supported by a recent McKinsey study showing that AI is more likely to enhance jobs than replace them.""As this technology becomes commonplace in the workforce, new employee skills will be in demand to support areas including business strategy and AI management,"" the Cognizant and Oxford Economics authors wrote. ""Reskilling programs, once seen as a tactical add-on to an employee's career path, will become an essential part of the workday, with time allocated for training and education.""

Translating documents overnight, studying files for hours on end, time-consuming research into contracts – many lawyers have already had to deal with unpleasantly tedious tasks in the course of their career. At least some of these tasks can be increasingly automated. Legal tech applications are not a new topic for lawyers, but since the OpenAI bot ChatGPT began its triumphal march just over a year ago, applications with artificial intelligence (AI) have received a further boost.


""The offerings are surprisingly powerful when it comes to summarising legal texts and documents and explaining them in a structured way,"" says Tom Braegelmann. The lawyer from the law firm Annerton has been involved with the use of technology in law firms for many years and has himself worked for a legal tech company for a time. A hundred-page decision by the Federal Network Agency, for example, can be summarised by ChatGPT in a very short time – with one major caveat: ""You have to check all the results,"" emphasises Braegelmann. ""However, familiarising yourself with the facts of a case is quicker if you already have a summary.""


The business law firm Allen & Overy uses several AI tools, including Harvey, which has been specifically trained for the legal context. Harvey, like the latest version of ChatGPT, is based on OpenAI's GPT-4. ""You can ask Harvey legal questions such as 'What is the legal nature of banking secrecy in German law?' and have it provide sources to verify the result, similar to the traditional process without the use of AI,"" explains Associate Niklas Germayer. Feeding the AI with existing documents is also becoming more effective. In this process, search results are not created based on the AI model in connection with the internet but primarily based on the information in the document itself. The tool is significantly more powerful in using GPT-4 compared to its predecessors.

Broader application

However, Germayer also believes that careful monitoring is essential. For Alexander Behrens, Partner at Allen & Overy, the rapid developments in AI are a double-edged sword: ""On the one hand, the applications are a good help. But of course, some lawyers are worried that the technology will one day completely replace legal work."" But that is a long way off. The lawyers are convinced that even powerful AI models cannot replace legal work at the present time. Rather, it is about supporting and automating highly standardised activities.


Eric Wagner, Partner at Gleiss Lutz, sees the broader range of applications as the greatest advance of the latest generation of AI tools. ""Until now, many legal tech offerings have been heavily focussed on individual areas of application such as text recognition or data analysis,"" he says. The new generation can fulfil different tasks without the lawyer having to switch between different applications. ""This increases acceptance within the team and leads to more routine handling – and therefore better results,"" says Wagner.


In the future, technology could lead to law firms increasingly switching to fixed prices.
Tom Braegelmann, Annerton

Marc Geiger heads the Legal Operations & Business Technologies department at the law firm. Around 80 employees work there, providing training on AI and legal tech, for example, but also developing their own digital solutions and keeping an eye on cyber security. For Geiger, the latest generation of applications with generative AI is a kind of universal platform: ""Lawyers use them like an assistance system. The interest and potential applications are huge.""


AI could change not only the way lawyers work but also the way lawyers are paid. Until now, the hourly rate has been the benchmark for payment for legal services. However, AI is particularly good at preparing lengthy routine tasks, such as translations. This reduces the billable hours. ""In the future, the technology could lead to law firms increasingly switching to fixed prices,"" expects Tom Braegelmann.

Clients ask for AI tools

AI tools have not yet reached the point where it is possible to realise significant efficiency gains, says Eric Wagner from Gleiss Lutz. However, the better the systems become, the greater the pressure for change in the market. On the one hand, law firms have high investment costs to acquire the technologies. But how much is a client prepared to pay if at least some of the pleadings have been created by an algorithm? ""There is currently an imbalance,"" admits Wagner.


However, he believes that some mandates could probably no longer be won without investing in new technologies: ""Many clients specifically ask in pitches which legal tech and AI tools the law firm uses."" Wagner would not rule out that the price structure will shift more towards fixed prices that include the use of AI tools for certain use cases. ""We may even get to the point where clients accept a certain error rate in the interest of increased efficiency.""


AI does not know law. It is good at interpreting data.
Marc Geiger, Gleiss Lutz

It will not work without lawyers in the future – however, the areas where they can provide added value are shifting. For instance, linguistic clarity may become less important as a differentiation criterion. This is because an AI can handle the linguistically appealing presentation of facts. ""The performance will lie in using a suitable AI tool, for example, for repetitive tasks to work more efficiently and create space in other areas,"" expects Wagner. AI ultimately remains to be a technology. ""AI can't do law. It can interpret data well,"" emphasizes his colleague Marc Geiger.

It's challenging without data

However, if an issue cannot be broken down into data, AI quickly reaches its limits: ""Some issues have to be assessed without a database. This then requires empirical knowledge,"" says Braegelmann. ""Lawyers are experienced in dealing with authorities, they know the local labour, insolvency and other courts, and they can mediate in disputes between shareholders. Clients will continue to be willing to pay for this added value,"" the lawyer is certain.


Despite all the interest in the new possibilities – lawyers can't just try it out like private users do with ChatGPT. Data protection and legal professional privilege place strict limits on the use of AI tools. At Allen & Overy, AI tools are programmed in such a way that they do not store any data; the principle is called ""zero data retention"". ""The tool does not learn from the data,"" explains Partner Behrens.


Today's AI models are no longer primarily concerned with large volumes of data, explains Marc Geiger from Gleiss Lutz. This is due to the way they work: Early approaches in machine learning used numerical tables to represent words. The tools could not map relationships between words – for example, they did not recognise when two words had a similar meaning. In large language models (LLM), which are used today, such relationships are represented by word embeddings using vectors. Put simply, words that have similar meanings are closer together in the vector space than others. ""With machine learning, the principle was: the more data, the better the algorithm,"" says Geiger. ""With LLM tools, on the other hand, you can also improve the quality of the results by weighting certain vectors differently. The amount of data is less decisive."" Many projects are currently underway at large law firms, in particular, to test use cases for artificial intelligence. Hogan Lovells, for example, has just developed the chatbot ""Eltemate Craig"" with its legal tech subsidiary Eltemate. It should be able to draft legal texts and summarise large amounts of information in a structured manner. KPMG Law is also working with its own AI-supported chatbot.

Between fax machines and legal tech tools

However, the world of justice is not regarded as a digital pioneer; hardly any other sector still uses the fax machine so intensively. In order to establish AI on a broad scale, lawyers need to utilise the technology. ""There have been a few cases in recent years where law firms have euphorically invested in legal tech tools that were then left untouched by employees,"" reports Braegelmann, who also offers training courses on the use of AI for lawyers. This reluctance was often due to uncertainty or fear of embracing something new. However, nobody needs to worry about being exposed by artificial intelligence: ""The algorithm can do no more than the lawyer. But it can help lawyers save time.""


At Allen & Overy, 800 to 900 of the 3,000 lawyers currently use an AI application every day. ""That's a pretty good rate,"" says Behrens. A simple trick has driven the usage figures up significantly: ""The first AI tools ran in a separate browser and received far less attention,"" recalls Behrens. In the meantime, the law firm has developed its own AI application called ""Contract Matrix"" and integrated it directly into Word.


It's not about bringing the user to the technology. It is more promising if the technology comes to the user.
Alexander Behrens, Allen & Overy

Access to the contract negotiation tool, which the law firm also provides to clients, has significantly increased since then, and the tool can be more efficiently utilized in transactions. For Behrens, this is an important realization: ""It's not about bringing the user to the technology. It is more promising when the technology comes to the user.""

Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) analysis shows that AI job displacement will be gradual, with only 1.6% of worker wages in the US economy capable of automation and 23% of those tasks feasible to automate.

With the advent of artificial intelligence technologies such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard, which can perform a variety of tasks with a single text prompt, these fears have become even more profound. What's more worrying is that even the creators of these technologies, such as OpenAI's Sam Altman, have previously suggested that the job market is unlikely to stay the same as generative AI technology improves.Golman Sachs had previously estimated that AI could lead to the automation of around 25% of the global workforce in the coming years, while a McKinsey analysis found that nearly 50% of all work will be done by AI by 2025, TechCrunch reported. In addition, an analysis by the University of Pennsylvania, NYU and Princeton previously found that ChatGPT alone could impact nearly 80% of the workforce.Now, a new analysis by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has analyzed not only if a job can be replaced by AI but also if it is economically feasible to automate such tasks. The 45-page study found that only 1.6% of worker wages in the US economy are capable of automation and only 23% of those tasks (0.4% of the total tasks) are feasible enough to automate.&nbsp;Talking about the potential of new age AI technology, the study noted, ""“Machines will steal our jobs” is a sentiment frequently expressed during times of rapid technological change. Such anxiety has re-emerged with the creation of large language models (e.g. ChatGPT, Bard, GPT-4) that show considerable skill in tasks where previously only human beings showed proficiency""“Computer vision, as it stands today, only has an economic advantage in 23% of vision tasks at the firm-level and barriers to AI-as-a-service deployments exist, there will most likely need to be a sharp reduction in cost for computer vision to replace human labor… Even with a 50% annual cost decrease, it will take until 2026 before half of the vision tasks have a machine economic advantage and by 2042 there will still exist tasks that are exposed to computer vision, but where human labor has the advantage.” the study stated.On the possibility of AI job loss, the study noted, “Our findings suggest that AI job displacement will be substantial, but also gradual – and therefore there is room for policy and retraining to mitigate unemployment impacts.”&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'cssSelector': ['h1', '.summary h2']}",,,Can AI take away your job?

PARIS:
      Recent advances in artificial intelligence look set to change or render obsolete millions of jobs. While this prospect is raising fears among workers, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) believe that AI is unlikely to put too many humans out of work in the immediate future.
This is largely because artificial intelligence tools are too costly for companies to deploy on a large scale. It would not be in their financial interest to dispense with certain roles that are deemed suitable for automation.
MIT researchers came to this conclusion after examining the cost-effectiveness of computer vision software – computer programs that extract meaningful information from images, videos and other visual inputs.
The academics found that employees who perform similar tasks are a far better investment for the companies that employ them than the AI tools that are designed to replace them.AdChoicesADVERTISING
We find that only 23% of the wages being paid to humans for doing vision tasks would be economically attractive to automate with AI. Humans are still the better economic choice for doing these parts of jobs, one of the study’s co-authors, Neil Thompson, told TechCrunch.
Since the very concept of computer vision may seem rather abstract to the average person, the academics use the example of a baker to illustrate their point.
A baker spends around 6% of their time checking the quality of food, according to data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. This aspect of the job could, in theory, easily be automated by AI.
In the case of a bakery employing five people, each with an annual salary of $48,000, automating quality control could save US$14,000 a year.
But, deploying an AI tool to perform this task would cost US$165,000. On top of that, the bakery’s owners would have to pay US$122,840 a year to maintain the computer system. Which just goes to show that this is not a financially astute decision.AdChoicesADVERTISING
While this study has methodological limitations, it does provide some answers as to the potential impact of artificial intelligence on employment.
Several reports, including one by the consulting firm McKinsey, estimate that this technology will wipe out many jobs. This has given rise to a feeling of unease – and even anxiety – among some workers, who fear their skills will be made redundant.
For the time being, however, it seems that unemployment is unlikely to rise significantly as a result of AI, even if there is no doubt that the technology will rapidly spread through companies in all kinds of sectors.Stay current - Follow FMT on WhatsApp, Google news and TelegramWhatsAppGoogle NewsTelegram",,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/leisure/2024/01/26/why-ai-is-unlikely-to-steal-your-job-anytime-soon/'}","For now, it’s not in the financial interest of companies to do away with certain jobs deemed suitable for automation. © OpenAI&#8217;s DALL·E / ETX MajelanPARIS: Recent advances in artificial intelligence look set to change or render obsolete millions of jobs.

They discovered that AI is too costly to replace jobs, and only 23% of workers, assessed in terms of dollar salaries, could be efficiently replaced. In other circumstances, people performed the task more efficiently because AI-assisted visual identification is costly to install and maintain..The adoption of AI across businesses surged last year after OpenAI's ChatGPT and other generative tools demonstrated the technology's capabilities. Tech companies ranging from Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. in the United States to Baidu Inc. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. in China launched new AI services and increased development plans at a rate that some industry executives said was too rapid. Concerns regarding AI's influence on jobs have long persisted..&quot;'Machines will steal our employment' is a common concern stated during periods of fast technological progress. &quot;Such anxiety has resurfaced with the creation of large language models,&quot; the researchers from MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory said in the 45-page report titled Beyond AI Exposure. &quot;We find that only 23% of worker compensation 'exposed' to AI computer vision would be cost-effective for firms to automate because of the large upfront costs of AI systems.&quot;.Computer vision is a branch of artificial intelligence that allows machines to extract meaningful information from digital photographs and other visual inputs. Its most common applications include object identification systems for self-driving cars and photo categorization on smartphones..Computer vision has the best cost-benefit ratio in categories such as retail, transportation, and warehousing, all of which are dominated by Walmart Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. According to MIT research, it is also practical in the healthcare environment. According to the authors, a more aggressive AI rollout, mainly through AI-as-a-service subscription options, might scale up and make additional applications more viable..The MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab supported the study, which employed online surveys to collect data on about 1,000 visually-assisted activities from 800 jobs. Only 3% of such jobs can be automated cost-effectively today, but the researchers predict that figure will climb to 40% by 2030 if data prices decrease and accuracy improves..The sophistication of ChatGPT and rivals such as Google's Bard has reignited concerns about AI taking employment, as the new chatbots demonstrate competency in activities that people were previously capable of completing. The International Monetary Fund stated this week that over 40% of global employment will be affected and that authorities must carefully balance AI's promise with the negative consequences..Many debates at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week centered on AI's potential to replace workers. Mustafa Suleyman, co-founder of Inflection AI and Google's DeepMind, described AI systems as &quot;fundamentally labor-replacing tools.&quot;.Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

SingPost powers up workforce with generative AI from Google Cloud

Singapore Post is working with Google Cloud to empower SingPost employees with easy-to-use AI-powered tools, and help them boost productivity, streamline repetitive tasks, and foster seamless collaboration with external partners and customers.
Noel Singgih, group CIO at SingPost, said their engagement with Google Cloud to develop an AI solution—through their joint AI Trailblazers initiative with the Singapore government—gave us the confidence to embark on the next step of this journey with them as our strategic cloud services provider. 
“Google Cloud’s industry leadership in responsible AI, sustainable technology innovation, and cybersecurity will be core tenets in establishing SingPost as a trusted and customer-centric logistics leader in the Asia-Pacific region,” said Singgih.
SingPost has migrated all IT workloads hosted in its on-premises data centers to Google Cloud and is in the process of harmonizing and consolidating its technology stack, establishing a robust and secure foundation to power accelerated AI-driven innovation. 
This strategic move has not only yielded substantial cost savings of 30% in IT operations, but also allows SingPost to take advantage of Google Cloud’s AI-optimized infrastructure, purpose-built to handle complex AI workloads, while ensuring cost-efficiency, scalability, and sustainability. 
To further safeguard its enterprise data and applications, SingPost is also deploying Google Cloud’s BeyondCorp Enterprise platform to enforce zero trust security principles like multi-factor authentication and device verification, ensuring that only authorised staff can access proprietary company information.
A successful participant in the AI Trailblazers initiative, SingPost has developed an AI solution prototype to streamline its eCommerce logistics operations. 
This solution eliminates the administrative burden of manually re-entering partner and supplier information from trade documents—including those with handwritten inputs—into its database. It also liberates employees from the drudgery of digging through document archives to find the information they need, enabling them to focus on making strategic decisions and delivering high-quality customer interactions.
SingPost’s AI solution transforms unstructured data from trade documents into a searchable repository, with a gen AI-powered chat interface that comprehends natural language queries and surfaces accurate and relevant information.
In collaboration with Google Cloud, SingPost will scale the use of its solution, with the goal of optimizing supply chain orchestration across its logistics network and facilitating faster deliveries. 
Additionally, SingPost is leveraging Vertex AI to explore solutions for several other use cases, including automating internal legal document reviews and providing more personalized interactions to enhance customer care.
SingPost is replacing previous legacy productivity tools with Duet AI in Google Workspace to help its employees write, visualize, organize, and connect more meaningfully. With Duet AI, SingPost’s sales teams can produce memos and presentation decks with greater velocity in response to requests for proposals (RFPs), while marketing and customer support teams can speed up marketing copy development and reduce average response times to customer inquiries.
Mark Micallef, Google Cloud managing director in Southeast Asia, said that by investing in AI development and collaborator platforms with built-in privacy, control, security, and compliance capabilities, SingPost is empowering every employee—regardless of their role or function—to identify and capitalise on new opportunities for work optimisation. 
“This serves as a strong example of how a large enterprise can move swiftly to extract diverse benefits from gen AI adoption,” said Micallef.

The company piloted a lot of strides in customer relationship management when it was founded, some 24 years back (along with SaaS and cloud) and did it so well, everybody knows Salesforce as “the CRM company” today. With AI, it wants to do the same thing, in fact, it wants to champion the cause and by extension, help its customers stay ahead of the curve. It’s all connected. The numbers seem to suggest, it’s winning. Senior company executives say compared to peers like Microsoft, Salesforce has accomplished a lot more in a much shorter span of time and so, the aim —now— is to be the “fastest to 50 billion [in revenue].” The company may have its roots in San Francisco, California, but its India story is starting to get a lot more interesting and while you may not have considered India as very tech-savvy in the past, in the present day and into the future, it is cruising. No wonder, Salesforce is looking at India as a big opportunity both in terms of talent and growth. Speaking exclusively to FE.com’s Saurabh Singh, Arun Kumar Parameswaran, Senior Vice President &amp; Managing Director, Salesforce India, takes us through the journey on the sidelines of the launch of the company’s latest State of Data and Analytics industry report. Excerpts. Salesforce in India – what is the story so far? Arun: In India, we&#039;ve quadrupled in size in the last four years from 2,500 to 10,000. We have centres of excellence in Hyderabad. We do a lot of cutting-edge engineering development work for our customers. We see a huge growth story in India. I think there&#039;s a generational opportunity. Honestly, in the last 30 years, I haven&#039;t seen a demand pipe that is this robust, and that cuts across all industries, all segments, and all customer sizes. I&#039;ve seen secular growth trends in the past, but they were specific to certain industries, like when you saw the whole wave around 4G happening, it was predominantly a telco wave. Then there were waves around financial services, but we’ve never seen anything that is so massive in terms of the breadth of demand, if you will. And I think that the country is also uniquely positioned with a lot of the macroeconomic environmental factors in our favour. It almost feels like there&#039;s the rest of the world and there&#039;s India, a public digital infrastructure stack that is second to none today. In fact, I think we&#039;re leading the world in terms of what we’ve done building that digital infrastructure to scale. And that&#039;s helping every company whether you&#039;re a 10-man organisation, or a 10,000-man organisation, aspire to be digital. Also ReadIndia is critical for our success, working hard on affordable foldables: Samsung Mobile head TM Roh   Salesforce in India – where do you go from here? Arun: We are the largest Salesforce entity outside the US. The beauty is that Salesforce is looking at India, not just from one dimension, but multiple dimensions. One dimension is the talent pool. The second dimension is the market itself. If you think about the different parts of the world, the macroeconomic picture is so dire when you look at it and then [when] you look at India, it feels like you&#039;re in two different universes altogether. India has a very strong macroeconomic foundation and hopefully it&#039;s our decade. From a company perspective, there&#039;s a very clear view that we should be front and centre [here]. If you [can] solve problems for India, that pretty much works everywhere in the world. That’s the other incentive for the company to continue to innovate for India, or Bharat, which is again turning out to be an interesting, almost secular trend by itself. That then becomes a complete pivot into the rest of the world, if you will. It’s always encouraging to get this kind of view from leaders like yourself. It&#039;s fantastic how far India has come and how well Salesforce is doing. Do you want to take us through the report now. We can’t help but point out, it’s coming at an interesting moment in time. Arun: You’re right. Our latest State of Data and Analytics report comes at a time where it couldn&#039;t be more relevant because at the end of the day, data powers everything from a machine learning and an AI perspective. And trusted data is probably the biggest challenge that every C-suite executive is grappling with. We&#039;ve surveyed over 10,000 folks in the line of analytics, IT, and business leaders from 18 countries. We had about 300 odd people from India who participated in this. We found that there&#039;s an absolute gold rush for making sure that people have their ducks lined up in a row in this space because more than anything, they are worried about what they&#039;re going to miss out on. More than 92 percent of the leaders believe that advancements in AI, specifically generative AI, make data management a much higher priority than where it was before. More than 75 percent are worried about how competition is going to have a leg-up on them, if they don&#039;t have the initiatives to drive the insights from this data with AI. A lot of questions are coming up on security and trust as well. The other big piece is that generative AI is cool in a lot of ways, but it can also provide a lot of inaccurate information. And so, data accuracy, how do you cut out the noise, how do you remove bias, a lot of these things are top of the mind, as people start putting this to meaningful use that is much beyond writing poems and creating marketing campaigns. The moment you want to start trusting AI to be as autonomous as you think it can be, now, you have to worry about ten other pieces. I also think that governance is top of mind. What is your position on AI regulation as a company? Arun: We&#039;re one of the top five software companies in the world and so, we get invited to a lot of conversation in this area. In fact, I know that our CEO Marc Benioff and a few others were invited to the White House when they had a closed-door conversation around AI, and what&#039;s happening in the larger domain. We participated in a similar one in the UK. And so, we&#039;re part of a lot of these conversations around ethical use of AI, in fact, we have an executive whose role is just to make sure that as we embed AI into the core of everything that we do, we are acutely focused on also making sure that we&#039;re not crossing lines that we should not. I think it&#039;s still very early days, in terms of where this is heading from a regulation perspective. People and companies are rushing to deploy and use AI, a subject that’s still new and evolving— and prone to risk. What is Salesforce doing to minimise that risk? Arun: We&#039;re not saying AI just for AI’s sake. We&#039;re saying, think about AI in combination with data and trust, and more importantly, customer relationship management (CRM), because at the end of the day, the heart of all your customer data sits in your CRM platform. Our view is that the best answers you&#039;re going to get from AI, generative or predictive, are going to come from a combination of data that you trust the most, which is your customer data, which we as a SaaS vendor, have an obligation and a commitment to make sure we take care of. It doesn&#039;t matter whether you&#039;re a Mayura Bakery in Bangalore, or you&#039;re the National Security Agency. Both these customers get the same level of security, trust, and enforceability from a Salesforce platform perspective. Today, we make probably two trillion predictions per day from a predictive AI perspective on our Einstein platform at Salesforce. When we take you on that journey, it will include multiple things including your own large language model or it could be a public LLM that you&#039;re using, the way we work with that is we don&#039;t keep copies of your data. We will only look for veracity of the data and the accuracy of the information we&#039;re providing. Every customer in the world has access to the same capabilities across the board. It&#039;s a huge differentiator for us. And particularly in the world that we come in, where you have people who are sitting on versions that are five generations behind, our promise is we will keep you current, and we&#039;ll keep you where you need to be. Your views on India’s AI-readiness, adoption, opportunities, and challenges? Arun: Because of India’s inherent scale, we will find unique use cases and solutions that the world will probably not see or not want. That will propel us to the top of the chart. A lot of the demographics in India are crying for help on automation and AI is going to solve a lot of problems that otherwise we would have no way of solving. So, in some ways, I would almost say that our demographics are going to force adoption faster. What we don&#039;t know is at our scale, how would the pricing economics work. I think that&#039;s the piece that needs to be seen. Right now, if you look at all the use cases, a lot of it is in customer service, a lot of it is around content, how can we make things autonomous, etc. If you truly start trying to solve some of India’s problems at scale, that&#039;s going to put a lot of stress on the resources. The cost of being able to deliver that is what we need to see as we evolve into those large-scale solutions that will solve large problems for the society here in India. Then we&#039;ll have to see how economically viable it becomes for us to do it. It’s still early. But I foundationally believe that, like a lot of the leapfrogs that we&#039;ve seen in technology over the last 20 years, India will leapfrog in a number of ways because of this AI growth curve that we&#039;re seeing. Also ReadFE Exclusive: Vivo wants to not chase numbers, but shoot for the sun with X100 series I don&#039;t know the exact numbers, but India probably already has more users on DigiYatra, than CLEAR has had in the US over the last 10 years. I use CLEAR because I travel a lot to the US and it makes my life so much simpler at security checkpoint, but I&#039;ve been paying USD 150 for that service. And I am thinking about what we&#039;ve developed with DigiYatra, here in India. You can imagine that, in less than 12 months, if we&#039;ve done more at essentially the cheapest cost possible to make this a free public digital infrastructure, here&#039;s a classical example of where we bought AI to solve a problem at large scale that India represents. It’s not like we are saying that at some point we&#039;re going to start charging for this either. It looks like it&#039;s going to be a free service, primarily because we want to solve the congestion problem in airports and enhance customer experiences. We can see how AI is helping to solve large-scale problems, that otherwise, we had no other way of solving other than throwing more bodies at the problem, which can become a huge challenge at some point. DigiYatra for me is AI at work, every day. What is the talent pool like in India right now in terms of people who are educated and capable in this space? More importantly, are you hiring? [At a time when Big Tech layoffs are becoming increasingly commonplace, we believe that’s a pertinent question.] Arun: One of the good things that&#039;s happened in India over the last five years is the number of data scientists, data analysts and people who can work on data models has absolutely gone through the roof. So, the foundation from a data perspective is there. If you were to think about innovation in generative AI, core large language models, a lot of that is still predominantly, Silicon Valley, West Coast [between Silicon Valley and Seattle] that probably comprises 80 percent of the innovation that&#039;s happening today. But I think India is catching up fast and furious. We&#039;re hiring across the board with a very clear view that every platform of Salesforce will have these capabilities embedded in it. When mobile became the latest fad, 12-14 years back, we said, we&#039;ll make every platform fully mobile capable. When we got into predictive AI, 5-6 years back, we said, okay, Einstein is going to be embedded in everything we build, and therefore, everybody who comes on board should have these capabilities. And you&#039;ll see that we will continue to hire in this space across a multitude of capabilities. In terms of where that talent is, I&#039;d probably say in early stages, but again, you know how this country works, people spot a gold rush and then everyone will be heading in that direction. So, in a couple of years’ time, I think we will start seeing meaningful contributions and innovations coming out of India. Conversely, what is your take on concerns that AI will take away jobs? Arun: Every technology shift that&#039;s come in the last 30 years, has come with the first worry that it&#039;s going to take away jobs. If you look at what&#039;s happened subsequently, it&#039;s not just not taken away jobs, if anything, it has spurred an entire generation of new jobs. What you can expect is a little bit of volatility in the short and medium term. Automation has always gone after low-value repeatable jobs that can be replaced. What AI is threatening to do is exactly that, which is, if you&#039;re in a space where you&#039;re doing something that&#039;s of relatively low value that the system can accomplish, you should expect that it is going to be taken over. But it doesn&#039;t mean that there is no role for those people. There is still going to be a whole bunch of jobs that will be created for managing those platforms. Yes, if you&#039;re in an industry where you&#039;re doing certain things that can be automated at scale, then there is going to be disruption. But there are also going to be new roles and new jobs that are going to be created over the course of the next 3-5 years. If you look at the stages of AI, today, it&#039;s predominantly a user intervention driven AI model, and the future being autonomous general insurance at some point, which people are saying anywhere between 2027-2030. That&#039;s a very long road to getting to a point where you&#039;re going to have Autonomous General Intelligence (AGI) come into play in the mainstream. In that process, we will see roles and jobs evolve, new capabilities, and more enablement for people to take up some of these things and move away from what they know is going to get disrupted. Also ReadWill ChatGPT take your job? Indian engineers have nothing to worry about, Salesforce’s Deepak Pargaonkar says And what about concerns of AI becoming larger than life and taking over humanity— from reel to real? Arun: Technology has been and will continue to remain a force for good. And I think the benefits far outweigh the downside risks of how technology can be used. But companies need to take a step back on behalf of their customers and have conversations around security, trust, the ethical use of AI, and put guardrails to make sure that this technology [remains] a force for good. That is why a lot of companies, like Salesforce, are taking very measured, but very agile steps to make sure that our customers benefit from this revolution but are also secure in making decisions. You can&#039;t underscore the threat, but I would want to point backwards to history and say this is not the first time we&#039;ve seen a technology that has the potential not just to be a force for good, but also to bring unintended consequences. We&#039;ve always found a way to make sure that it stays on the right side of that line. There have been guardrails around how technology has evolved and deployed in the past, and there&#039;s no reason to believe that we can&#039;t do the same with AI. We&#039;re in the very early stages of a hype curve, but the only difference between this hype curve and the rest is that this can get past the chasm of uncertainty or where people don&#039;t get the benefits, because the benefits are going to be obvious in this case. We will see some very striking benefits for businesses and therefore it will quickly cross the chasm and go into a quick adoption curve. This technology revolution is very different from what we&#039;ve seen in the past, and it&#039;s going to come at a cost that is going to be very affordable, at least from what we can see right now. How do you see (and deal with) competition, which is frankly starting to get tighter in this space? Arun: I go back to the famous Intel CEO [Andy Grove], quote, “Paranoid, alone survive”. We must be paranoid, not just to survive, but to thrive. For a company of our size, complexity, and size of customer base, [if you] look at our growth rates, and look at the pace at which we are innovating, I think that&#039;s truly impressive. But the reason we are there is because we&#039;re constantly paranoid about the fact that if we don&#039;t innovate, we won&#039;t grow. If we won&#039;t grow, we can&#039;t invest, which means we can&#039;t innovate. It&#039;s a vicious cycle. And so, we&#039;re constantly looking at everybody around us and saying, are we innovating ahead of competition? Secondly, as companies grow bigger, the inevitable issues of how easy you are to do business with comes up and it&#039;s something that we&#039;re very acutely focused on inside the company in terms of how we engage with customers, both internally and externally. There are multiple lenses with which we look at competition. At the end of the day, competition is what keeps you alive, keeps you on your toes, and it&#039;s required. The opportunity is so large that there is enough for everybody here.
