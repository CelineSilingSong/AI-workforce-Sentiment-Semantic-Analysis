Report finds negative impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on job seeking candidates and employer brandsPoor candidate experience due to increased use of artificial intelligence during application process has been found to alienate skilled candidates and potentially damage employer brands:
9 in 10 job seekers don’t want to deal with automated CV tools during application stage 

86 per cent of applicants want their CVs assessed by a person, not a machine

Three-quarters of candidates look negatively on employer’s who include AI at point of application
Increased automation of the hiring process is seeing many organisations miss out on top talent at all levels of the organisation, according to new research published by global executive search firm Carmichael Fisher.
Examining the use of AI in typical candidate selection processes, the report’s aim was to identify the areas of hiring that were putting off candidates, as well as where technology could be better utilised.
Authored by James Wright in association with the West East Institute (WEI), the findings of ‘The impact of artificial intelligence within the recruitment industry: defining a new way of recruiting’ paper were presented recently at the Harvard Faculty Club in Boston, USA which played host to the 2019 WEI International Academic Conference on Business, Economics, Management and Finance
Key among them was that nine out of 10 job seekers reject the notion of artificial intelligence being used to parse CV’s. Accordingly, 86 per cent of respondents would prefer their application to be reviewed by a human, rather than an applicant tracking system.
Interestingly, most candidates said they would not want a business to make a hiring decision based on their CV alone. Artificial intelligence is highly effective at streamlining the recruitment process, but unless the applicant’s CV contains sufficient keywords relating to the position being recruited for, it runs the risk of elimination from the process.
Video interviewing has been seen by many as an alternative to the CV, but the research found that this format is equally unpopular among candidates.
As with application parsing technologies, one in five respondents stated a “dislike” of video interviews. Nine in 10 stated they would favour of human interaction over that of a robot with four-fifths of respondents saying that they would normally ask questions about the company in an interview.
This further demonstrates the desire among job seekers for personal communication in hiring, particularly as top talent remains in the driving seat in an increasingly candidate-driven employment market where employment is at a record-high.
The study also asked whether the complete automation of the hiring process was favourable and three-quarters (73 per cent) of respondents stated that it actively worsened their perception of a business and its overall employer brand.
Overall, the research indicates that the traditional recruitment process needs to change – with 84 per cent of candidates labelling the current procedure as ineffective.
Significantly, the study indicates positivity towards AI for its ability to lessen bias and improve diversity levels as part of the wider hiring process. It outlines that the use of smart assessment tools such as gamification and video analysis technologies will deliver more objective assessments of candidates. The report also found that AI will enable faster and fairer applications – reducing fallout rates and improving diversity.
Speaking on the findings of the research, James Wright, Technology Consultant from Carmichael Fisher said:
“The use of AI in the preliminary stages of recruitment is useful to analyse the market and to assist with areas of potential human error such as unconscious bias.
“However, once you have a candidate shortlist, the process becomes intrinsically human and interactive. One of the most common words we found used in the study, when asking participants about using AI for the whole hiring process was ‘impersonal’.
“The role of a recruiter is entirely based on consolidating solid and trustworthy relationships with candidates, getting to know them and their wants and desires. While the future of HR and hiring certainly will welcome AI to take over those more administrative tasks, the role of the human recruiter isn’t going anywhere yet.”

Amir Hever, CEO of UVeye, recalls the company’s beginnings and explains how its range of AI-based products is setting the future standard for automotive manufacturing.
UVeye is a provider of solutions for the automatic external inspection of vehicles. With roots in the security and defence sector, the company’s threat-detection products have already been deployed in numerous high-security facilities around the world.
More recently, UVeye has extended and adapted its product suite for the wider automotive market. Not only is the company’s technology targeted at improving quality standards in garages and dealerships, but also in vehicle manufacturing plants, particularly in end-of-line inspection.

It was after a visit to the premises of a government agency in Tel Aviv that my brother, Ohad, and I had the idea for UVeye – short for Under Vehicle eye.
When we arrived, a security guard stopped us and laid down on the ground next to our car. I asked him what he was doing, and he told me that he was looking to see if I had anything hidden under the vehicle.
“Do you see anything?” I asked. “Nope, I can never see anything,’’ was his swift reply.
From the resulting conversation, I discovered that, even in a country like Israel, where the highest safety standards are expected, and even in a world where digital technology has made leaps and bounds in recent years, many vehicle inspections still consist of rudimentary visual checks.
In the hope of offering an alternative method, in June 2016 we decided to set up UVeye with the aim of utilising high-resolution cameras and AI-based software solutions to take external vehicle inspections into the digital era.

The power of three
Naturally, developing technology that could examine the undercarriage of a vehicle was a good place to start, given our experience at the government agency.
However, after introducing the system as a tool in the security sector, we also saw the potential to take this technology further and bring it to the automotive industry.
Just as the technology could be used to detect threats on a vehicle, so too could it be used to detect faults, maintenance issues, and cosmetic damage.
A key area for its application is during end-of-line inspection in an automotive manufacturing plant, where the vehicle is visually inspected for imperfections.

With AI-based technology, it’s possible to increase the efficiency, objectivity and accuracy of work on vehicle production lines, while enhancing safety and enabling a higher volume of work with the same amount of resources.
By detecting faults at an early stage, we can prevent a potential breakdown and reduce maintenance costs over the lifetime of the vehicle. These faults might include loose bolts, incorrectly routed cables, damage to paintwork or underinflated tyres, to name a few examples.
What’s more, with manual checks, manufacturers not only risk overlooking faults on their vehicles, but also waste time that could be more productively allocated elsewhere in the factory.
An intelligent AI-based system greatly enhances speed and efficiency, improving the flow of vehicles through and out of the plant.
With all of this in mind, we expanded the breadth and capabilities of UVeye’s technology to other areas of a vehicle’s exterior, such as the tyres and bodywork.
Today, we have three product offerings: Helios, Artemis, and Atlas.
Helios
Helios is the undercarriage inspection system, which comes in stationary or portable iterations.



UVeye’s Helios undercarriage inspection system – image courtesy of UVeye.


The hardware comprises five high-resolution cameras in its stationary version and three in the portable version, which capture images from multiple angles to ensure that no spot on the vehicle goes uninspected.
Helios produces a high-resolution image within three seconds of a vehicle driving over the hardware – at speeds of up to 30km/h – and a full analysis within 10 seconds. The system provides the user with a detailed view of the complex componentry on a vehicle’s undercarriage.
UVeye’s deep learning algorithms then process the image to detect anomalies that would otherwise go unnoticed by the human eye.
The technology is able to accurately identify what the individual parts of the undercarriage look like under a wide range of different conditions, such as lighting, stages of wear and tear, and moisture.
If an anomaly is detected, the Helios system automatically alerts the employee at the manufacturing plant and directs them to the exact spot where the anomaly was found.
This makes it easy for them to take action, while reducing the learning curve and other factors like fatigue or stress.



Artemis

Artemis is UVeye’s tyre inspection product. The system comprises two tyre scanners that stand at the side of the vehicle while it drives past at speeds up to 20 km/h.
In a matter of seconds, Artemis reads and recognises the tyre brand, markings, and technical specifications, as well as crucial safety-related data such as tyre condition, pressure, abrasions and to cross-reference the pressure of each tyre to the manufacturer’s standards and measurements, and report any incorrect pressure levels.
The system can even provide a comparison across all of the vehicle’s tyres to determine any irregularities. Presented with this wealth of information and a high-resolution image that highlights any faults or anomalies, technicians at the manufacturing plant can then take the necessary steps to repair or replace the vehicle’s tyres.
It can also bring to their attention any repetitive issues that could be indicative of a larger problem in the production process that must be corrected.
Atlas
The 360° full-body scanner, Atlas, completes UVeye’s portfolio and is used to detect dents, scratches or other cosmetic issues on the vehicle’s upper bodywork.



Atlas – UVeye’s 360° full-body scanner – image courtesy of UVeye.


Atlas looks similar to the large light tunnels found in vehicle factories, taking the form of a bright arc that encircles the vehicle. However, it is far more compact and incorporates the same deep-learning algorithms as Helios and Artemis.
With these, the system can automatically detect scratches as short as a few millimetres, in addition to any broken parts.
Unlike conventional methods, vehicles can be driven or moved on a conveyor through Atlas at up to 20km/h, allowing an uninterrupted flow across the production line. Only if a fault is found does the line need to be stopped.
Working together with Helios and Artemis, the three systems are capable of producing a full 360° scan of the vehicle, so that no fault goes unnoticed.



How does the technology work?
UVeye’s sophisticated piece of technology solution is based on deep learning and image processing. It uses advanced computer-vision algorithms to provide a detailed visual analysis of a vehicle’s exterior and highlights any areas of concern.
Our advanced algorithm meets the challenge of automating anomaly detection for new and unfamiliar ‘first pass’ vehicles. The technology analyses each vehicle part separately, detecting anomalies within seconds – but crucially without the need to reference a previous scan or undercarriage image provided by a vehicle manufacturer.
This allows us to catch issues not simply because it failed to match an ideal image of what the manufacturer thinks their vehicle is supposed to look like, but because we have trained our algorithm to truly understand what the parts of the vehicle look like under a range of conditions.
Everything from the lighting, moisture levels and other natural conditions can change how an image may appear, thus requiring us to train our deep-learning systems to detect and identify anomalies regardless of the situation in the field.
A key aspect of our technology is our ability to compile the images using an area patching methodology that ensures that no part of the vehicle is missed as it moves speedily through the scanners.
Investment for the future

We recently closed our Series B of funding, raising $31m, led by Toyota Tsusho, Volvo Cars, and WR Berkley.
The investment we’ve received from leading automotive strategic partners is an important signal that we believe paves the way for UVeye to become the standard of automotive inspection and safety.
The latest round of funding enables us to continue enhancing our product suite and further expand our international footprint as the emerging global standard for automatic vehicle inspection.

Ticket fares represented 74.5 percent of operating revenue or $125.2 billion. In 2016, the overall category of transportation represented approximately 2.7 percent of the national GDP. Airline passenger traffic is projected to double over the next two decades. Today, leading airlines are exploring how AI can help them keep pace with customer demand and improve operational efficacy, speed and customer satisfaction. To learn how the top four U.S. airlines are using AI, we researched this sector in depth to help answer questions business leaders are asking today, including: How are industry leaders like American Airlines and Delta Airlines using AI today? What have been the tangible results of these airline AI applications? What are the trends across airline AI applications – and how will they impact the industry’s future? This article aims to present a comprehensive look at how the four leading commercial passenger airlines are using AI. Companies were ranked based on 2016 operation revenue sourced from company financial reports.  Before we begin exploring each company, we’ll present the common patterns that emerged throughout our research in this sector. Artificial Intelligence in the Airline Sector – Insights Up Front The most popular AI applications from the top four industry leaders currently using AI appear to be:  AI Assistants: Responding to customer inquiries and responding to voice commands for domestic airline flight info and ticket availability through interactions using natural language (see American Airlines and United below) Smart Logistics: Machine learning algorithms are being applied to data to help automate airline operations. (see Southwest below). Facial Recognition: Facial recognition technology is being used to perform customer identity verification and to match passengers to their luggage through kiosks (see Delta below, and you may want to read our full “facial recognition use-cases” article here) In the full article below, we’ll explore the AI applications of each airline individually. We will begin with American Airlines, the #1 ranking U.S. commercial airline based on 2016 revenue figures. American Airlines In 2017, the current leading airline focused its annual app development competition, HackWars, on “artificial intelligence, drones and augmented and virtual reality” technologies. HackWars IV, was a 24-hour hack-a-thon that reportedly brought out over 700 “designers, developers and IT” professionals. Participants worked in teams aiming to come up with an idea for an innovative app that would be beneficial for both “customers and employees.” The 1st place team, “Team Avatar,” reportedly designed an app that would allow users to determine the size of their luggage in advance of arriving to airport or at a kiosk before proceeding to the gate. The winning team also claimed that their app would allow users to “prepay for any potential expenses” associated with their luggage.  Most likely in an effort to protect the idea, American Airlines did not show a demonstration of how “Team Avatar’s” application would function in the official video. Based on the three categories of interest in the competition, it is possible that the winning app was developed using AI but this is not confirmed. Emerj Founder Dan Faggella states:  “If anything, ‘HackWars’ is a demonstration of AA’s eagerness to innovate (and to let the press know about it), but it’s symbolic of the current nascent stage of AI: Businesses all know they should be applying AI, but are having a hard time finding where and how. If nothing else, AA seems to at least be making the effort, and we hope to see more traction with the firm over the years ahead.” Delta Airlines In May 2017, Delta announced a reported $600,000 investment in four automated self-service bag checking kiosks, including one that will incorporate facial recognition technology. The airline selected Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport to debut the four self-service kiosks, and claims that facial recognition technology will be used to verify customer identity by matching customer faces to passport photos.  While Delta Airlines doesn’t seem to have their own YouTube video of the new self-service bag check kiosk, WCCO – CBS Minnesota explained the technology well in a video from earlier this year:  Evidence of the airlines interest in integrating more self-service and automation into its operations is evident in its previous initiatives such as “ticketing kiosks and check-in via the Fly Delta Mobile app”.  “We are dependent on technology initiatives to provide customer service and operational effectiveness in order to compete in the current business environment. For example, we have made and continue to make significant investments in delta.com, mobile device applications, check-in kiosks, customer service applications, airport information displays and related  initiatives, including security for these initiatives. The performance, reliability and security of the technology are critical to our ability to serve customers.” -2017 Annual Report Delta claims that previous innovations mentioned above have helped to streamline customer traffic in airports and have also “drastically improved customer satisfaction scores.” However, the airline does not specifically provide any data pertaining to customer feedback in the press release.  (Readers interested in customer service AI applications may want to read about the innovative AI kiosk ideas that we covered in our fast food AI uses cases article.) Southwest The airline shows limited evidence of AI implementation, but there is some evidence of Southwest using machine learning to improve operations. Jeff Hamlet, former Director of Air Operations Assurance at Southwest Airlines has stated that he and his team used machine learning techniques such as time series analysis and pattern recognition to enhance their data mining capabilities.  Time series analysis refers to a method for evaluating a series of data points that are ordered according to time. This type of analysis is often used to identify trends or patterns. Hamlet claims that these approaches enabled his team to identify potential flight glitches found in pilots’ data reports. These findings were then relayed to air traffic control at the site of arrival. Hamlet concludes that in this reported instance, contributed to the avoidance of an incident. United Airlines In September 2017, United Airlines announced a collaboration with Amazon Alexa called “United skill.” The app reportedly allows Alexa users to find answers to the most common questions about United flights by communicating through natural language. A screen shot from United’s blog post announcing their Alexa skill Once users add “United skill” to their existing Alexa app, they are able to ask Alexa common questions about flight statuses, flight times and amenities. Though United skill, examples of commands that Alexa can process include: “Alexa, ask United: what is the status of flight 959?”  “Alexa, ask United: does flight 869 have Wi-Fi?” “Alexa, ask United to check me in.” However, the app has some limitations. For example, commands must be phrased in a very specific way and information on certain features such as airline check-in are restricted to domestic flights.  Based on reviews published on Amazon’s website, so far, United skill has had a mixed reception. Some complaints include incorrect flight times and routine misunderstanding of crucial elements of vocal commands such as “flight number.”  As the pioneering airline to integrate Alexa functionality, it is expected that there will be a learning curve. It will be interesting to see what improvements Amazon will make over time and if the collaboration will ultimately prove mutually beneficial for both companies.

Concluding Thoughts on AI in Commercial Airline Sector  AI is being explored in the commercial airline segment of the aviation industry and is being integrated across multiple areas including customer service, airport and flight operations. Airport development will be a particular area of importance according to an annual report published by the International Air Transport Association.  The association anticipates that the cost of airport development, specifically improving and modernizing existing infrastructure and operations, will exceed $1 trillion over the next fifteen years. Therefore, innovation will be a critical building block of these efforts. Specifically, AI and self-service airport kiosks and apps should mesh well into this industry outlook. In aviation, the transmission and translation of data is fundamental to market competition and safe flying. Jeff Hamlet former Director of Air Operations Assurance at Southwest Airlines and Ashok N. Srivastava, the project manager for the Aviation Safety Program at NASA posit that efficient data management is achieved through the continued creation of new algorithms.  These algorithms or apps would be tailored to the new problems that are being reported by pilots, the FAA, and others involved in aeronautics space. Policies and procedures that affect the transmission of data are of fundamental importance to the future of machine learning in aeronautics.  Thus, we can anticipate that machine learning algorithms will continue to play an important role in how leading airlines translate their data interpretation into valuable outcomes for their companies.  It is also important to consider the economic impact as it pertains to job growth. As a bustling multi-billion dollar industry, it is anticipated that over the next 20 years we will see widespread and lasting growth in the commercial aviation job market. Global economic expansion has contributed to airlines “expanding their fleets and flight schedules” to satisfy growing consumer demand. In 2016, the aviation industry sustained an estimated 67.7 million supply chain jobs  and produced $3.0 trillion in global value-added output. While the leading commercial passenger airlines are relatively early-adopters of AI, industry projections depict a business environment primed for innovation and automation. We will continue to monitor how AI emerges throughout the industry as we anticipate wider implementation in the coming years.   Header image credit: Infosys Related Posts Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Elderly Care RoboticsThe number of persons aged 60 or above is expected to grow from 962 million… Artificial Intelligence at UBS - Current Applications and InitiativesUBS is a Swiss multinational investment banking and financial services company ranked 30th on S&P… Stock Brokerage Firms and Artificial Intelligence - Current ApplicationsThis article aims to explore the current state of artificial intelligence applications in stock brokerage… Artificial Intelligence for Credit Card Companies - Current ApplicationsCredit card companies could make use of AI applications across multiple business areas.

Artificial Intelligence Reveals Second Playwright’s Contributions to Shakespeare’s ‘Henry VIII’
Scholars have long suspected the play, written in 1613, was a collaborative effort. Now, an algorithm has mapped out who wrote what

                William Shakespeare (left) and John Fletcher (right) both contributed to Henry VIII, a new study suggests.
              Public domain



In the summer of 1613, an early performance of William Shakespeare’s Henry VIII—then titled All is True—found the Globe Theater packed with spectators. Cannon fire sounded as the play’s eponymous monarch walked onstage toward the end of the first act, captivating audience members to such an extent that they failed to notice a fiery prop landing on the theater’s thatched roof. Within an hour, the Globe had been reduced to ash.
New research suggests Shakespeare didn’t pen the history play-turned-tragedy by himself. Since literary analyst James Spedding first raised the possibility in 1850, scholars have speculated that Henry VIII was actually a collaboration between the Bard and John Fletcher, who succeeded Shakespeare as house playwright of the King’s Men acting company. Now, an algorithm created by Petr Plecháč of Prague’s Czech Academy of Sciences has revealed that the inflammatory cannon scene—and roughly half of the play—were likely written by Fletcher. Plecháč’s findings are published in the pre-print server arXiv.

“The scenes that are written by Fletcher are creaky,” Grace Ioppolo, a Shakespearean scholar at the University of Reading, told BBC News’ Tim Masters in 2015, when the rebuilt Globe Theater was preparing to host the play once again. “You can see in some scenes it doesn't have that Shakespearean touch that we are used to.""
Researchers have used machine learning to identify distinguishing differences in authors’ voices before, according to a press release. Plecháč trained an algorithm to recognize Shakespeare’s and Fletcher’s writing styles by feeding it four of each playwright’s individual works. The algorithm learned to distinguish differences in the duo’s rhythm and word choice, and was then put to the task of combing through Henry VIII line-by-line.



    
      Shakespearean qualities appear above the mid-line in purple, while qualities associated with Fletcher show up below the line in green.
    
    
      Petr Plecháč


“This turned out to be a very reliable discriminator for both authors’ styles. When applied to the text of Henry VIII, the result clearly indicated that both authors were involved,” Plecháč tells the Guardian’s Alison Flood.
As Flood notes, the algorithm even ruled out another speculated collaborator: playwright Philip Massinger.
The new study visualizes the algorithm’s analysis as a purple and green graph. Shakespearean qualities appear above the mid-line in purple, and qualities associated with Fletcher show up below the line in green. Instead of limiting the assessment to an either-or distinction, the algorithm accounts for such factors as transitions and truly collaborative sections.
Per the paper, Shakespeare probably wrote the play’s first two scenes, while Fletcher took the next four. But starting at line 2081, the algorithm found that the playwrights shared writing duties—at least until line 2200, when the Bard’s voice returns to prominence.
This analysis provides granular evidence for co-authorship, but as Spedding noted in 1850, a gut feeling and close reading can also reveal shifts in style.
“There are certain scenes when you suddenly think ‘this is Shakespeare’—the writing is richer,” Mark Rosenblatt, director of the 2015 production, told BBC News at the time. “You feel you are in the hands of a truly great writer as opposed to a very fine writer.”

Human beings have an innate need for being productive. There are times when regular tasks can become repetitive and boring if not done quickly or differently. The popular phrase “working like a robot” holds extremely true in the case of AI. Maybe not as negative for an actual robot, but AI is at a stage where it can be used for dangerous or repetitive tasks. 
Using AI can benefit people and organizations by getting accurate data analysis with no trace of human error. As AI development increases multifold, the future can be quite ‘exciting’ with AI taking over monotonous tasks for you. 
5 Monotonous Tasks AI Will Take Over For You:
1. AI becomes a Voice, Chat Assistant
The transition from producer oriented to customer-oriented businesses has created a whole new dynamic for AI. There is a reason this is the first point. AI has already become a personal assistant for people. Reliance on Amazon’s Alexa or iPhone Siri is proof enough to say that AI has seeped into our lives tremendously. Millennials are doing 50% of their online searches via Voice Search and most enterprises can capitalize on this. 
IBM has developed a voice integration tool that responds to queries related to reports using Voice. This way an enterprise can capitalize on integrating well with Voice assistants that a consumer is getting used to. 
Sephora, personal care products company, uses a colour matching chatbot where the user can upload a picture of celebrity lipstick colour and the bot finds the exact one for them. 
Online fashion stores remembering your preferences and suggesting new ones to you are also great examples of how AI assistant can be used by an enterprise. 
2. AI helps in Managing Data
For sectors that require a lot of data processing, storing and reviving, AI comes to the rescue.  Manually managing data can become highly strenuous and result in more human errors for complex processing. When you automate these processes with AI, it gives the employees more time to reflect on their strategies and think creatively. 
For example, a marketing firm can find good suggestions for content topics, categorize products and help with search engines. The hours spent on managing these aspects of marketing can be freed with AI taking over. This will leave them with abundant time to work on their creative processes and map out a strategy. 
Another example would be that of the Agriculture sector. AI-based machinery could help bring in more efficiency in crop production and help farmers reduce wastage. Farmers can find more time in finding the right market and selling crops there. Since AI also would be great for weather predictions and farming suggestions based on data acquired, the latter be able to make informed decisions. 
3. AI does your Office Work
How many times have you asked yourself “Is there an easy or quick way to do this?” It’s not just you. Even scientists and researchers have been trying to make products that answer your question. A growing discussion of AI’s use cases proves that it has more than one benefit, and now, even for the usual office work!
AI applications could be useful for repetitive administrative work which just requires checking calendars and inviting for meetings. It could also help in hiring and training of employees by providing suggestions for job descriptions and help trainees conduct regular tasks more effectively. Along with this, AI can help strengthen security by preventing malware attacks. 
An employee can spend more time on their work and productivity and automate repetitive tasks with the help of AI.
4. AI predictions used for Customer Experience
Augmented AI is a fairly new and broad topic but holds relevance in our discussion. Don’t we love it when people remember the smallest details about us and are able to predict what we will enjoy? Just like your best friend, AI also has the same powers. 
Your Netflix suggestions, shopping preferences, spam filters, car ride information, phone customization, etc, are all examples of AI filtering content based on how you like to consume it. Over time, AI notices your behaviour towards certain things and by storing data analyses your likes/dislikes. 
So, when you receive messages from a shopping app saying “We know you’ve been eyeing this, it’s available at half price now,” it’s actually AI understanding you. When you begin to text, the predictions are provided based on observing how you have been texting all through this while. 
On the producer front, AI can help them record customer data and preferences easily and optimize their strategies based on data provided. 
The integration of AI in your apps and regular habits helps you do things at a faster pace. While some argue this is giving AI too much control, there is an option of limiting AI’s access to your data as well. 
5. AI makes you self-sufficient 
Waiting to receive information to go ahead with your regular activities can be quite frustrating. For example, you have Google Maps telling you how much time you’ll take to reach home and which route should you opt for. You don’t have to constantly keep track of what the status of traffic will be at that particular time. If you are in a foreign country, you can easily translate your words and converse with people there. If you wish to teach yourself something, AI could come with great suggestions for your reference. You can learn a language or a new recipe, anything that you don’t want to depend on someone else for. 
In conclusion…
What once was believed to be imagination, now becomes reality. We are already living a world with AI which worked thoroughly in being of use to human beings. There are a lot of ways in which AI can help humans reach their potential and be self-reliant. All you need to know to use AI is – ask the right questions.
