And if you didn’t nab that £700,000 role at Netflix, there are plenty of new positions in the offing, many in surprising areasSupported byAbout this contentJames BallWed 16 Aug 2023 01.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 16 Aug 2023 01.20 EDTShareThe conversation about AI and the workplace is understandably dominated by the downsides – after decades of automation eliminating manufacturing jobs, people in the service sector are worried about being replaced by “robots”.But every technological shift creates as well as destroys jobs. Artificial intelligence – at least in its current iteration, which uses large language datasets to create text, audio and video – is no different. What is, perhaps, surprising is the type of jobs it will create.What kind of jobs are being created right now?The most visible and obvious new roles are for those with the coding and development skills to help build AI models or adapt them for particular purposes. The UK government is actively pursuing AI startups and trying to offer support for them. Google owner Alphabet’s AI division, DeepMind, was founded in London and is still largely based here.These roles aren’t all AI specialists – there are startups dedicated to customising AIs, such as ChatGPT, to be suitable for particular roles in specialist businesses, such as acting as customer service agents for specific industries, or even online sales assistants. Roles specialising in building and creating AI models are attracting the biggest salary premiums, but there are highly skilled and highly paid roles across coding and development.Are new types of jobs being created already?There are drastically different companies dipping their toes into the artificial intelligence revolution, though at this stage on a smaller scale than the new development roles. One that has attracted particular attention is Netflix’s advert for a product manager for its “machine-learning platform”, not least because the listed “compensation” is $300,000 to $900,000 (£240,000 to £710,000).View image in fullscreenStriking Hollywood writers picket outside Paramount Studios in California, in July. Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty ImagesAgainst the backdrop of writers and actors striking partly over the impact of AI on their own roles, the job advert has sparked a significant backlash. It does not specifically mention automation of writing or acting roles but does include phrasing such as “powering innovation” and offering “personalisation to members” with the “highest possible impact”.Not all of the new roles being created by AI offer a top-tier salary, however – the UK’s NewsQuest group advertised an “AI-powered reporter” role in April. The new recruit would “work with an AI system to help write your news articles”, ensuring “all content produced meets legal and ethical standards” while also being required to “meet and exceed page view targets”. The reward for all that was a salary of £22,000.This type of role is based on the idea that, at present, using AI models and getting good results is a skilled task. Using very specific prompts yields better results than vague queries, and users need to have an eye for when an AI model seems to be giving factual information but is in fact “hallucinating” – making up untrue “pseudo facts”.Should we all be looking to retrain for this type of role?We don’t know, but it’s absolutely not a given. These early roles created by AI might not be the strongest long-term prospect. “In a nutshell, I would say it [the best prospect] is not programming, because coding will change,” says Dr Caitlin Bentley, a lecturer in AI education at King’s College London – suggesting that people coding AI may in time see some of their skills superseded.And the new profession of “prompting”– giving AI very precise instructions to get better quality output – might also be shortlived, she suggests. “Prompting, I also think, is going to die soon because AI will get better. Instead, we need better interrogation and translation skills.”So some roles  created by AI are temporary?This is definitely true – AI models rely on being “trained” on real-world data. For language, this data exists naturally, but for other uses (such as identifying traffic lights) AI needs specific instruction.These roles will obviously not last for ever. Self-driving companies, for example, all employ “test drivers” for their driverless cars. But many roles serve a similar purpose, albeit far less visibly. A stark example came in reporting by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism last year showing that Amazon workers in UK warehouses had to sort items in a particular way so that AI could detect it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Global DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: VCG/GettyThese “ghost in the machine” roles tend to be grim ones, focused either on repetitive tasks that AIs are still not sufficiently reliable at, or else on moderation of social media, for the same reasons.Which roles will last?Alison Gow, a former senior executive at Reach (publisher of the Mirror, the Express and many local titles), who has looked into AI in media companies, thinks the best prospects for its long-term use are where the technology is used to enhance or transform existing roles, taking on monotonous tasks.“I’d expect to see AI editor roles being introduced, because someone is ultimately going to need to be responsible, and adding a lens of journalistic scrutiny to generated content,” she says.Gow sets out the optimistic version of events for the news industry: “I expect we’ll see more automation of utility content such as weather reports and match reports in sport, and I’d hope we’ll also see AI used for greater accessibility – so transcription or translation services, or text to audio.”She calls for “real-world workable benefits for a newsroom, not doing shiny stuff for the sake of it”.I’m not technically minded – are there any upsides in this for me?Legal and human resources within businesses might be rife for AI, it has been suggested. Gow is among those who take a different view, suggesting AI might require quite the opposite.There will be many difficult issues to tackle in the courts, in parliament, with unions and other – on matters from copyright law to employment law and beyond – and businesses will need bigger teams to tackle them, she says.View image in fullscreenA humanoid robot helps its human companion in a demonstration at a tech fair in Germany.

In the same way that some companies brought their call centres back to the UK as a mark of premium quality, having actual human customer service agents might similarly become a mark of quality. This could lead to a higher premium being placed on so-called “soft skills” and service skills.Whatever AI does to the workplace, it is not necessarily the people coding the technology who will be the winners.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)The future of workEmploymentWork & careersWorkers' rightsComputingexplainersShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘We pledged not to eat each other’: the family that was shipwrecked for 38 daysRunning Kamala Harris may actually be a political masterstroke for the DemocratsSteve Phillips‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himBody-cam video shows Illinois officer fatally shooting Black woman in faceNursing home owner who left 800 people in warehouse during Hurricane Ida avoids jail time",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s clear that technology professionals will see their roles transformed with artificial intelligence, requiring skills refreshes and learning new approaches. Not so clear is the impact of AI on career prospects for business managers and professionals, with confusing messages about job replacement and usurping of decision-making authority.


The rise of AI, particularly generative AI, is likely to have a strong impact on managerial and professional jobs, an analysis by Rakesh Kochhar of Pew Research suggests. “Jobs with a high level of exposure to AI tend to be in higher-paying fields where a college education and analytical skills can be a plus. Workers with a bachelor’s degree or more (27%) are more than twice as likely as those with a high school diploma only (12%) to see the most exposure.”

Yet, the Pew study also suggests, professionals in more exposed industries do not feel their jobs are at risk – “they are more likely to say AI will help more than hurt them personally. For instance, 32% of workers in information and technology say AI will help more than hurt them personally, compared with 11% who say it will hurt more than it helps.”

PROMOTED
Vittorio Cretella, CIO of Procter & Gamble, doesn’t see AI as replacing human talent, but rather, amplifying those talents. “The continued rise of AI will change the type of work we do, and how we do it, but augmenting rather than replacing human capabilities,” he argues. “We will still need the skills of digitally-savvy, creative human employees who can work effectively with machines.”

AI “will have a profound impact on employees across the whole organization, not only on expert roles such as data science or machine learning engineering,” Cretella points out. “Nearly all employees, regardless of function, will need to get familiar with working with machines, exploring insights and leveraging recommendations which may often be different from what their previous experience would suggest.”

For corporate leaders, the priorities of the AI age must shift to greater investments in “talent and upskilling employees while in-sourcing strategic capabilities such as data science and machine learning engineering,” Cretella advocates. This calls for a balancing act among managers and executives, who “must facilitate the combination of human and machine strengths, creating the organizational focus and culture that encourages continuous learning and the application of AI to improve business outcomes.”

AI, implemented successfully, “will amplify human skills, not simply substitute, or replace them,” says Cretella. “Key human-centric skills include curiosity, creativity, critical thinking, compassion and collaboration.”
Where humans will make the greatest difference is in problem definition, he continues. This consists of “decomposing a problem through key questions and identifying patterns before attempting to define an algorithmic solution. We need leaders and teams to focus on that phase to develop inquisitive skills and dedicate enough time before skipping to solutions.”
P&G’s approach is to “always start from the job to be done, whether is about maximizing media reach, improving manufacturing quality or defining the shelf layout for the best consumer shopping experience,” Cretella illustrates. “What matters is the capability to define the hypothesis and problems, the curiosity to explore data and the power of AI to find the answers.”
It still takes curiosity, and a sense of what people need, to succeed in today’s hyper-competitive economy. “Technology alone does not change things – people do,” he emphasizes. “The future of management is with an AI-savvy generation of business leaders who are curious, have little or no cognitive bias, and understand which organization design, processes, and resources are needed to unleash the power of data and machine learning.”

The majority of teachers believe students are using Artificial Intelligence apps to do their work for them, according to a new study. A survey by education tech firm RM Technology found that two thirds of teachers believe they are regularly receiving work written by AI, with around one in ten teachers (9%) admitting they can't tell the difference between work completed by their pupil and AI programs.

The survey of 500 secondary school teachers revealed that 41% believe there needs to be better regulation of AI with 31% wanting the government to step in to police its use.Mel Parker, a former headteacher who now works as a consultant for RM Technology said: ""There definitely needs to be government regulation, especially from a safeguarding point of view.""And she believes better training is needed in the use of rapidly developing tech.





""They need to know how they can talk to students about good use of AI, what is appropriate use in the classroom, how can they learn from it? How can they get better understanding of concepts - actually what is cheating and what is good practice?""She said there is concern that pupils can use AI to cheat, especially as more than a third of teachers surveyed admit pupils know more about AI than they do.

'I see it as a positive'The concerns of teachers were not shared by students - a mirror survey of pupils found that 68% believe they're getting better grades as a result of AI and 49% say excluding AI would have a negative impact on their learning.Miya Crofts, a 17-year-old sixth former at Greenwood Academy in Birmingham, is a regular user of AI.She said: ""In terms of education I use it a lot for online homework, revision tool, so if I need any additional support and I don't want to ask my teacher or it's something that she can't give me it is available whenever I need it on AI programs.""I see it as a positive because it's available whenever you need…however, I feel like some students might become too reliant upon it and it kind of takes away your own independence.""You can ask questions and you get instant feedback, instant answer… you're not really thinking for yourself.""

But fellow pupil Tito Thomson O'Reilly said he tends not to use AI for schoolwork. ""It removes a social interaction from the person.""It's just something where someone can ask a bot, a little robot a question, and all you're getting is an immediate answer, but there isn't a sense of empathy. There's not sense of teamwork, it's just a straightforward answer.""

Safeguarding concernsThere are also concerns about online safety, with an increasing number of pupils using programs that they know more about than adults.Digital safeguarding consultant Charlotte Ainsley said: ""I think it's important to recognise that we're using AI all the time already.""So anytime that you access social media or any content it's generally driven by AI and certainly some of the algorithms and some of the content that you see will be exposing children to harmful content, so if they sign up to a certain site and service and lie about their age, and we know that lots of children do, they will see content that is potentially age inappropriate for them.""I think government have a really strong role to play in regulating AI. We don't want to be back in the same place that we were in with social media"".A government spokesperson said: ""Artificial intelligence has the potential to transform education, which is why we have launched a call to evidence to learn more about both the benefits and the risks that it could bring.""More widely, we are taking quick steps to establish a regulatory framework for AI across the UK as set out through the White Paper to make sure we have the right guardrails for driving safe, responsible AI innovation.""

teachers can't tell the difference,"The majority of teachers believe students are using Artificial Intelligence apps to do their work for them, according to a new study.  A survey by education tech firm RM Technology found that two thirds of teachers believe they are regularly receiving work written by AI, with around one in ten teachers (9%) admitting they can't tell the difference between work completed by their pupil and AI programs. The survey of 500 secondary school teachers revealed that 41% believe there needs to be better regulation of AI with 31% wanting the government to step in to police its use. Mel Parker, a former headteacher who now works as a consultant for RM Technology said: ""There definitely needs to be government regulation, especially from a safeguarding point of view."" And she believes better training is needed in the use of rapidly developing tech. ""They need to know how they can talk to students about good use of AI, what is appropriate use in the classroom, how can they learn from it? How can they get better understanding of concepts - actually what is cheating and what is good practice?"" She said there is concern that pupils can use AI to cheat, especially as more than a third of teachers surveyed admit pupils know more about AI than they do. ""Teachers haven't been equipped with what they need in terms of pulling together that understanding. So they need that support so that they can spot it."" Read more: Can AI do my job?

ChatGPT from OpenAI is one of the best-known generative AI tools, though several other offerings have become widely available. These tools comb through large volumes of content to create “the best” response to the prompt.  “Generative AI is smart enough to give a plausible answer to most prompts,” says Zach Warren, who leads Technology and Innovation Content for the Thomson Reuters Institute. “From there, the human using the tool should decide whether the material is accurate and edits it. It can be a great way to get a solid first draft, even for legal issues.”  Many legal professionals are already considering the use of generative AI in their legal practice. In a recent survey, the Thomson Reuters Institute found that 82% of legal professionals believe that the capability can be used in legal work. Only 51% believed that it should be used in legal work. The difference suggests that legal professionals see the potential but are unsure if they can trust the available tools to deliver accurate legal work product.  Warren offers several ways lawyers can use generative AI to create efficiencies in their practice. For instance, you can ask the tool to write a brief or contract based on a set of facts. Once the tool generates a draft, you check the citations, terms, and narrative, editing the draft rather than starting from scratch. You can also use generative AI tools to draft an RFP response to lighten the load in business development.  Generative AI also has the potential to synthesize large amounts of data. For instance, you can upload four contracts to an AI tool and ask to see the similarities and differences. You can analyze spreadsheets full of data or get plain language answers to legal questions.   Impact of generative AI on legal practice Generative AI is poised to create incredible efficiencies and cut down on the number of hours that lawyers work. Warren says that with a trusted tool, a legal professional may be able to cut down a task such a brief writing from ten hours to even one hour. “That means the differentiating factor for lawyers won’t be time. It will be how well people manage their cases,” says Warren. Law firms will all need to leverage their efficiency gains and still bill for the value they provide. This dynamic plays out differently depending on firm size. Solo attorneys and smaller firms will find that their innovative use of generative AI enables them to take on matters they couldn’t before. Larger firms will find that their clients expect them to use generative AI, and they will need to adapt processes and pricing to properly capture value.  Let’s look at the impact of generative AI on law firms, depending on their size.  Solo attorneys use generative AI to grow Generative AI can be a powerful helper for solo attorneys looking to grow their practice. For solos billing by the hour, growth is limited by the number of hours in a day. Even those who price by the matter are limited by their own ability to get through the work in a reasonable time frame. With AI-powered legal research and know-how from a trusted source, you can cut significant time from both transactional and litigation matters. “This is pure time savings,” Warren says. “You’re not giving different advice, but maybe you can take on more clients or do more work.” You may be more available to take client calls or meet with them when you are spending less time researching and drafting. You may also be better positioned to offer flat-rate pricing, which clients may appreciate. Rather than using the extra time to take on more work, some attorneys may use generative AI to deliver the same amount of work in less time. That gives them the opportunity to spend more time with family or on their own personal growth. Either way, if you’re spending less time on tasks like research or form submissions, you have more time to spend how you want to spend it.   Small law firms innovate through generative AI Small law firms – those with up to 10 attorneys – also benefit from the time savings that their solo counterparts experience. They can take on more matters with their lean teams, and they can explore new practice areas more easily, especially with AI-powered know- how tools.  Small law firms that adopt generative AI early are likely to be seen as innovative and forward-thinking. Rather than waiting for the market to settle on uses for generative AI, early adopters can experiment based on the needs of the firm or the interests of the attorneys.  “Small law firms have so much flexibility to experiment and implement new tools,” Warren says. “If you have individual attorneys who are taking the time to learn this, you’ll find there are so many more ways to use the tools.”  Where larger firms may wait on committees or consultants to approve an AI approach, smaller firms can move quickly to take advantage of the capabilities.  Small firms may also benefit more immediately because they can get even more from their new associates. “Training and getting people out of law school is going to be interesting,” Warren says. “Documents, legal research, writing contracts are tasks that can be streamlined or automated or simplified with generative AI, and they are also tasks that most often fall to newer associates. Firms that use generative AI will be able to move new associates to more strategic work more quickly.”  This is a selling point for clients, who don’t want to pay to train new associates. It’s also a differentiator in hiring. Small law firms can compete better in the war for talent if they are able to promise less grunt work and more opportunities to work directly with partners and clients.  “Generative AI can be a huge boon to associates looking to accelerate their career,” Warren says.    Mid-size law firms use generative AI to compete on a new level Warren says that on the whole, AI can be seen as an equalizer for both small and midsize firms. “You’re competing with enterprise firms that can just throw people at a problem,” he says. Generative AI like Chat GPT, Copilot and legal-specific tools can act as a force multiplier for smaller firms that don’t have armies of new associates.  Partners are particularly aware of this dynamic. In fact, in the Thomson Reuters Institute study, “ChatGPT & Generative AI within Law Firms,” partners were the most likely to respond that generative AI should be used in legal work, outpacing the total 59% to 51%. “If you’ve made partner, you’re thinking strategically about cases and about what’s right for the firm and the business,” Warren says. “You’re aware of the efficiencies the tools bring, of the way those efficiencies could lower costs or boost growth.” For an attorney eager to make a name for themselves in the firm, helping the firm learn and implement AI could be an important career booster.  “This is the time for firms to empower people who are curious,” Warren says. “Right now, the interest in generative AI is high but adoption is low. Being the person who jumpstarts the AI initiative in your firm can be very powerful for career development.”  Aspiring AI experts can look at AI-powered document review tools, know-how, and legal research platforms as possible new tools for the firm.   Global large law firms match client needs with generative AI “Generative AI represents a shift in how global large law firms approach their business,” says Warren. That could mean that they’ll see more client pressure to go to flat-rate pricing. Or that corporate clients could decide to keep more matters in house. “Clients want big firms to use technology. They also don’t want to pay firms to handle things they can do themselves.” Warren identifies this as a particular issue for the global large law firms, versus smaller firms, because their clients tend to be the largest corporations. They have large legal teams themselves, and they are keen to manage costs as closely as possible. The Association of Corporate Counsel (ACC) recently reported nearly 60% of corporate legal departments have someone fully dedicated to tech and operations. They are automating their processes, and they expect their law firms to do the same.  “Small companies may appreciate you using generative AI,” Warren says, “But large companies will expect it.”  Global large law firms will have to navigate through the same disruptive dynamics that small and mid-size firms do, but on a greater scale. You will have to continually look at pricing models to be sure you’re capturing the value of your work product. You’ll have to look at how you onboard new associates, what work you have them cut their teeth on, and how you mentor them through the early years of their practice.   Firms may find that generative AI changes much about their businesses. Not because it replaced lawyers, but because it disrupted the status quo around the billable hour, overworked associates, tedious work, and impossible goals so completely. It can’t replace expertise, but a combination of best-in-class AI-powered technology could significantly reshape the way global large law firms and their clients do business together.  Conclusion “Generative AI will affect all lawyers, no matter which size firm you work for,” Warren says. He urges legal practitioners to start exploring the capabilities now. And to understand how different platforms verify their results. “Don’t use something you can’t trust,” he says. Those firms that lean into the capabilities can start to realize significant time savings and perhaps shift their approach to pricing, employee training, and retention to reduce costs and grow revenue. Solo attorneys can take on more matters without working more hours – or they can spend less time working while maintaining their income. Small and mid-size firms can compete with larger firms, either by taking on more matters or by expanding their practice areas. Global large law firms will use generative AI to keep up with their corporate clients and offer greater value in less time. Generative AI is only as good as its source material.

This article is from Big Technology, a newsletter by Alex Kantrowitz.
It was so over. Remember? As soon as artificial intelligence began to read, write, and code, all manner of professions were supposed to automate—fast. Lawyers were toast. Entry-level engineers, commodified. And journalists, well, it’s a small miracle we’re writing this story.
And yet, eight months after the release of ChatGPT—and several years since the advent of other A.I. business tools—the fallout’s been muted. A.I. is being widely adopted, but the imagined mass firings haven’t materialized. The United States is still effectively at full employment, with just 3.5 percent of the workforce unemployed.
The usual narrative may say otherwise, but the path toward A.I.–driven mass unemployment isn’t simple. A.I. technology, however impressive, is still not good enough to handle most jobs. Rather than eliminate our positions, companies would like us to simply be better at them. And firms hoping to replace humans with bots are learning that change management is hard.

“The demise of industries due to A.I. is just not going to be a thing,” says Sarah Guo, a venture capitalist who invests in A.I. startups.
Legal work, for instance, was supposedly squarely in A.I.’s sights, but law firms enthusiastically incorporating A.I. aren’t using it to replace lawyers. Allen & Overy, a firm that employs more than 3,000 lawyers worldwide, started working with a generative A.I. tool called Harvey last year and hasn’t replaced a single person with it.

Harvey scours legal sites, contracts, and other large documents, and then answers queries and writes summaries. It’s exactly the type of application people said would send paralegals and junior associates to the bread lines. Yet it’s helping them perform better, adding value to the firm, and not threatening their livelihood. Why get rid of more-effective employees?

Besides, although the bot is helpful, it’s not nearly good enough to handle all those employees’ tasks, and it still gets things wrong often enough to require human supervision. “This profession, it’s a service business. So you need to have reliability, you need to have accuracy,” says Daren Orzechowski, a partner at the firm. When computers digitized law books, there was a similar panic, Orzechowski says, “but here we are today, and there’s more lawyers than there were when that technology came online.”

Aaron Levie, CEO of cloud storage company Box, says generative A.I. is typically quite good at handling one duty but struggles to take on the array that humans perform at work. “They can do one discrete, information-oriented task, basically, at a time before they need a human to review what they’ve done and then move to the next thing,” he says. “Not that many jobs are relegated to only that kind of thing.” This makes A.I. great at assisting people but terrible at replacing them.

To underscore the complexity of passing work along to A.I., consider radiologists, still in high demand despite serving as a favorite example among those predicting that robots will take all the jobs. At the Mayo Clinic, for instance, approximately 500 radiologists use A.I. tools to outline and classify images of the body. The A.I. helps them get more done, to make up for shortages in medical personnel. And though it’s incredibly useful, it isn’t ready to make judgment calls on spotting rare diseases or recommending treatments.

“In some respects, it actually can increase demand for radiology, because A.I. helps us get more information out of images than we could do before,” says Dr. Bradley Erickson, a neuroradiologist who runs the Mayo Clinic’s A.I. lab. “We’re still looking to hire.”

Such complexity exists in every field, so anytime you see a company announce that it’s replacing workers with A.I., read that with some skepticism. These organizations tend to be downsizing anyway and are looking for a positive spin for investors. As one ex-IBM employee told us, it’s much easier for the PR department to announce you’re going to turn 7,800 roles over to A.I. than to actually get the A.I. to do those people’s work.

There certainly will be jobs affected by this wave of A.I., as when any new technology arrives. And it’s possible that as the technology gets better, some companies will iron out the details and automate away. At that point, there could be meaningful displacement, even if mass unemployment is unlikely. But so far, the hot takes have run into reality.
Daron Acemoglu, an economics professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says that even if the technology gets good enough to replace, say, call centers or cab drivers en masse, employers and industry will still have a choice about what to do. No outcome is predetermined, he says. In the meantime, though, it makes sense to bet on the humans. “We know from many areas that have rapidly automated that they don’t deliver the types of returns that they promised,” says Acemoglu. “Humans are underrated.”

Generative AI models are powerful tools that data scientists are using to create powerful results, from content creation to improved data analytics performance. Yet it’s becoming apparent that many users are not aware of the risks of using generative AI.
As more users incorporate generative AI into their daily workflows without doing their due diligence, the potential challenges and consequences of using these AI models are beginning to outweigh the pros. This is particularly true for enterprise users that need transparent data and security practices to protect customer data and comply with industry-specific regulations.
In this guide, we’ll briefly discuss some of the risks of using generative AI. Also important, we’ll walk through some of the best ways your organization can manage and mitigate generative AI risk.

What Are the Risks Associated With Generative AI?
Generative AI models are massive artificial intelligence tools that rely on large quantities of third-party data, neural network architecture, and complex algorithms to generate original content.
These qualities make generative models capable of human-like problem-solving tasks. But similar to a human brain, not all generative AI model decisions and outputs are easy to dissect. The AI models’ lack of transparency is one of many generative AI risks that users must consider in the context of their work.
Other important risks of generative AI include the following:

The possibility that an AI model has used copyrighted data or creations without a creator’s consent; even when users are unaware of this violation, if they make commercial use of unauthorized content, they could be held liable.
The possibility of using sensitive consumer data and that data becoming part of the model’s ongoing training dataset.
A model’s training data could be biased, incomplete, or otherwise inaccurate.
Models may not have as many built-in safeguards as your organization needs to protect data and comply with regulations.
There’s always the chance an employee could unknowingly misuse a model or sensitive data, exposing intellectual property and other sensitive company information.
Generative models occasionally hallucinate, which means they confidently generate content that is inaccurate.
Models frequently store data for an extended period of time, which increases datasets’ chances of being exposed to a cyberattack.
Many models have little to no cybersecurity tooling in place natively; additionally, generative AI models can be tricked into solving security puzzles for malicious actors.
Generative models’ lack of transparency makes it difficult to quality-test and audit model data and usage.
Generative AI models are subject to few regulations, though several countries have AI legislation in the works; in general, generative AI vendors are not being held to the same consumer-protection standards as many other businesses.

Generative AI Risk Management: 6 Best Practices
1) Create and Enforce an AI Use Policy in Your Organization
Whether you’re already using generative AI across your organization or are simply considering its benefits, it’s a good idea to establish an acceptable use AI policy for your organization. This policy should explain:

Which departments and roles are allowed to use generative models as part of their work.
What parts of the workflow can be automated or supplemented with generative AI.
What internal data and apps are and are not allowed to be exposed to these models.

Establishing these policies gives your employees a better framework for what they can and cannot do with generative AI and also gives your leadership a clearer understanding of what behaviors they should be monitoring and correcting. If you’re looking for an existing policy to model your own policy after, NIST’s Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework is a great option.

2) Use First-Party Data and Responsibly Source Third-Party Data
When using a generative model in an enterprise setting, you should always know where your input data is coming from. Whenever possible, use first-party data that your company owns; this will help you keep track of your data’s origins and determine if that data is safe to use in a generative model. If it becomes necessary for you to use data that your company does not own, make sure you are using credible third-party sources with permission. This will increase the likelihood of you using high-quality data and steering clear of lawsuits for unauthorized data use.
Beyond the data your organization chooses to input in existing models, it’s also beneficial to research how generative AI vendors are sourcing their training data. Companies that refuse to explain any of these processes in their documentation should raise alarms for your organization and be avoided.
Even if your organization unknowingly uses or benefits from data that was illegally sourced by the vendor, you may still be held responsible for any outputs that violate copyright laws or privacy rights.
3) Train Employees on Appropriate Data and Generative Model Usage
It’s a clear risk to have an AI use policy does not guarantee that all users will know and follow the policy’s specific rules.
That’s why it’s important to train employees with the policy as a foundation and then explain how that policy applies to specific roles, departments, and scenarios. This will help your organization to maintain optimal levels of security and compliance by avoiding individual user errors that are more difficult to detect. All employees should receive this training, but employees who work with your most sensitive data and applications should receive more detailed and frequent training.
For better AI use outcomes, training should extend beyond your policy and cover tips for how to detect AI bias, misinformation, and hallucinations. This will give your employees the confidence they need to use models well and make more calculated decisions for tasks like AI-driven data analytics.

4) Invest in Cybersecurity Tools That Address AI Security Risks
Generative AI models and artificial intelligence tools in general require strong cybersecurity protections to secure all of the information they contain. Unfortunately, many generative AI models do not have much native cybersecurity infrastructure in place, or these features are so difficult to configure that most users do not set them up.
To protect input and output data against cybersecurity threats, you should consider any generative AI models you use as part of your network’s attack surface and set up your network security tools accordingly. If you’re not already using cybersecurity tools to protect your enterprise network, we recommend investing in tools like the following ones that are designed with AI and other modern attack surfaces in mind:

Identity and access management.
Data encryption and data security tools.
Cloud security posture management (CSPM).
Penetration testing.
Extended detection and response (XDR).
Threat intelligence.
Data loss prevention (DLP).

5) Build a Team of AI Quality Assurance Analysts
If you’re planning to use AI models on a larger scale, it’s worth hiring or training existing employees to work as AI quality assurance analysts or engineers. These individuals are responsible for maintaining and monitoring both the AI models your organization uses and the data that goes into these models.
Some of the most important responsibilities of an AI quality assurance analyst are:

Detecting issues in both training data and input data.
QA testing outputs to ensure generated content is accurate, original, and appropriately attributed.
Monitoring generative models, APIs, and other relevant infrastructure for unusual behaviors.
Maintaining regular documentation of model behavioral anomalies and data inaccuracies to support future audits.
Working closely with cybersecurity and data science teams to use generative AI tools effectively.

6) Research Generative AI Models Before Using Them
While generative AI vendors are not currently required by law to offer transparent documentation or information about their models’ training, a number of them have expanded their documentation by customer request.
As an example, OpenAI provides a publicly available research index with regularly released papers on individual products and the steps the company is taking to make large language models safer and more efficient. The company also has several legal terms and policies, including usage policies and API data usage policies.
Generative AI customers should read this type of research not only to better understand the full range of capabilities these tools possess but also to determine if data has been sourced and models have been trained in ways that align with company values and industry regulations.
It’s also prudent to keep up with news and lawsuits related to AI companies, as this information could impact what products you choose to use moving forward.

Bottom Line: Mitigating Generative AI Risks
Generative AI models offer a number of automations, shortcuts, and easy answers to enterprise users, making them great tools for growth and innovation. In fact, these models are so advanced and scalable that they’re being used for complex tasks ranging from drug discovery to smart manufacturing.
But using generative AI models comes with serious risks if you’re unwilling to research and bolster these solutions with the right cybersecurity tools, policies, and best practices. These models are changing and expanding their capabilities on an almost-daily basis. So it’s important to stay up-to-date on their potential use cases, how they are being regulated, and what you can do to make sure internal use aligns with both larger regulations and your organization’s own policies and best practices.

‘This Is an Existential Threat’: Will AI Really Eliminate Actors and Ruin Hollywood? Insiders Sound Off








						By 

	
Todd Spangler 



























































































































	Filmmaker Justine Bateman doesn’t think there is a thriving future for actors in filmed entertainment as we know it. She believes that artificial intelligence will ultimately suck the creative marrow out of Hollywood.

	“AI can create a convincing simulation of a hu­­man actor, and the tech is improving at an alarming rate,” says Bateman, the former “Family Ties” star who has a degree in computer science and digital media management from UCLA. In a few short years, she asks, why would anyone need to pay real actors?

	“I stress that this is an existential threat,” continues Bateman, who is an adviser to SAG-AFTRA on AI issues. “And if they can do this with actors, they can do it with writers, directors, cinematographers — everyone. We’ll be replaced with Frankenstein spoonfuls of our own work.”

	When it comes to Hollywood, the sudden rise of AI-enabled content-creation platforms has only widened the already enormous divide between entertainment unions and the industry’s largest employers. Generative AI — advanced computing platforms that can create new text and imagery based on reams of existing reference material — has become a veritable villain in the current labor standoff. Signs on the unions’ picket lines this summer have been emblazoned with anti-AI slogans like “AI is not ART,” “Wrote ChatGPT This” and “AI’s not taking your dumb notes.”

	“Everyone understands that AI is a tidal wave that is coming for us one way or the other,” says Sarah Moses, entertainment litigation partner at law firm Manatt, Phelps & Phillips. “But it’s hard to negotiate right now because there are so many unknowns.”

	Let’s start with this one: Is the hand-wringing over generative AI overblown?

VIP+ Survey: Industry Sentiments on Gen AI Use

	There’s a general consensus that AI can’t produce original TV shows and movies that are anything close to what audiences expect — and that it may never be a satisfying substitute for the real human deal.

	“It’s fun to imagine a generative AI scriptwriter, but there is absolutely no interest in that. Because it’s lousy,” says Monica Landers, founder and CEO of StoryFit, an Austin-based company that uses AI to analyze screenplays. “It can’t hold on to the pacing to reveal the plot. It’s not made for character growth. It’s so empty right now.”

	









	James Cameron, the filmmaker behind AI thriller “The Terminator” and blockbusters like “Avatar” and “Titanic,” has no plans to use artificial intelligence to write a script. “I just don’t believe that a disembodied mind that’s just regurgitating what other embodied minds have said will ever have something that’s going to move an audience,” Cameron recently told CTV News. He added, “Let’s wait 20 years, and if an AI wins an Oscar for best screenplay, I think we’ve got to take them seriously.”


	Generative AI is transforming everything about computing, and it represents an advance on par with the introduction of the PC or the smartphone. In the right hands, it will yield a class of powerful new creative tools.

	“We should look at AI as ‘augmented intelligence,’ rather than ‘artificial intelligence,’” says Sunny Dhillon, managing partner at venture-capital firm Kyber Knight Capital. “This will let filmmakers work faster and cheaper and make movies that are more compelling.”

	The reason that AI is changing the way the world works is that now anyone can harness the power of generative AI tools simply by using plain-language instructions, says Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, the chipmaker that has emerged as a powerhouse in the AI space. All of a sudden, you don’t need specialized training in, say, coding to create something incredible.

	“We’ve democratized computer science,” Huang told a rapturous crowd at the Siggraph 2023 computer-graphics confab in L.A. last week. “Generative AI is the new killer app.”

	The suits in Hollywood are clearly intrigued by AI, as are executives in every industry. About 96% of AI decision-makers at media and entertain­ment companies said they plan to increase their spending on generative AI technology in the next 12 months, according to a survey of 6,000 employees by enterprise search-engine vendor Lucidworks conducted between May and July. They add that they’re not looking to use it to eliminate workers; just 4% of those surveyed said they ex­­pect AI adoption to result in “job displacement.”

VIP+ Analysis: Four Ways Hollywood Should Use AI

	Disney CEO Bob Iger says the company is starting to use AI to operate more efficiently. “Overall, I’m bullish about the prospects because I think they’ll create efficiencies and ways for us to basically provide better services to customers,” he told Wall Street analysts in May.

	At Amazon, every one of the tech giant’s teams — including in its entertainment business — has multiple generative AI technology projects in the works, according to CEO Andy Jassy, speaking on Amazon’s Aug. 3 earnings call. He was light on specifics but said generative AI “is going to be at the heart of what we do” as Amazon looks to use it to reduce costs and “reinvent” cus-tomer experiences.

	A recent Netflix job listing for a product manager in the company’s machine-learning group listed a salary range of between $300,000 and $900,000. That triggered ire among the Hollywood unions’ rank and file. “Talk about tone-deafness, FFS!” tweeted WGA member Christopher Derrick, whose writing credits include “Star Trek: Picard” and “The Equalizer.” Never mind that the Netflix job in question centers on AI developments for content personalization and optimizing payment-processing systems. With the unions coalesced around fighting the encroachment of all things AI, Netflix’s listing is now a boogeyman.

	










	Forms of artificial intelligence, of course, have existed for decades (think spell-check programs or digital thermostats). What’s new — and, to Bateman and others, extremely alarming — is how rapidly gen AI has advanced to be able to create snippets of film or television that, if you squint, can look like actual humans in scenes produced by human directors. An AI-generated script can read like something written by a professional writer. A tipping point came in November 2022 when software firm OpenAI released ChatGPT, a chatbot that can spit out fully formed essays on a range of different topics. 

	“For years, everyone has known AI was coming,” says Jason Vredenburg, an associate professor at Stevens Institute of Technology who teaches American film history. “But when ChatGPT came out, everyone was shocked. They realized it was coming faster than anyone thought.”

	That’s why in the current entertainment industry labor disputes, AI has become a flashpoint. The WGA wants its members to be able to use AI tools but is asking for assurances that using those tools won’t count against them in determining credit and pay. The AMPTP has offered to spell out explicitly that a “writer” must be a human, but also says further discussion is needed in the area.

	Meanwhile, SAG-AFTRA has alleged that studios “want to scan a background performer’s image, pay them for a half a day’s labor and then use an individual’s likeness for any purpose forever without their consent.” The AMPTP has emphatically denied this.

	But background actors have become deeply worried about their employment prospects in an AI world. “We don’t know what all our scans are being used for,” says Prince Royal, an actor who says that when he worked as an extra on “The Flash” he was required to submit to a 360-degree image scan — or go home without pay. AMPTP says under its proposal, producers must obtain background actors’ full consent and separately bargain for payment for each use of a digital replica.

	Per the AMPTP, what is needed is “a balanced approach based on careful use, not prohibition.”

	Multiple legal issues with generative AI have yet to be fully ironed out. One gray area — the subject of several lawsuits — has to do with the source material used to “train” generative AI models.

	Last month, a lawsuit on behalf of Sarah Silverman and other authors accused Meta and OpenAI of illegally using copyrighted works — including Silverman’s 2010 bestselling memoir “The Bedwetter: Stories of Courage, Redemption, and Pee” — to train their AI systems. (Meta declined to comment. Silverman also declined to comment, citing the pending litigation. OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment.)

VIP+ Analysis: AI Copyright Cases Under Cloud of Uncertainty










	Some experts say there’s nothing in the law that prevents AI systems from using any kind of source material for training. U.S. laws stipulate that you can’t copy a specific copyrighted work or performance, says Yale Law School professor Robert Post. But actors, he says, study all kinds of performances to inform their own. “Everyone has a right to study them,” including someone who is using AI to do so, says Post. He adds, “It’s not copyright infringement to read a lot of books.”

	Other commentators have argued that the U.S. needs a federal law protecting name, image and likeness that supersedes today’s state-by-state regulations.

	Hilary Krane, chief legal officer at CAA, believes generative AI issues pertaining to intellectual property, as well as name, image and likeness rights, are solvable and addressable concerns. “We want to make sure the rules of the road are clear,” she says. “Uncertainty always breeds fear.”

	The music industry has been the canary in the coal mine for many technologies, including piracy, and has been among the first in the entertainment field to have to grapple with generative AI that mimics specific artists’ styles and voices. Earlier this year, Universal Music Group filed copyright-infringement claims to remove an AI-generated song called “Heart on My Sleeve” that sounded very much like a collab between Drake and the Weeknd, neither of whom was involved with the song.

	What the industry might need is some kind of truth-in-labeling regulations for generative AI, similar to the way the FDA requires standardized food labeling, says Michael Huppe, CEO of SoundExchange, a nonprofit rights management organization for digital sound recordings. “Maybe you’ll end up paying more for a ‘human-only’ streaming service,” he says.


	To date, generative AI has made the biggest inroads in VFX for tasks like de-aging actors and dubbing scenes into other languages. But given the antagonism from some on the picket lines toward all things AI, it’s a weird time to be selling AI-enabled products to Hollywood.

	StoryFit, for example, works with studios and networks to break down a script and identify whether elements and characters in a story resonate with audiences. Monica Landers compares it to an audience preview but using an AI-modeled audience to react to a project when it’s at the script stage.

	“We don’t want to be the bad guy,” says Landers. “But we do find ourselves in the middle of it. I often find myself responding defensively: ‘We are not generative AI; we are using AI to help creativity.’”

	Some years ago, professional language translators were very worried about AI eliminating their jobs when tools like Google Translate became more proficient. What actually happened, according to Landers, was that the AI tools took on a lot of the “boring scutwork” of translators, but they have not been able to replicate mood or convey idioms in the way human translators can. In the context of the Hollywood strikes, Landers says, “My hope is we can figure out a way that writers and actors are protected enough so that they can be part of creating in whatever this new world is going to be.”

	Scott Mann, co-CEO of Flawless, which specializes in gen-AI filmmaking tools, and a director and producer whose films include “Fall” and “Heist,” says the recent uproar over AI in creative industries has highlighted “the responsibility factor” — that is, producers must obtain permission from actors and compensate them for anything based on their likeness.

	“The truth is, there are huge misunderstandings around gen AI,” says Mann. “I don’t see any point in time where you take humans out of the equation. Fundamentally, films are created from human feelings and emotions.”

	









	On AI issues, the path of least resistance for the unions and the AMPTP may be to agree to certain “broad strokes” and to table the more nitty-gritty points of contention until the next round of negotiations, says Moses. “The parties might be best served kicking the can down the road.”


	But that road may be coming up fast. Joe Russo, co-director of Marvel movies including “Avengers: Endgame” and “Avengers: Infinity War,” has predicted that generative AI may be able to create feature-length movies within two years — and that the technology could put you, the viewer, into an AI-generated movie.

	“At some point, perhaps, you could tell a video-streaming service, ‘Hey, I want a movie starring my photoreal avatar and Marilyn Monroe’s photo-real avatar,’” Russo said in an April interview with Collider. “It renders a very competent story with dialogue that mimics your voice. … And suddenly now you have a rom-com starring you that’s 90 minutes long. So you can curate your story specifically to you.”

	Echoing Russo’s thought experiment, Bateman predicts that rights holders will sooner or later let consumers insert themselves into classic movies — imagine yourself starring in “Citizen Kane.” Or maybe AI generates some kind of derivative work cobbled together from an AI database trained on existing stories and characters trending in your feeds. Either way, in Bateman’s doomsday outlook, the market for human-created entertainment will wither away, replaced by synthetic fare produced at a fraction of the cost.

	“There’s no scenario I can think of where this doesn’t happen,” Bateman says. “Generative AI can’t make great films. But it can create a high volume of content and regurgitate sequels.”

	But others say that instead of fighting the future, the more productive strategy is to figure out where AI technology is most useful, while working to ensure copyright protections for individual creators as well as name, image and likeness rights for performers.

	The real question the industry faces is how people can get past their fear about AI and start to unlock its potential, says CJ Bangah, who leads PwC’s entertainment and media practice.

	“Some of the most impactful artisans in the future will find ways to use AI in ways we are just beginning to understand,” Bangah says, adding, “‘Hand-crafted’ doesn’t mean not using technology.”

A tidal wave is about to crash into the global economy. The rise of artificial intelligence has captured our imagination for decades, in whimsical movies and sober academic texts. Despite this speculation, the emergence of public, easy-to-use AI tools over the past year has been a jolt, like the future arrived years ahead of schedule. Now this long-expected, all-too-sudden technological revolution is ready to upend the economy.

A March Goldman Sachs report found over 300 million jobs around the world could be disrupted by AI, and the global consulting firm McKinsey estimated at least 12 million Americans would change to another field of work by 2030. A ""gale of creative destruction,"" as economist Joseph Schumpeter once described it, will blow away countless firms and breathe life into new industries. It won't be all bleak: Over the coming decades, nongenerative and generative AI are estimated to add between $17 trillion and $26 trillion to the global economy. And crucially, many of the jobs that will be lost will be replaced by new ones.

The crescendo for this technological wave is surging, and we are at just the beginning of this upheaval that will ripple through the labor market and global economy. It's likely to be a transformation as influential as the industrial revolution and the rise of the internet. The changes could boost living standards, improve productivity, and accelerate economic opportunities, but this rosy future is not guaranteed. Unless governments, CEOs, and workers properly prepare for the upsurge with urgency, the AI revolution could be painful.We didn't see the internet coming, but AI is within viewThe adoption of groundbreaking technology is often hard to predict. Take the internet: In 1995, Newsweek published an article titled, ""Why the Web Won't Be Nirvana,"" making the case that books and airline tickets would never be purchased over the internet. Later that year, Bill Gates was asked by an unconvinced David Letterman, ""What about this internet thing?"" Even three years later, as adoption grew, the economist Paul Krugman famously declared that the internet's influence would be no greater than that of the fax machine. In hindsight, it's clear that the internet's effects couldn't have been any more miscalculated.Part of the reason for the initial skepticism was that the influence of the internet was uneven and slow at first but quickly grew as more people learned how it worked. ""The rule for exponential curves is that they changed the world slowly at first, and then suddenly,"" Erik Brynjolfsson, a Stanford University innovation economist, told me. The arrival of AI presents similar unknowns — but the growth curve is becoming clear much quicker. In 2017, McKinsey estimated that robust large language models such as GPT-4 would be developed by 2027. But they are already here. And seemingly overnight, OpenAI's generative AI was integrated into Microsoft products, and in the span of a few months, corporate giants including Amazon, AT&T, Salesforce, and Cisco have rushed to incorporate enterprise-grade AI tools. McKinsey's latest report predicted that somewhere between 2030 and 2060, half of today's work tasks would be automated. Their best guess as to when this will happen — 2045 — is almost a decade earlier than previously estimated. Things are changing fast.And as adoption picks up, so will the downstream effects of the technology. The World Economic Forum estimated 83 million jobs worldwide would be lost over the next five years because of AI, with 69 million jobs created — that leaves 14 million jobs that will cease to exist during that timeframe. Even the people who do retain their jobs will experience a massive shift in how they do their work: The World Economic Forum says that 44% of workers' core skills are expected to change in the next five years.

I do not think we'll see mass unemployment. But I do think we'll see mass disruption. Stanford economist Erik BrynjolfssonPast automation technologies had the most effect on low-skilled workers. But with generative AI, the more educated and highly skilled workers who previously were immune to automation are vulnerable. According to the International Labor Organization, there are between 644 and 997 million knowledge workers globally, between 20% and 30% of total global employment. In the US, the knowledge-worker class is estimated to be nearly 100 million workers, one out of three Americans. A broad spectrum of occupations — marketing and sales, software engineering, research and development, accounting, financial advising, and writing, to name a few — is at risk of being automated away or evolving.This doesn't mean, however, that there will be a flood of unemployed workers begging for any job. AI will lead to net job creation over the long run, and some roles that seem like they will be affected may actually grow in demand. For instance, ATMs increased the number of bank tellers. ""I do not think we'll see mass unemployment,"" Brynjolfsson, who anticipates AI spreading faster than other general-purpose technologies, told me. ""But I do think we'll see mass disruption, where a lot of wages for some jobs will fall, wages for other jobs will rise, and we'll be shifting around into demand for different kinds of skills. They'll have to be a lot of reallocation of labor and rescaling of labor with winners and losers.""This shift will be so massive that we won't miss many of the jobs that disappear. Before the industrial revolution, the job of a human alarm clock was to wake up workers in the early-morning hours by tapping a broomstick on their window. Thanks to alarm clocks, no one misses this job today. Similarly with AI, there will be jobs that will be conveniently forgotten about.

Permanent mass unemployment can safely be ruled out, but in the short term, the transition will be messy. If one-quarter of tasks across all US occupations were automated by AI, and one-third of workers' workload replaced, it would take only a small segment of the broad white-collar class to simultaneously experience job losses or transitions for it to have a dire impact on the broader economy. This sort of monumental reshuffling requires preparation on the part of governments and businesses. In its most recent employment outlook, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development declared that this AI revolution was creating ""an urgent need to act now"" to help the economy adapt.Productivity boom In 1987, the economist Robert Solow famously declared: ""You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics."" Solow's ""productivity paradox"" spotlighted a key puzzle of the emerging computer age. Even with heavy investments in information technology and computing — which were supposedly making workers more productive — official statistics showed that workers were not producing more per hour.


                                Related stories
                              


Robert Gordon, a macroeconomist and self-styled ""prophet of pessimism,"" provocatively suggested that the ho-hum productivity figures proved that new technology today was less radical than in the past and that as a result, the world's advanced economies had entered a point of stagnation. The most impactful technologies — the car, the toilet — have already been invented, he argued, and everything else only incrementally improves productivity. Along the same lines, other economists have suggested that the growth rate of new ideas is slowing.These arguments may seem like a compelling reason to doubt the productivity gains of AI at first, but there's good reason to think that the latest revolution could produce more rapid gains. The internet's mass adoption required software, network protocols, infrastructure, and devices — it took awhile for every home and office to have computers and internet access.

Today, AI's adoption could happen much faster since the technological infrastructure is already in place. Plus, in contrast to hype cycles around crypto or the metaverse, AI is entering maturity. Its user experience makes it uncomplicated, and it already has practical uses, which is why hundreds of millions of people are already integrating the tech into their day-to-day workflows. This is starting to push the technology into companies. It's also not AI on its own that's game-changing; layering AI on top of preexisting tech can unlock exponential gains — just as the combination of the internet, GPS technology, and smartphones changed our world. Laser weeders that use AI, GPS, and tractor technology can now comb through crop fields in seconds to zap weeds, eliminating the need for herbicides or large hand-weeding crews. And AI embedded within advanced imaging tools have the potential to diagnose and treat cancer. If the internet made the world flat, then AI makes the world faster. One recent study conducted by Brynjolfsson and his colleagues quantified the productivity of over 5,000 customer-service agents who used generative-AI technology. The results were encouraging: Call-center operators became 14% more productive, and less experienced workers improved their productivity as much as 30%. A study out of MIT found software developers completed tasks 56% faster with generative-code-completion software, and yet another study found that professional-document writing was 40% faster using generative AI. The small and large compounding effects of productivity growth across many industries are central to the growth trajectory and the long-run effects of AI. Goldman Sachs estimated that over 10 years, generative AI alone could raise annual US labor-productivity growth by just under 1.5 percentage points, ""roughly the same-sized boost that followed the emergence of prior transformative technologies like the electric motor and personal computer."" If that proved true, it would lead to an annual increase of 7% in global GDP, while contributing $2.6 trillion to 4.4 trillion to the global economy — about the equivalent of the UK economy.

Brynjolfsson, a ""mindful optimist,"" is confident that these productivity gains will accumulate — and show up in the official stats. He told me that he had a bet with Gordon, the pessimist, that productivity growth over the coming years would outpace the 1.4% annual growth projected by the Congressional Budget Office. ""In fact, I think it's going to be closer to double that,"" he said.While estimates for productivity reflect how workers within firms will become more efficient at their jobs, it also assumes that laid-off workers will find new jobs. As productivity rises, total economic output will increase and GDP will rise. This will create a virtuous cycle, as companies will need to expand operations to keep up with this increased demand, which means they will need more workers. Plus, labor-productivity growth has been shown to raise real incomes, benefiting workers and households. Simply put: Technological innovation, even as it may lead to worker displacement, will help workers in the long run. A widely cited study by the economist David Autor and colleagues found 60% of workers today had jobs that did not exist 80 years ago, suggesting that 85% growth in employment was a result of technology innovation. Future proofing — faster and smarter That's all great news, but the turbulence of the AI revolution can't be ignored. The rapid pace of AI advancement and adoption makes this shift markedly different from past industrial revolutions. It's not as simple as textile workers being replaced by mechanized looms — workforce transformations are happening to varying degrees across occupations. And this pace of change is bound to outrun any changes in education and workforce preparation designed to keep up with the tech.America's already antiquated workforce education system already fails to address modern workers' needs, let alone what they may need as AI takes hold. Maria Flynn, the CEO of the Washington think tank Jobs for the Future, said the US was encumbered by a ""patchwork of programs that don't blend into a nice-looking quilt."" In fact, there are 43 federal employment-training programs whose total budget is $20 billion, or less than 0.1% of US GDP. This is an alarmingly trivial amount for an economy of $25 trillion GDP and over 150 million workers.

 To ease the pain of the labor-market upheaval, the US needs to invest more in its workforce — and fast. One approach is to adopt Denmark's model of job security and retraining, known as ""flexicurity."" The system helps avoid structural unemployment by making it easy for employers to let go of workers and by providing a substantial cushion for those laid off. The program provides unemployment benefits for two years at as much as $2,860 a month for people who are laid off, as well as one-on-one job counseling with retraining opportunities. As a result, the Danes are unemployed for much less time compared with workers in similar countries.

The US once had a similar program, the Trade Adjustment Assistance program, which was established in 1974 and administered by the Department of Labor for workers affected by trade and production in other countries. ""It was an entitlement program so that any worker who met certain conditions — that their job was displaced due to trade — had an entitlement to receive a package of income support and retraining support,"" Flynn told me. An expansive and well-funded program geared toward the AI labor-market shift would help ease turbulence for workers by providing relocation grants and wage insurance to temporarily bridge the wage gap when workers find employment in lower-paying jobs.To retrain people for an AI-based economy, the US could look to Singapore. There, workers above the age of 25 are given $500 in credits to access 24,000 courses in anything from data science to business, and a public-private retraining program makes sure skills training is matched to employers' job classifications. Every year, over 660,000 people make use of the country's national retraining program. For those concerned about productivity lags, these kinds of large-scale upgrades to education and training have the potential to fill in the gaps of a major workforce transition. Singapore's efforts have helped step up the annual labor-productivity growth rate to a respectable 3%. All these public-sector policies would still need to be complemented by private-sector investment in retraining. In an MIT survey of workers, 50% of respondents reported receiving formal skills training by their employers. Incentivizing retraining through tax credits –– such as those in New York and Georgia –– could spur employers into action and ensure everyone is ready for the AI revolution.

Technology can't be uninvented — disruptive catalysts such as AI require the proactive pursuit of adapting to that change. And making workers resilient to large shocks requires recognizing that this technological wave can temporarily wipe out a large portion of the workforce, or it can be smoothly surfed to calm waters.Emil Skandul is a writer on technology and urban economics, and a Tony Blair Institute fellow.

Despite this speculation, the emergence of public, easy-to-use AI tools over the past year has been a jolt, like the future arrived years ahead of schedule. Now this long-expected, all-too-sudden technological revolution is ready to upend the economy. A March Goldman Sachs report found over 300 million jobs around the world could be disrupted by AI, and the global consulting firm McKinsey estimated at least 12 million Americans would change to another field of work by 2030. A ""gale of creative destruction,"" as economist Joseph Schumpeter once described it, will blow away countless firms and breathe life into new industries. It won't be all bleak: Over the coming decades, nongenerative and generative AI are estimated to add between $17 trillion and $26 trillion to the global economy. And crucially, many of the jobs that will be lost will be replaced by new ones.The crescendo for this technological wave is surging, and we are at just the beginning of this upheaval that will ripple through the labor market and global economy. It's likely to be a transformation as influential as the industrial revolution and the rise of the internet. The changes could boost living standards, improve productivity, and accelerate economic opportunities, but this rosy future is not guaranteed. Unless governments, CEOs, and workers properly prepare for the upsurge with urgency, the AI revolution could be painful.The adoption of groundbreaking technology is often hard to predict. Take the internet: In 1995, Newsweek published an article titled, ""Why the Web Won't Be Nirvana,"" making the case that books and airline tickets would never be purchased over the internet. Later that year, Bill Gates was asked by an unconvinced David Letterman, ""What about this internet thing?"" Even three years later, as adoption grew, the economist Paul Krugman famously declared that the internet's influence would be no greater than that of the fax machine. In hindsight, it's clear that the internet's effects couldn't have been any more miscalculated.Part of the reason for the initial skepticism was that the influence of the internet was uneven and slow at first but quickly grew as more people learned how it worked. ""The rule for exponential curves is that they changed the world slowly at first, and then suddenly,"" Erik Brynjolfsson, a Stanford University innovation economist, told me. The arrival of AI presents similar unknowns — but the growth curve is becoming clear much quicker. In 2017, McKinsey estimated that robust large language models such as GPT-4 would be developed by 2027. But they are already here. And seemingly overnight, OpenAI's generative AI was integrated into Microsoft products, and in the span of a few months, corporate giants including Amazon, AT&T, Salesforce, and Cisco have rushed to incorporate enterprise-grade AI tools. McKinsey's latest report predicted that somewhere between 2030 and 2060, half of today's work tasks would be automated. Their best guess as to when this will happen — 2045 — is almost a decade earlier than previously estimated. Things are changing fast.And as adoption picks up, so will the downstream effects of the technology. The World Economic Forum estimated 83 million jobs worldwide would be lost over the next five years because of AI, with 69 million jobs created — that leaves 14 million jobs that will cease to exist during that timeframe. Even the people who do retain their jobs will experience a massive shift in how they do their work: The World Economic Forum says that 44% of workers' core skills are expected to change in the next five years.Past automation technologies had the most effect on low-skilled workers. But with generative AI, the more educated and highly skilled workers who previously were immune to automation are vulnerable. According to the International Labor Organization, there are between 644 and 997 million knowledge workers globally, between 20% and 30% of total global employment. In the US, the knowledge-worker class is estimated to be nearly 100 million workers, one out of three Americans. A broad spectrum of occupations — marketing and sales, software engineering, research and development, accounting, financial advising, and writing, to name a few — is at risk of being automated away or evolving.This doesn't mean, however, that there will be a flood of unemployed workers begging for any job. AI will lead to net job creation over the long run, and some roles that seem like they will be affected may actually grow in demand. For instance, ATMs increased the number of bank tellers. ""I do not think we'll see mass unemployment,"" Brynjolfsson, who anticipates AI spreading faster than other general-purpose technologies, told me. ""But I do think we'll see mass disruption, where a lot of wages for some jobs will fall, wages for other jobs will rise, and we'll be shifting around into demand for different kinds of skills. They'll have to be a lot of reallocation of labor and rescaling of labor with winners and losers.""This shift will be so massive that we won't miss many of the jobs that disappear. Before the industrial revolution, the job of a human alarm clock was to wake up workers in the early-morning hours by tapping a broomstick on their window. Thanks to alarm clocks, no one misses this job today. Similarly with AI, there will be jobs that will be conveniently forgotten about.Permanent mass unemployment can safely be ruled out, but in the short term, the transition will be messy. If one-quarter of tasks across all US occupations were automated by AI, and one-third of workers' workload replaced, it would take only a small segment of the broad white-collar class to simultaneously experience job losses or transitions for it to have a dire impact on the broader economy. This sort of monumental reshuffling requires preparation on the part of governments and businesses. In its most recent employment outlook, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development declared that this AI revolution was creating ""an urgent need to act now"" to help the economy adapt.In 1987, the economist Robert Solow famously declared: ""You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics."" Solow's ""productivity paradox"" spotlighted a key puzzle of the emerging computer age. Even with heavy investments in information technology and computing — which were supposedly making workers more productive — official statistics showed that workers were not producing more per hour.Robert Gordon, a macroeconomist and self-styled ""prophet of pessimism,"" provocatively suggested that the ho-hum productivity figures proved that new technology today was less radical than in the past and that as a result, the world's advanced economies had entered a point of stagnation. The most impactful technologies — the car, the toilet — have already been invented, he argued, and everything else only incrementally improves productivity. Along the same lines, other economists have suggested that the growth rate of new ideas is slowing.These arguments may seem like a compelling reason to doubt the productivity gains of AI at first, but there's good reason to think that the latest revolution could produce more rapid gains. The internet's mass adoption required software, network protocols, infrastructure, and devices — it took awhile for every home and office to have computers and internet access. Today, AI's adoption could happen much faster since the technological infrastructure is already in place. Plus, in contrast to hype cycles around crypto or the metaverse, AI is entering maturity. Its user experience makes it uncomplicated, and it already has practical uses, which is why hundreds of millions of people are already integrating the tech into their day-to-day workflows. This is starting to push the technology into companies. It's also not AI on its own that's game-changing; layering AI on top of preexisting tech can unlock exponential gains — just as the combination of the internet, GPS technology, and smartphones changed our world. Laser weeders that use AI, GPS, and tractor technology can now comb through crop fields in seconds to zap weeds, eliminating the need for herbicides or large hand-weeding crews. And AI embedded within advanced imaging tools have the potential to diagnose and treat cancer. If the internet made the world flat, then AI makes the world faster. One recent study conducted by Brynjolfsson and his colleagues quantified the productivity of over 5,000 customer-service agents who used generative-AI technology. The results were encouraging: Call-center operators became 14% more productive, and less experienced workers improved their productivity as much as 30%. A study out of MIT found software developers completed tasks 56% faster with generative-code-completion software, and yet another study found that professional-document writing was 40% faster using generative AI. The small and large compounding effects of productivity growth across many industries are central to the growth trajectory and the long-run effects of AI. Goldman Sachs estimated that over 10 years, generative AI alone could raise annual US labor-productivity growth by just under 1.5 percentage points, ""roughly the same-sized boost that followed the emergence of prior transformative technologies like the electric motor and personal computer."" If that proved true, it would lead to an annual increase of 7% in global GDP, while contributing $2.6 trillion to 4.4 trillion to the global economy — about the equivalent of the UK economy. Brynjolfsson, a ""mindful optimist,"" is confident that these productivity gains will accumulate — and show up in the official stats. He told me that he had a bet with Gordon, the pessimist, that productivity growth over the coming years would outpace the 1.4% annual growth projected by the Congressional Budget Office. ""In fact, I think it's going to be closer to double that,"" he said.While estimates for productivity reflect how workers within firms will become more efficient at their jobs, it also assumes that laid-off workers will find new jobs. As productivity rises, total economic output will increase and GDP will rise. This will create a virtuous cycle, as companies will need to expand operations to keep up with this increased demand, which means they will need more workers. Plus, labor-productivity growth has been shown to raise real incomes, benefiting workers and households. Simply put: Technological innovation, even as it may lead to worker displacement, will help workers in the long run. A widely cited study by the economist David Autor and colleagues found 60% of workers today had jobs that did not exist 80 years ago, suggesting that 85% growth in employment was a result of technology innovation. That's all great news, but the turbulence of the AI revolution can't be ignored. The rapid pace of AI advancement and adoption makes this shift markedly different from past industrial revolutions. It's not as simple as textile workers being replaced by mechanized looms — workforce transformations are happening to varying degrees across occupations. And this pace of change is bound to outrun any changes in education and workforce preparation designed to keep up with the tech.America's already antiquated workforce education system already fails to address modern workers' needs, let alone what they may need as AI takes hold. Maria Flynn, the CEO of the Washington think tank Jobs for the Future, said the US was encumbered by a ""patchwork of programs that don't blend into a nice-looking quilt."" In fact, there are 43 federal employment-training programs whose total budget is $20 billion, or less than 0.1% of US GDP. This is an alarmingly trivial amount for an economy of $25 trillion GDP and over 150 million workers. To ease the pain of the labor-market upheaval, the US needs to invest more in its workforce — and fast. One approach is to adopt Denmark's model of job security and retraining, known as ""flexicurity."" The system helps avoid structural unemployment by making it easy for employers to let go of workers and by providing a substantial cushion for those laid off. The program provides unemployment benefits for two years at as much as $2,860 a month for people who are laid off, as well as one-on-one job counseling with retraining opportunities. As a result, the Danes are unemployed for much less time compared with workers in similar countries.The US once had a similar program, the Trade Adjustment Assistance program, which was established in 1974 and administered by the Department of Labor for workers affected by trade and production in other countries. ""It was an entitlement program so that any worker who met certain conditions — that their job was displaced due to trade — had an entitlement to receive a package of income support and retraining support,"" Flynn told me. An expansive and well-funded program geared toward the AI labor-market shift would help ease turbulence for workers by providing relocation grants and wage insurance to temporarily bridge the wage gap when workers find employment in lower-paying jobs.To retrain people for an AI-based economy, the US could look to Singapore. There, workers above the age of 25 are given $500 in credits to access 24,000 courses in anything from data science to business, and a public-private retraining program makes sure skills training is matched to employers' job classifications. Every year, over 660,000 people make use of the country's national retraining program. For those concerned about productivity lags, these kinds of large-scale upgrades to education and training have the potential to fill in the gaps of a major workforce transition. Singapore's efforts have helped step up the annual labor-productivity growth rate to a respectable 3%. All these public-sector policies would still need to be complemented by private-sector investment in retraining. In an MIT survey of workers, 50% of respondents reported receiving formal skills training by their employers. Incentivizing retraining through tax credits –– such as those in New York and Georgia –– could spur employers into action and ensure everyone is ready for the AI revolution. Technology can't be uninvented — disruptive catalysts such as AI require the proactive pursuit of adapting to that change. And making workers resilient to large shocks requires recognizing that this technological wave can temporarily wipe out a large portion of the workforce, or it can be smoothly surfed to calm waters.Emil Skandul is a writer on technology and urban economics, and a Tony Blair Institute fellow.","{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-radically-reshape-job-market-global-economy-employee-labor-innovation-2023-8'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': False, 'cssSelector': '.content-lock-content'}]","{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Grace DeGraaf'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

China’s Military Employment of Artificial Intelligence and Its Security Implications



Summer 2020



Aug 16

Written By Jiayu Zhang, Former Contributor






AbstractChina’s application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has complicated and subtle implications for international and regional security. To take advantage ofAI’s structural and systematic advantages in technological innovation, China has launched a national campaign to allocate resources to AI development in both thepublic and private sectors. Other measures, including educational programs, “going out” strategy, and military-civil fusion, have also been implemented tobolster AI innovation. To prepare for “intelligentized” warfare in the future, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is capitalizing on AI technology to developunmanned intelligent combat systems, enhance battlefield situational awareness, conduct multi-domain operations, and promote training programs. The PLA has previously implemented structural reform and adapted doctrine to ensure its employment of AI fits the requirements for future warfare. China’s progress in AI and its military application may trigger regional competition for AI primacy or an AI arms race, posing an ambiguous effect on arms control concerning autonomous lethal weapon systems. PLA's efforts to enhance nuclear capabilities by leveraging AI will have both stabilizing and destabilizing influences on strategic stability andnuclear risk. Ultimately, the introduction of AI to modern battlefields may help China tip the military balance in the Western Pacific, but its potential to change theessence of armed conflict and conduct in war is limited.



INTRODUCTIONArtificial intelligence (AI), with its potential to improve the speed and accuracy of everything on the battlefield, is heating up as a key area of strategic competition and driving militaries around the world to accelerate research and development for this revolutionary technology.1 Among them, China not only intends to seize the initiative to become the “global AI leader”, but also has unparalleled potential to capitalize on the application of AI to military affairs, which have complicated and subtle implications for international and regional security.2The Chinese leadership intends to take advantage of AI to enhance its economic competitiveness and military capabilities. The New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan lays out a comprehensive blueprint for the development and innovation of AI technology in both private and public sectors. The national strategy of military-civil fusion creates a favorable environment for the rapid transfer of progress from the private sector to the military context.3 The latest defense white paper also highlights the importance of AI for the PLA by regarding “the integrated development of military intelligentization” as part of a characteristically Chinese way to strengthen the military.4However, given the significant uncertainty about the pace and trajectory of AI innovation,5 it is still hard to predict how AI might contribute to various kinds of military power, and to what extent. More importantly, the impact of any technology on military affairs depends principally on how people and organizations decide to use it.6 Whether this intelligentized technology can be integrated into PLA’s organizational structure and combat doctrine will shape China’s military posture and security strategy on issues such as defending territorial claims in the South China Sea and unifying Taiwan by force if necessary. Since China’s rapid build-up of its conventional military capabilities and growing regional ambitions have already triggered the concerns of peripheral countries, the implication of China’s significant AI research and application in the defense field deserves more attention.To explore these understudied questions, this paper focuses on how China’s development of AI technology and its military application of such technology will influence security and conflict in the region.The next section of this article examines China’s structural and systematic advantages as a totalistic party-state by briefly reviewing China’s current measures and policies, such as launching a nation-wide campaign, cultivating talent, and encouraging “going out”to promote AI innovation.The subsequent section discusses China’s efforts to apply such technological advances to the military field. AI has been used to develop unmanned combat systems, facilitate battlefield situational awareness and decision-making, conduct multi-domain operations, and promote training.The last section discusses the implications of Chinese military’s employment of AI for the balance of power, arms race, and strategic stability in East Asia.CHINA’S NATIONAL AGENDA AND POLICIES FOR AI DEVELOPMENTThe use of AI technology has become a national development strategy for China. China’s holistic approach to acquiring AI technology includes: (1) Issuing a national-wide campaign to mobilize resources, (2) deploying educational and academic efforts to cultivate a talent pool, (3) promoting “going out” to acquire knowledge abroad, and (4) requiring technology transfers with foreign companies. Finally, China is harnessing its structural and systematic advantages as a one-party, totalistic country to focus on its scientific and technological development.1. National Campaign for AI Research and DevelopmentOn many occasions after his ascension to power, President Xi Jingping renewed urgency for demands that China master new technology,7 arguing that “scientific and technological strength determines changes in the world balance of political and economic power, and determines the fate of every nation.”8 Among a variety of emerging technologies, Chinese leadership started to pay attention to AI and made it a national priority in 2015.9 Within the past several years, multiple national science and technology strategies and plans have been issued, constituting a nation-wide campaign aimed at occupying the “high ground” of AI technology.10 11 With the guidelines provided by such documents, both public and private sectors are mobilizing to participate in the AI campaign.The governments on national, provincial, and municipal levels have increasing financial and policy support for state-owned laboratories.12 Most of those labs are affiliated with China’s leading universities such as Tsinghua University’s State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technology and Systems, as well as the Chinese Academy of Science’s Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing. Moreover, various AI professional organizations and think tanks, similar to the Chinese AI Association and AI Industry Alliance, have been established with governmental sponsorship to promote the domestic exchange of AI expertise.13 Motivated by both economic incentives and political urgency, private enterprises in the AI field are engaging actively as well. As of 2018, there were 4,040 AI companies in China. Among them are China’s three largest internet giants, Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent, which have collectively invested a total of $12.8 billion in the AI industry, surpassing the combination of the four leading U.S. firms.14 Cooperation between public sectors and private companies is also encouraged. Under the leadership of Baidu, China’s National Engineering Laboratory of Deep Learning Technology was founded in 2017 to research machine-learning-based visual recognition, biometric identification, and human-computer interaction.152. Cultivating Talent PoolsTo cultivate and recruit talent and expertise in AI, China has made various efforts in the educational realm. First, a structural transformation in China’s higher educational system has paralleled the adaptation of the AI revolution in industrial sectors.16 Already, 43 universities have dedicated new AI departments, with another 35 colleges receiving funds from the Ministry of Education in 2019 to offer AI as majors.17 Academic conferences and seminars are held frequently to facilitate the diffusion and proliferation of AI know-how among Chinese academia. These efforts reflect a focus on taking advantage of China’s sizable domestic human capital base to create a pipeline of talent for the future.18Foreign material and human resources are being leveraged, as well. Thousands of foreign experts, typically university professors with specialties in different applied aspects of AI, are recruited through the “Recruitment Program of Global Experts” by Chinese institutions.19 Partnerships with foreign universities and collaborative arrangements with foreign companies like the Fudan University-Google Technology Innovation Lab were formed. China was poised to “overtake the US in the most-cited 50% of papers” in 2019,20 which displays the success of China’s efforts to overtake the United States in AI research.3. “Going Out” StrategyIn the process of building up indigenous capacity, China also continues to encourage its enterprises and students to pursue a “going out” strategy.21 This approach includes overseas mergers and acquisitions, equity investments, venture capital, and the establishment of research and development centers abroad, as well as sponsorship of study abroad programs.22Large investment consortia play a crucial role in funding Chinese and joint AI start-ups. According to CB Insights, China-based investors have engaged in tech investments amounting to $19 billion in the United States, across 641 different deals, with particular focus on AI, robotics, and augmented or virtual reality since 2012.23 China’s AI companies are also encouraged to maintain overseas labs in order to gauge local markets and access foreign research talent. Baidu, for example, runs a Silicon Valley AI Lab in Sunnyvale, CA, while Sensentime has an AI-based health lab in New Jersey and collaborates with MIT on machine intelligence. Chinese official agencies, like the China Scholarship Council, in addition to the private sector also provide fellowships to students who enroll in foreign universities to pursue AI-related disciplines.4. Technology TransferTechnology transfer from foreign entities has been an important factor contributing to China’s technological advancement. The major targets for China to acquire technology transfer are foreign companies that desire access to the Chinese market. To get access to Chinese consumers, foreign firms are required to either share their technology and patents or establish joint ventures with Chinese companies or the government; both methods allow China to gain the know-how it wants. Although China continues to take advantage of technology transfer, the role of China’s growing domestic innovation capability is reducing its reliance on this approach.5. Military-Civil FusionGiven the dual-use nature of AI technology and the leading role of the private sector in AI innovation, the capacity of the PLA to take advantage of these technological advancements for military purposes is critical for its ambition to become the “world-class force”.24 Through the national strategy of military-civil fusion, the PLA can rapidly leverage the latest advances in civilian technological fields. This strategic agenda is directed by the Central Commission for Integrated Military and Civilian Development, which is headed by Xi Jinping himself.25Under this framework, mechanisms for communication and coordination among scientific research institutes, universities, enterprises, and military industry units to share AI innovation resources are established and normalized. New joint laboratories are built as collaborations between civilian institutes and the military establishment. North China University of Technology and equipment departments of PLA’s army, navy, and rocket force founded the Military-Civil Fusion Intelligent Equipment Research Institute.26 Tsinghua University established its Military-Civil Fusion National Defense Peak Technologies Laboratory. Meanwhile, a selection of the latest AI-enabled products from private enterprises has already been procured and is currently being used by the Chinese military. For instance, PLA’s surveillance and image processing systems are reinforced by intelligent security monitors produced by Hikvision.276. China’s Structural and Institutional AdvantagesChina’s rapid rise and future trajectory in AI could be enabled by policies mentioned above, which stimulate the potential of China’s structural and systemic advantages. On a structural level, the totalistic system increases the ruling regime’s ability to exercise control and direct the socioeconomic field.28 Combined with the powerful mobilization capacity of the CCP, a huge amount of material and human resources is allocated to AI-related projects. Public institutes and private companies are ordered to concentrate their efforts on AI. To exploit synergies of this dual-use technology, close collaboration between academics, industry, and the PLA enables a critical edge for implementing and operationalizing the latest advances.29 From a demographic aspect, China’s huge population provides it with advantages on two dimensions: human resources and data resources. First, reinforced by educational arrangements, a giant human capital pool is being generated for AI talent recruitment. Second, the availability of massive amounts of data, which is crucial for machine learning, means that China has control of more than 20 percent of strategic resources in the information era.30CHINA’S APPLICATION OF AI TECHNOLOGY TO MILITARY AFFAIRSPLA strategists and academics have characterized current trends as the advent of a new military revolution, in which AI and related technologies are changing the metrics for military power. China’s military application of AI includes, but is not limited to, developing unmanned intelligent combat systems, enhancing battlefield situational awareness and decision-making, conducting multi- domain offense and defense, and facilitating advanced training, simulation, and wargaming practices. More importantly, the PLA is undergoing organizational reform and doctrine adaptation to determine how to operate AI-enabled platforms and wage intelligentized warfare in an effective manner.1. Unmanned Intelligent Combat SystemsAmong the different military applications of AI, Beijing has placed the greatest emphasis on unmanned systems. The PLA is pursuing the development of intelligent unmanned vehicles, platforms, and weapons with the expectation that they will disrupt traditional ways to wage wars.31 In recent years, many Chinese-designed unmanned vehicles and systems have been commissioned in the PLA. Multiple variants of the Caihong (“Rainbow,” CH) family of high-altitude long-endurance unmanned aerial vehicles have been used for reconnaissance and strike missions. In October 2019, WZ-8, a high-altitude super-speed stealth reconnaissance UAV, and Sharp Sword-11, a large stealth strike drone, was demonstrated during the military parade on National Day,32 revealing PLA’s rapid progress in developing intelligent UAVs. Moreover, an unmanned autonomous underwater vehicle, HSU-001, was also showcased in the parade.In addition to designing high-performance unmanned systems, Chinese military strategists are exploring innovative ways to employ these weapons. Learning from the U.S. experience of deploying drones for air strike missions and without sufficient gunships, the PLA assigned UAVs to the company level of its ground forces to provide close air support. PLA scholars have also written on the role of unmanned systems in anti-submarine warfare, airborne operations, and amphibious landing missions.33 34 35 The “swarming” concept has also been intensively studied to enable the collaborative operation of a large group of unmanned systems in a complicated electromagnetic environment.36 Besides emulating the successful experience of advanced militaries, the PLA is also interested in pursuing anti-UAV countermeasures to offset the first-move advantage of other countries.37The PLA may also incorporate AI to existing combat platforms, especially obsolete weapons, to build an “army of none”. Thousands of China’s retired second- and third- generation jet fighters like the J-7 and the J-8 can be modified to build an unmanned air fleet by installing AI-enabled self- navigation technology and autonomous combat systems that automatically pursue, distinguish, and destroy enemy targets. Given the air combat capacity of the original platforms, employment of such unmanned intelligent systems will not only take advantage of swarm systems’ low cost and overwhelming scale, but also be superior to swarms consisting of normal drones. This approach gives the Chinese military a huge asymmetric advantage with which the PLA can eliminate strategic targets while avoiding high personnel losses.38Reinforced by AI-enabled technology, speed and accuracy can be enhanced in battlefield reconnaissance, surveillance, and communication; electronic inference and radar deception; combat assessment; and fire guidance.39 As a result of the improvement of real-time situational awareness and decision- making on the battlefield, PLA’s three basic warfare elements—shooting, communication, and movement,—will be significantly strengthened.40First, the accuracy and frequency of weapon systems’ firing will be enhanced by advances in situational awareness capacity. Applied AI technology such as image and voice recognition can be used for target detection and acquisition. Hikvision’s surveillance cameras, which are able to identify potential adversarial targets automatically, may be installed on aerial weapons. By developing deep-learning methods, intelligent missiles and shells can be produced to identify targets and their weakness, evade interceptors and conduct end-phase maneuvering, which will bolster both the first-strike and retaliatory capacities of the PLA. More importantly, intensive sensors facilitated by machine learning technology will process the intelligence they capture at a flashing speed so that the time between identifying targets and attacking targets is radically reduced, increasing the rate of fire.41 In other words, situational awareness capabilities strengthened by AI will not only accelerate the traditional OODA loop but also make a “storm of steel” fired by autonomous vehicles and intelligent weapons possible.Second, installing AI systems will change the way PLA moves and maneuvers on the battlefield. In a world that is becoming one giant sensor, hiding and penetrating will be far more difficult.42 In such conditions, AI technology will help identify the weaknesses of enemy defense lines and improve routine planning by enhancing situational awareness capacity. With the intelligent analysis of geographic terrain and enemies’ posture enabled by deep learning, PLA troops can determine the safest route to maneuver to the frontline and penetrate the opponent’s defenses.Logistical support departments can manage unmanned platforms to more efficiently distribute supplies and materials based on real-time intelligence.43 44In terms of battlefield communication, AI technology is both an enabler and a beneficiary. On the one hand, intelligent distribution across the communication spectrum to maintain a complex electromagnetic environment secures the network connection among different combat branches. The development of intelligent electronic warfare equipment will help counter rival jamming and interference to communication.45 On the other hand, with the ultra-high-rate, ultra-large-capacity, and ultra-low-latency of next-generation technology like 5G, data and orders can be transferred stably and quickly between the cloud and connection terminals. Future intelligent systems based on 5G technology can more efficiently collect, transmit, and process massive battlefield data, providing real-time data analysis results for commanders.46Last and most importantly, the processing application of AI’s super data fusion and intelligence analysis will help militaries more accurately and quickly interpret information,47 which could enable the PLA to gain mastery of battlefield command and control (C2) and improve decision-making. In an era that is overloaded by the high volume of information, a new challenge facing the Chinese military is the effective processing of huge amounts of raw intelligence and the accurate interpretation of the real meaning behind information flows. Deep learning technology is likely to substantially increase the efficiency and accuracy of interpreting patterns in raw intelligence so that enemies’ intents and actions can be better understood. The introduction of machine learning algorithms to the analysis process for satellite imagery and other sensors can enable a “prediction revolution” that could support PLA’s early warning capabilities.48 For instance, AI start-up iFlytek’s voice recognition and synthesis module technology are useful for communication surveillance and radio sensing.3. Multi-domain Offense and DefenseWhile the United States begins to incorporate the concept of multiple-domain operations to its AirSea Battle doctrine to counter China’s Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) capability in the Western Pacific,49 China is also increasing its focus on cultivating versatile capacity in unconventional domains and strengthening cross-domain deterrence. With the reinforcement of AI, both offensive and defensive capabilities of the Chinese military on nuclear, cyber, and space domains will be consolidated and improved.China regards nuclear capabilities as one of the pillars of great powers. Applied neural networks and machine learning can bolster the PLA’s offensive and defensive capabilities in the nuclear domain. According to SIPRI’s survey, China’s domestic and international cross-institute collaboration in the pursuit of the benefits of integrating neural networks with hypersonic glide vehicles has become increasingly common.50 Such applications, including automatic target recognition, auto-piloting, missile fusion, and precision guidance for hypersonic platforms, will enhance the maneuverability and penetration capacity of nuclear missiles, thereby reshaping conventional and nuclear deterrence dynamics.51 On the defensive side, the situational awareness capacity enhanced by AI technology can strengthen China’s nuclear retaliatory capabilities by improving early-warning and missile defense systems. Operating at machine speeds through the deployment of autonomous interception systems can protect nuclear arsenal and missile bases when facing saturation strikes.52 Application of automation-enabled launch-on-warning to its missiles can strengthen the credibility of China’s retaliation and the principle of mutual vulnerability it seeks.53The PLA seeks to leverage big data analytics, machine learning, and automation to enhance the defense of critical military and civilian networks and scale the effects of offensive cyber operations.54 The victory of AlphaGo inspired Chinese strategists; since well-trained AI programs can innovate new tactics in go games, they should also be able to create new, previously unimaginable ways to conduct cyber-attacks. The offensive advantage in cyberspace stems from the limitation of human logic to detect systemic weakness. However, by utilizing technology such as pattern recognition and deep learning, AI can not only be helpful for detecting the vulnerability of enemies’ networks but can also assist the protection of friendly systems by detecting loopholes that need to be fixed. The PLA’s Strategic Support Forces’ (SSF) Information Engineering University has developed methods to identify and mitigate Distributed Denial of Service attacks through pattern matching, statistical analysis, and machine learning. A prediction path for cybersecurity based on deep learning has been formulated by researchers from the National University of Defense Technology.55 Further, the PLA can profile targets and customize operations to shape, guide, and control individuals’ ideas and emotions based on intelligent analysis, which can be advantageous in psychological warfare.564. Training, Simulation, and WargamingThe PLA will likely take advantage of AI to increase the sophistication of its simulations, war-gaming, and drills.57 Due to the lack of opportunities for Chinese commanders and soldiers to gain actual combat experience, the PLA’s new combat-oriented training places great emphasis on simulation and software-based wargaming. More importantly, the PLA is accustomed to investigating emerging concepts and testing new weapons through simulation. Therefore, the PLA has great incentive to integrate AI technology with its computerized wargames and military simulators to “enhance the level of realism and create an artificially intelligent ‘Blue Force’”.58 In recent years, several wargaming contests involving human-machine confrontations have been held by the National Defense University’s Joint Operation College and the National University of Defense Technology’s Systemic Engineering Department.5. Organizational reform and doctrine transformationEmerging technologies only make military revolution and ascension of military capabilities possible. To realize their full potential, these technologies must be incorporated into new processes and executed through a new organizational structure. In the case of Chinese military, its organizational reform launched in 2015 and doctrine adaptation may ensure its employment of AI technology is fitting for the future of intelligentized war.First, the PLA underwent a comprehensive reform of its force structure, which can reshape its capability to win intelligentized warfare. The most significant measure has been the establishment of its SSF. According to the Chinese Ministry of Defense, SSF “comprises supporting forces for battlefield environment, information communications, information security, and new technology testing.”59 In intelligentized warfare, the SSF would operate AI- enabled platforms to provide other branches of the Chinese military with sound situational awareness and support decision-making through rapid intelligence processing. As the new basic combat unit among PLA ground forces, integrated brigades distribute strategic support teams at the battalion level. These teams are responsible for operating UAVs and other intelligent systems to enhance the intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and long-range strike capabilities of small units. Furthermore, the Chinese military also reorganized its affiliated research institutes and military universities and adjusted its recruitment policy to realize better management and allocation of human capital.When it comes to combat doctrine, the adaptation is moderate. One observer argues that the PLA “could prove less averse to the prospect of taking humans out of the loop” because “Chinese discussions about keeping a human in the loop in technical writings remain limited to nonexistent.”60 However, the PLA’s way of fighting is rooted deeply in a strong strategic culture arguing that human beings are the ultimate determination of war. Although new concepts like “intelligence dominance” and “algorithm-centric warfare” have appeared in official military writings recently, the PLA is still forming a coherent doctrine that mitigates the conflict between AI’s trend to keep humans out of the loop and its own military culture emphasizing the role of humans.61 In fact, some patterns of AI-based combat align with Chinese approaches to war. For instance, swarm tactics, which use a large amount of low-cost unmanned systems to saturate enemies, are similar to the guerilla tactics that the Chinese troops used in WWII.It should be noted China’s weaponization of AI is also occurring in the information and psychological domain. The PLA’s strategists have begun to discuss how to win on cognitive dimension and seize “metal/cognitive domination” (制脑权) in future warfare.62 On the one hand, polymeric technology, which combines brain science, biological technology, and artificial intelligence, will not only improve soldiers’ cognitive ability but also create an effective brain-machine interface, which may make some sci-fi super soldiers possible. Additionally, advanced intelligent algorithms can be used to fight a war in the realm of propaganda. By promoting domestic cohesion through the control of public opinion and disruption of opponents’ efforts to influence the Chinese press, AI will engage this new dimension of the “people’s war” in the information era.SECURITY IMPLICATIONS OF CHINESE MILITARY’S EMPLOYMENT OF AIChina’s development of AI and its application of such technologies to military affairs impacts on many regional and international issues. This article focuses on the Western Pacific, where most of China’s major security concerns and the potential flashpoints for future military confrontation are centered. For a region that is already tense and crowded, a regional competition for AI primacy may trigger an AI arms race and pose an ambiguous effect on arms control concerning autonomous lethal weapon systems. The PLA's efforts to enhance nuclear capabilities through AI will have both stabilizing and destabilizing influence on strategic stability. Ultimately, the introduction of AI to the modern battlefield may help China tip the military balance, but its potential to change the essence of armed conflict and the way in which war is waged is limited.1. Arms Race and Arms ControlSome voices in China are calling upon the Chinese government to avoid an AI arms race. While it is hard to define whether the struggle for technological primacy fits the definition of an arms race, the competition among actors in the Western Pacific for advanced AI technology has already intensified. South Korea has allocated many resources to research AI-based command systems, aviation training systems, and object-tracking techniques.63 Other efforts made by Seoul to militarize AI technology include works on the Exobrain and ADAMs projects for the potential enhancement of C4ISR, virtual combat exercises, and self-navigation algorithms.64 Even though its general technological capabilities are nascent, North Korea engages in the competition by focusing on some aspects of AI that can be used to elevate its current military operations. It has been suggested that Kim Il Sung University and the Korea Computer Center have advanced the Ryongnamsan 5.1 speech-recognition systems, audio classification, and deep fakes to reinforce cyber aggressions.65China’s rapid progress in AI and its military application have encouraged such competition and may trigger a potential arms race in two ways. First, the PLA’s increasing military power facilitated by its application of AI technology has already activated a security dilemma, especially concerning China’s increasing assertiveness in territorial disputes and growing ambitions about the regional order. The PLA’s employment of AI-enabled early-warning systems and unmanned intelligent combat vehicles will enhance China’s awareness of Japanese and South Korean operations in disputed areas like the Senkaku Islands and enable a quick response capability. From the perspective of other countries in the region, China’s willingness to escalate in such scenarios will increase because its AI technology would provide it with a decisive advantage in a conflict with limited costs, despite increasing the potential of accidental escalation.66 Other countries’ have begun to pursue more defense measures, a move that reflects concern about China’s potential threat, including the development of weapon-grade AI technology. Such defensive measures suggest that tensions triggered by the security dilemma in the region will be more complicated and expand beyond an AI arms race. Nuclear proliferation, targeting civilian infrastructure that supports AI technology, and more cyber aggression may be seen in this context.Second, China’s success in influencing U.S. strategic calculation and military posture by military employment of AI may encourage other countries to copy its success. Other countries who see themselves as adversaries of the United States may be motivated to increase AI investment and attempt to install related technology to their missiles to exercise coercion and threats. For U.S. allies like Japan, the introduction of AI in early-warning, situational awareness, and intelligence processing may not only help reduce reliance on U.S. extended deterrence, but also strengthen their ability to counter regional rivals like China and North Korea.Thus, the proliferation of AI technology, especially those can be weaponized, poses challenges to the arms control community in the region. Given the highly dual-use nature of AI, civilian AI technology cooperation between countries may contribute to the unintentional proliferation of destructive AI systems, a situation which is similar to the dual-use dilemma of nuclear cooperation.67 On the practical level, weapon-, behavior-, or country-focused controls will face different problems ranging from how to define controlled weapons to how to verify the control measures.68 On the political level, countries' attitudes toward AI arms control are ambiguous. In 2018, China demonstrated its “desire to negotiate and conclude” a new protocol for the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons to ban the use of autonomous lethal weapons systems.69 However, the delegation stressed that the ban should only apply to the use of such weapons, and not to their development, revealing China’s actual misgivings regarding arms control for autonomous systems.702. Strategic Stability and Nuclear RiskNuclear strategic stability is understood as “a state of affairs in which countries are confident that their adversaries would not be able to undermine their nuclear deterrence capability” using nuclear, conventional, cyber or other means.71 Given the dynamics of nuclear posture of major powers in the region and the potential role of nuclear escalation in certain scenarios, AI-enabled improvement of the PLA’s multi-domain operation capabilities has both destabilizing and stabilizing impacts on strategic stability.China has long been concerned about false negatives from its early warning systems, which may result in failures to detect nuclear attacks.72 To some extent, such concerns are rooted in China’s assumptions about its own early warning deficiencies and its own inability to counter a stealthy and prompt precision strike from the United States.73 Regarding China’s employment of nuclear weapons, military-technology considerations stressing the plausible U.S. conventional military operation against Chinese nuclear capabilities are the reasons behind China’s use of limited nuclear escalation.74 As a result, if China gains greater situational awareness and can strengthen its nuclear retaliatory capabilities by applying AI technology to its C4ISR and early- warning systems, some of its insecurities about a “bolt-out-of-the-blue” strike may be mitigated, which will stabilize the nuclear risk.75Yet China’s insecurities are not simply a question of technology. The key factors are China’s perception of U.S. nuclear posture and its assumption of U.S. intent. In this sense, China’s use of AI and autonomy for nuclear offense and defense could take on destabilizing qualities. For Beijing, the prospect of the United States resuming a forward-deployed, tactical nuclear posture exacerbates its sense of encirclement. The issuance of the 2018 U.S. Nuclear Posture Review worsens the context. China views the documents’ focus on ballistic missile defense and conventional prompt global strike as preemptive and destabilizing.76 Additionally, the proposal for the enlargement of the U.S. arsenal of low-yield submarine-launched ballistic and cruise missiles and the concept of using nuclear coercion to preemptively de-escalate a conventional conflict like Taiwan scenario further elicit Chinese concerns over U.S. intent. AI and autonomous technology offer Beijing the potential to respond to such a posture. China could deploy swarms to track and intercept U.S. dual- capable platforms. Whether intentionally or unintentionally, an escalatory scenario could develop. While the PLA’s deployment of advanced AI-enabled early warning systems and automation-enabled launch-on-fire missiles may mitigate China’s fear of false negatives, it may intensify U.S. concerns about false positives,such as a nuclear war caused by accidental fire or false detection.3. Military Balance and Future WarfareAI is helpful for enhancing battlefield situational awareness, especially reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (RSTA) technology;77 a key element for the PLA’s A2/AD capabilities. China’s military application of AI technology will not only reinforce the RSTA component of its A2/AD system but also add a new dimension to the implementation of this strategy.According to Biddle and Oelrich, military advantages provided by A2/ AD are only strong over controlled landmasses and weaken over greater distances due to the change of “RSTA’s effectiveness with the complexity of the background against which it must detect targets.”78 For instance, the effectiveness and detection range of radar, which is “the most robust solution to the demands of sensing mobile targets over wide areas,”79 is limited by multiple elements ranging from Earth’s curvature to its defenders’ survivability. Mobile sensors like early-warning aircraft and seaborne radars are almost exposed to enemies’ fire because of the low-complexity of their background. While such RSTA systems’ effectiveness decreases when far away from landmasses and makes them vulnerable to enemies’ attacks, the capabilities of A2/AD’s fire solutions, like long-range missiles, will be dramatically weakened. Nevertheless, AI technology offers methods to solve these problems. First, rapid data processing reduces the time needed for radars to maintain operating status.Vulnerable sensors can be shut down and concealed before enemy firepower approaches. Second, fixed high-power radars are no longer the only solution for long-range RSTA. Swarms of intelligent UAVs and UUVs can be sent to open airspace and sea to conduct reconnaissance missions. Every vehicle in such a system is an intelligence-gathering and analysis hub, which means collection and processing can be finished on the same end. This unmanned tactic is superior to the traditional OODA-style way of fighting in terms of low cost and high efficiency. Furthermore, unmanned intelligent combat systems like modified unmanned J-8 can replace long-range missiles strike to be the main strike choice. Combined with other technological progress, like a new aircraft carrier that uses electromagnetic launch systems to allow quick delivery of UAV fleets, the PLA’s A2/AD capabilities will be significantly strengthened and might ultimately help China realize its ambition for regional “command of the commons"".80This trend of increasing Chinese military power resulted from the application of AI to the national defense field; however, it will not change the essence of armed conflict and the methods of waging war. AI itself is an enabler, like a combustion engine and electricity, as opposed to a weapon.81The function of AI in military affairs is to enhance the capacity of existing systems and platforms in terms of speed and efficiency, rather than “turning a stone to a gold”. AI can speed up war, but it cannot change the essence of war.82 As a result, the nature and performance of original weapon systems still matter. More importantly, wide deployment of AI-based systems still faces some serious challenges. First and foremost, a huge volume of high-quality data is required to train AI algorithms and enable machine learning. On the one hand, war-related data is sensitive and not easy to access. On the other hand, it is very difficult to code some elements of warfare into machine- readable quantitative data. Second, when AI algorithms run at flash speeds, it is extremely challenging for other military hardware to keep up with them. To make sure those hardware can keep pace with AI programs, stable ultra-speed communication and comprehensive data-link networks are indispensable. The PLA still needs to enhance the interconnectedness among its units and organs, develop next-generation communications technology, and establish reliable and secure data links. These requirements echo China’s prioritization of 5G, block chain, and quantum computing. Furthermore, radical advance and improvement in basic physics and machinery engineering should be achieved to optimize the performance of original hardware. Third, scientists still find it challenging to understand the behavior of AI, creating a risk of unreliability.83 Armed forces like the PLA, which take such issues very seriously, will be very cautious in the deployment and employment of AI-based systems if they cannot ensure their battlefield reliability and political loyalty.84ENDNOTES1  Michael C.

Artificial Intelligence in Human Resource Management seems inevitable. However, there are some concerns, such as the time and resources required to implement AI, and the limitations it poses in communicating important variables like company culture and so on, writes Frank Hamilton Freelance writer.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has earned its place in the world of business and does not look to be backing out anytime soon. The revolutionary tech has brought about game-changing developments that have thickened the margin lines, especially in the discipline of Human Resource Management (HR).
Giving its knack for accuracy and its effectiveness with time, the future for Artificial Intelligence in Human Resource Management seems inevitable. However, there are some concerns, such as the time and resources required to implement AI, and the limitations it poses in communicating important variables like company culture and so on.
There are several benefits as well as disadvantages of implementing Artificial Intelligence in Human Resource Management. The topic has generated debate in recent years; who have been the primary benefactors, and who has not been so happy with the development?However, for companies that are considering whether or not to implement Artificial Intelligence for their Human Resource Department, it is essential to take into consideration your company’s goals because this will significantly influence the decision reached.

Pros and Cons of Artificial Intelligence
Here we will discuss the key areas that concern Artificial Intelligence with respect to Human Resource Management.
Employee Hiring
A company, being a team is only as efficient as its weakest member. However, searching for the first-class talent that meets the all-round demands of your organization is never an easy task. However, with the proficiency and time management effectiveness of Artificial Intelligence through Digital Hiring TechnologyOpens a new window , this can quickly become a simple process. However, this remedy does come with its own pitfalls.

Pros: Implementing Artificial intelligence in the employee hiring process rules out the issue of human bias. Unlike the human nature that is prone to a degree of bias during employee hiring, Artificial Intelligence can seamlessly sort out, screen, and delegate qualified candidates to appropriate roles within the organization in little or no time without the problem of human bias.
Cons: Although Artificial Intelligence can do a clean job at recruiting without human bias, they may not be able to weigh and implement important variables such as company culture and similar company values during decision making.

Also, as Artificial Intelligence systems are designed to learn from the user, an AI system can also “learn” to be biased. There was a case study of Amazon’s AI system favoring male candidates over female candidates; hence, the company had to put it away and resort for better digital hiring solutions.
Employee-Engagement
Clear communication is a necessity, especially for larger companies. Success in this area helps a company to optimize its performance objectives and grow towards the company ideal.

Pros: the process of employee engagement can be automated through Artificial Intelligence. The system can perform intelligent surveys and gather feedback in real-time. AI can also perform Personalized Internal Communication directly with employees instead of the traditional issuing of survey sheets; Artificial intelligence can provide the management with an all in one and detailed picture of the various challenges each employee is facing at work.
Cons: there may still be a need for human interaction as the system may not completely exhaust all the challenges faced by each individual.

Learning and Staff Development 
One of the major responsibilities of the Human Resource Management department is Staff Development; in terms of educating them on the new programs, new procedures, tools, and so on, associated with their role in the organization. Artificial Intelligence, like an Effective Learning Management SystemOpens a new window , can be instrumental in smoothening the process and progress of learning for all employees.

Pros – through eLearning, Artificial Intelligence can be used to educate staff rapidly and effectively. The system can also monitor and evaluate each employee’s performance to ensure that no employee is declining in the learning process so that the team completes each phase together and on time.
Cons – this process may further dwindle human connection, which is vital for staff, especially if they’re working as a team.

Automated FAQs
Human Resource Department is usually faced with the responsibility of responding to the same or similar queries all the time. For instance, queries concerning Paycheque, Holidays, and such are all duties of the Human Resource department; the loop can become dull and time-wasting. AI can be programmed to handle these FAQs.

Pros: Artificial Intelligence can be automated to attend to frequently asked questions, thereby saving a lot of time. Chatbots and virtual assistants are the most popular solutions for cases of this nature. They help leverage time and can be depended upon to answer all the time accurately.
Cons: it has become well known that chatbots can easily get hacked. This ultimately compromises the security of any sensitive information given by an employee, and can also become an avenue for unforeseen cyber attacks.

Human Capital Management 
Finding and recruiting top-notch talent is only one part of the job. Afterward, employees need to be followed up, natured, and given adequate assistance so that they grow individually and within the organization.
If an employee does not feel like they are making headway both in their careers and personal lives, then there is a considerable chance that they will choose another profession. Artificial Intelligence can be automated to assist the Human Resource department in ensuring that employees grow persistently both individually and in their careers.

Pros – Artificial Intelligence through Automated Employee SurveysOpens a new window  can assist Human Resource departments in ascertaining how well each staff is doing based on their performance in an individual set of tasks that define their roles in the company. This can be achieved through automated performance analysis. This will help to direct employee’s career paths and optimize the working force in the company.
Cons – the system can get hacked and risk losing sensitive data.

Conclusion
There are several practical applications of Artificial Intelligence with respect to Human Resource Management. In fact, artificial intelligence can be automated to assist hand in hand with the human resource management department throughout the employee lifecycle. However, there are also downsides that could cause fatal problems if the system is not programmed or managed correctly. The subject of Artificial Intelligence is far from complete; as with any other profitable business decision, it is a risk that should be taken with adequate consideration.

Seeing tablets and drones on the same work sites as hard hats and safety vests is common.Now helmet-mounted cameras capture footage of a site to orchestrate when new crews or materials should arrive, and precise sensors can detect whether a new window is a few millimeters off the project blueprint and needs to be adjusted. And A.I. is starting to be used in buying and selling real estate: JLL, a global broker, recently introduced its own chatbot to provide insights to its clients.This expanded analysis of data is laying the groundwork for what many hope will be substantial improvements in accuracy, speed and efficiency by reducing the bloated timelines and waste that have made construction increasingly costly.“The construction industry is the largest in the world, in terms of dollars spent, yet we are the least productive in terms of technological adoption and productivity gains,” said David Jason Gerber, a University of Southern California professor whose research focuses on advanced technology in construction.But the industry’s embrace of A.I. technology faces challenges, including concerns over accuracy and hallucinations, in which a system provides an answer that is incorrect or nonsensical.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAnd further data collection has been a knotty problem, in large part because of the nature of huge construction projects: No two developments are the same, with wildly varying topography and local regulations, and new teams of contractors and subcontractors coming together for each project. It’s akin to starting a multimillion-dollar business for every sizable project.ImageAt a construction site for South Station Tower in Boston, robots are maneuvered by remote control.Credit...Tony Luong for The New York TimesImageThe site also uses technology like helmet-mounted cameras to track the progress of the project.Credit...Tony Luong for The New York TimesImageA robot created by Boston Dynamics is among the artificial intelligence technology tools used at the site.Credit...Tony Luong for The New York TimesCoordinating the complex ballet of supplies, labor and timetables remains a daunting task. But start-ups and investors see an opportunity, especially as machine learning models, which ingest enormous amounts of data to discern patterns and predict how similar situations will progress, are used to improve project performance.The pandemic had already pushed construction firms to adopt more digital tools to allow them to work on site during lockdowns, accelerating the development of new technology, said Sarah Liu, a partner at Fifth Wall, a venture capital firm focused on real estate investments.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“The best companies aren’t touting themselves as A.I. companies,” she said. “They’re touting themselves as problem-solving companies.”The construction consulting firm nPlan, led by Dev Amratia, who helped draft Britain’s national artificial intelligence strategy, uses complex algorithms to map out the progress of vast infrastructure projects and avoid mistakes or supply gaps. Its machine learning system was trained on a database of more than 740,000 projects.The firm’s largest project to date, a $11 billion overhaul of railroad infrastructure in Northern England, will use the lessons gleaned from studying that vast array of projects to create detailed, real-time project maps for builders, which is expected to shave up to 5 percent off the total cost.Buildots, a start-up in Israel that provides project management guidance via wearable cameras that analyze building progress, signed a deal for its first New York project, a mixed-use development in Manhattan. The firm commissioned a study of 64 international building sites, and it found that just 46 percent of the average work site was being used at any time, evidence of poor organization and scheduling.“At the best construction site we’ve studied, progress varied by 30 percent each week,” said Aviv Leibovici, the firm’s chief product officer and a co-founder. “I think there are massive inefficiencies in this industry.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTConstruction firms have also made significant investment in their in-house technology. Avison Young’s Project Management Services division claims its proprietary software and management programs can, on average, cut development time 20 percent.ImageThe 51-story development in Boston is being built with the aid of programs that can even predict accidents.Credit...Tony Luong for The New York TimesAn affiliate of Suffolk, a large construction firm based in Boston, invested $110 million to fund construction start-ups, and Suffolk has a team of 30 data analysts collecting and scrutinizing information from job sites. At a construction site for South Station Tower in Boston, a 51-story development by Hines, cranes have cameras that document and label steel being used on the building’s frame, creating a data set expected to be used on other projects in the future. Additional programs are being used to track progress and even predict accidents.“We have zero unemployment in the industry; technology is just going to help existing workers do more,” said John Fish, chairman and chief executive of Suffolk. “A.I. is just going to replace the companies that don’t use A.I.”There is trepidation about A.I., and its reported issues with accuracy, being used in an industry where safety is so important. Programs like ChatGPT have an unfortunate tendency to occasionally make up answers based on incorrect predictions, said Julien Moutte, chief technology officer at Bentley Systems, a construction software firm.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“In infrastructure, this is something we can’t afford,” he said. “We can’t have A.I. hallucinate the design of a bridge.”But the purported ability to work faster and cheaper has proved attractive. Dusty Robotics, a tech firm in Mountain View, Calif., develops autonomous devices to trace building blueprints on construction sites, a job typically done by hand. While researching the industry, the company’s chief executive, Tessa Lau, observed workers measuring out plans with chalk and tape; some workers had even tried taping pens to Roombas.Ms. Lau was worried about the reaction that laborers would have to robots and A.I. encroaching on their job site. But in an industry desperate to attract younger workers, offering potential apprentices the ability to use drones and robots can help with recruitment and retention.ImageCarpenters learning how to use a robot created by Dusty Robotics.Credit...Jim Wilson/The New York TimesImageA reflector is positioned to align the robot to a laser.Credit...Jim Wilson/The New York TimesImageThe union training site in Pleasanton is used to help carpenters hone their skills and learn new ones, like robotics.Credit...Jim Wilson/The New York TimesTony Hernandez, a union carpentry trainer in Northern California who teaches apprentices to use drones and Dusty robots, sees these technologies as “just another tool.” He prefers the robot to trace lines instead of having to bend down and trace himself, meaning less wear and tear on his knees.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“This is a great retention tool,” he said. “It’s brought in kids who grew up on Xbox and can figure out these tools in a five-hour class.”Dusty has 120 units on sites across the United States, but that is just the beginning. Ms. Lau calls the units, which can collect gigabytes of data, “Trojan horses to train the A.I.s of the future.”Reducing risk may ultimately be where this technology makes its mark. Depending on the location and nature of work, insurance can make up as much as 10 percent of the cost of a single project, which can easily be hundreds of millions of dollars. Now, with A.I. providing better ways to keep on task, there is less risk and cheaper insurance options.Shepherd, an insurance start-up, uses construction data to provide contractors with cheaper premiums. Wint, an Israeli start-up that uses proprietary sensors and algorithms to eliminate water damage, which leads to roughly a third of damage claims on construction sites, has been used on roughly 2,500 projects. A study by Munich Re found Wint can cut the loss rate 90 percent.“Insurance costs can be the difference between whether or not projects are able to be sustainably financed,” said Justin Levine, a co-founder and the chief executive of Shepherd.A correction was made on Aug. 15, 2023: An earlier version of this article misspelled the give name of the chief technology officer at Bentley Systems.

The Generative AI Revolution Is Underway
By Brent Orrell
AEIdeas
August 15, 2023



FacebookTwitterLinkedIn
2023 is shaping up to be a pivotal year for artificial intelligence, with the rise of generative AI poised to transform industries and reshape workforces. The latest McKinsey Global Survey on AI confirms the increasing market penetration of tools like DALL-E and ChatGPT and outlines how workers and employers see the technology affecting work patterns in the coming years. 
One-third of survey respondents say their organizations are using generative AI regularly in at least one business function. Respondents across regions, industries, and seniority levels say they are already incorporating generative AI tools into their business.


Marketing, sales, product development, and customer service operations are the top functions using generative AI. Common use cases include drafting text, personalized marketing, identifying trends in customer needs, and using customer service chatbots.
The organizations achieving the most value from AI—what the survey calls “AI high performers”—are using generative AI in product development and supply chain management. These leading companies are also twice as likely to see generative AI’s top benefit as creating new revenue streams rather than reducing costs.
Workers and organizations expect generative AI to change work. Three-quarters of respondents expect AI to cause significant or disruptive change in their industries within three years, with tech and financial services companies predicting the most change. Disruption, however, does not necessarily imply displacement. As shown below, the disruptive impact is much more likely to manifest as reskilling than in job loss. Nearly four in 10 firms expect to reskill over 20 percent of employees in the next three years to help current workers adapt to AI. The Forbes Technology Council recently identified 20 new business roles—from prompt engineering to AI ethics to AI output verification—that will add to business headcounts.




The survey also suggests that many organizations are unprepared for the widespread use of generative AI. Since McKinsey’s previous survey, the same 55 percent or so of organizations have adopted AI, typically in just one to two functions like product development and customer service. And just 23 percent of respondents say that at least 5 percent of their organizations’ earnings last year is attributable to their use of AI—essentially the same as the previous survey. These results suggest that AI use remains limited in scope and there is significant room to capture value through improved efficiency, productivity, and labor substitution.
In a couple areas, AI implementation is experiencing significant lags. Though hiring for AI-related roles has become somewhat easier in the past year, the demand for data scientists, data engineers, and machine learning engineers continues to outstrip supply, and talent development and recruitment remains challenging.


Lastly, just 21 percent of firms have established formal policies for governing employee use of generative AI, creating something of a Wild West of AI use in offices. As the chart below shows, many organizations are worried about AI risks, such as generating inaccurate information, cybersecurity, and intellectual property infringement, but they are largely unprepared to address them. This pattern will undoubtedly lead to some misuse and challenges that we can expect to hear about in (sometimes) amusing and (usually) breathless media coverage of the always-forthcoming-never-quite-here AI apocalypse.


The overall message of this and other recent reports is three-fold. It remains very early days for generative AI; the big effects are still over the horizon. Second, contrary to some of the worst fears about employment impacts, in the short- and medium-term, the biggest effects are likely to be felt in upskilling rather than in worker displacements. Finally, the most important longer-term impact seems to be that AI will create more, higher-value, and higher-skill job opportunities than it destroys. It’s not an easy path but with proper support from employers and government, the benefits of AI are likely to significantly outweigh its costs.

As companies race to keep up with the hype around generative, employers are looking to hire workers with deep knowledge of the technology.Since the beginning of this year, the number of listings related to generative AI on the job site Indeed quadrupled, according to data from Indeed obtained by The Wall Street Journal.Without a big enough supply of experienced AI professionals to fill the demand for these roles, US companies are offering competitive six-figure salaries in attempts to woo skilled workers, recruiters told the Journal.

""This is pure market economics,"" Paul J. Groce, a partner at executive recruitment firm Leathwaite, told the Journal. ""We do not magically have thousands of additional AI developers, product managers and everything else.""

Last month, Netflix made headlines for offering up to $900,000 for an AI-focused product manager role amid the actors' and writers' strikes.Dating app Hinge is hiring a VP of artificial intelligence who could earn up to $398,000 a year to lead the app's AI strategy, and Amazon posted a job listing for a senior manager in applied science and generative AI who could land a salary as high as $340,300.It's not just tech companies getting in on the AI hype. Capital One posted a listing for a distinguished engineer of generative AI, offering a salary of up to $325,700, while Walmart is seeking a senior manager for its conversational AI platform who could earn between $168,000 and $252,000 a year.""As advancements take shape, we're creating new jobs and opportunities for associates to learn new skills,"" a Walmart spokesperson said.

Early-to-mid career workers familiar with AI can also cash in — in some cases with nothing more than a college degree.Meta, for instance, posted a job listing for a generative AI research engineer with an annual salary as high as $137,000. The company is seeking recent college grads for the role. And chip giant Nvidia posted an entry-level job opening for a generative AI research scientist. The position has a salary between $156,000 and $247,250.

Amazon, Capital One, Meta, and Nvidia did not respond to Insider's requests for comment when asked for specifics about their AI-focused roles.The growth of generative AI-roles comes as companies warm up to the idea that understanding generative AI tools like ChatGPT may, in fact, be a skill that can improve products and boost productivity.

In June, Crossover, a search engine for remote jobs, closed applications for a senior director role and a chief product officer role. Both listings offered $800,000 salaries and required that applicants apply ChatGPT to their work.""As this tech is still so new, there is a race to bring on employees with this skill in order for the company to stay cutting edge,"" Stacie Haller, the chief career advisor at job site Resume Builder, told Insider. ""And it looks like companies are willing to pay to do so.""

""We do not magically have thousands of additional AI developers, product managers and everything else.""Last month, Netflix made headlines for offering up to $900,000 for an AI-focused product manager role amid the actors' and writers' strikes.Dating app Hinge is hiring a VP of artificial intelligence who could earn up to $398,000 a year to lead the app's AI strategy, and Amazon posted a job listing for a senior manager in applied science and generative AI who could land a salary as high as $340,300.It's not just tech companies getting in on the AI hype. Capital One posted a listing for a distinguished engineer of generative AI, offering a salary of up to $325,700, while Walmart is seeking a senior manager for its conversational AI platform who could earn between $168,000 and $252,000 a year.""As advancements take shape, we're creating new jobs and opportunities for associates to learn new skills,"" a Walmart spokesperson said.Early-to-mid career workers familiar with AI can also cash in — in some cases with nothing more than a college degree.Meta, for instance, posted a job listing for a generative AI research engineer with an annual salary as high as $137,000. The company is seeking recent college grads for the role. And chip giant Nvidia posted an entry-level job opening for a generative AI research scientist. The position has a salary between $156,000 and $247,250.Amazon, Capital One, Meta, and Nvidia did not respond to Insider's requests for comment when asked for specifics about their AI-focused roles.The growth of generative AI-roles comes as companies warm up to the idea that understanding generative AI tools like ChatGPT may, in fact, be a skill that can improve products and boost productivity.In June, Crossover, a search engine for remote jobs, closed applications for a senior director role and a chief product officer role.

Not necessarily, and here's why. Medora LeeUSA TODAYPlayPauseSound OnSound Off0:001:26AD0:15SKIPClosedCaptionOpen ShareEnter Full ScreenExit Full ScreenWhen Carlos Cabrera and his family arrived in the U.S. from Venezuela in 2019 hoping to build a better future, life was challenging at first. Despite having a degree in chemical engineering and years of experience working for a global oil company, he couldn’t find a job to match his skills.Cabrera ended up taking whatever jobs he could to make ends meet – working at a meat factory and Costco, driving a truck and delivering food. Then he had two strokes of luck: a nonprofit organization popped up in a job search, and he discovered artificial intelligence.From there, his life changed. The nonprofit, Upwardly Global, helps immigrants and refugees with internationally recognized certificates, degrees, or work experience restart their careers. They helped Cabrera purchase a laptop and provided him with career training. Then AI helped him hone his resume and cover letters. “I use tech to my advantage,” said Cabrera, for whom English is a second language. He now sends out well-written cover letters that better match his skills to the job descriptions by using ChatGPT, an AI chatbot that uses natural language processing to create humanlike conversational dialogue. Within the last couple of months, he even landed a job as a project manager at a global supplier of energy products and solutions.Is AI changing the job market?Many headlines center around how AI will take over people's jobs. AI has even become a major sticking point among Hollywood actors and writers afraid their work can essentially be used to train AI that can then put them out of a job.However, AI also has the potential to level the playing field for nonnative English speakers applying for jobs by helping them better present themselves to English-speaking employers, research by Emma van Inwegen, a Ph.D. student at MIT's Sloan School of Management, has shown. Between June 8 and July 14, 2021, she studied 480,948 job seekers who applied for jobs that require English to be spoken but who mostly lived in nations where English is not the native language.Of those who used AI, 7.8% were more likely to be hired. They also earned wages that were 8.4% higher than those who didn’t use AI, according to her working paper, co-authored by MIT Sloan Ph.D. student Zanele Munyikwa and MIT Sloan professor John J. Horton. Their research also showed those AI users earned $18.62 per hour on average versus $17.17 per hour for those who had received no resume help.The study also found no evidence employers were less satisfied with workers who used AI to get the job. How can AI benefit businesses?AI can also give small businesses an efficiency and production boost that can help them compete better against companies with deeper pockets. Keeping costs down for small businesses amid high inflation and rising wages has been difficult, but some have found help through AI. Anip Patel, founder of CaPatel Investments, an early stage venture capital firm that invests predominantly in companies that promote South Asian values, says AI has helped his company work more efficiently. Creating brochures and presentations that used to take several days of research and writing can now be done in hours with AI, freeing up time for his assistant to do other work. Of course, he said a human must check the work AI does for accuracy but even with that, the time it takes to complete the project is still significantly less. “It’s good for business owners and making money,” he said. Patel isn't the only one who sees that. Constant Contact, a small-business-focused digital marketing and automation platform, said of the 486 small businesses it surveyed in June, 91% of those using AI said the technology has made their business more successful, and they are using it to regain valuable time in their week, cut down on manual mistakes and grow faster. Additionally, 28% said they expect AI and automation to save them at least $5,000 over the next 12 months.Planning trips:Make travel easy: We tested ChatGPT itineraries in 5 US tourist spotsAs AI improves, will AI make us jobless? In the short term, AI will displace some people, but experts say AI ultimately will create more, though different, jobs and benefit everyone. The World Economic Forum said in October 2020 that while AI would likely eliminate 85 million jobs globally by 2025, it would also generate 97 million new jobs in fields ranging from big data and machine learning to information security and digital marketing.“AI is good for candidates because it helps match the ideal candidate with the right job, which can really benefit everyone,” said Jeremy Schiff, chief executive at RecruitBot, which uses AI to help companies recruit candidates. “People are happier because they’re in the right job, appreciated and valued more. And they don’t have to do 30 interviews and get no job offers.” On the flip side, companies can fill jobs faster. “We are five times more accurate at identifying the right type of person versus the previous approach,” he said. “If hiring managers had to read through 10 resumes then, we only have to read through two now.”  Also, if in the middle of interviewing candidates, a company realizes it needs different skills for a particular job, AI can pivot quickly and start looking for different candidates instead of having to stop, rewrite and repost the job description and wait for a new batch of applicants. “No one is blindly hiring just using AI technology,” Schiff said.

VeleClick to share this pageClick for PDFClick to print this pageSeyfarth Synopsis: Last week, the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) filed a settlement agreement in a lawsuit that many are calling the EEOC’s “first-ever” artificial intelligence discrimination in hiring lawsuit. The settlement serves as a strong reminder of the EEOC’s ongoing emphasis on AI and algorithmic bias, and a reminder to employers that the results of any technology-assisted screening process should comply with existing civil-rights laws. In this alert, Seyfarth discusses key takeaways from this settlement for all employers, regardless of whether their hiring technology might be characterized as an “artificial intelligence” tool.
The EEOC’s lawsuit, against iTutor Group and its related companies (“iTutor”), involved an employer that hired thousands of tutors in the United States each year to provide online tutoring from their homes or other remote locations. Under the EEOC’s proposed consent decree filed last week, the employer will pay $365,000 to the approximately 200 people who applied for a job in March and April 2020 and who were purportedly rejected because of their age.
While multiple media reports have characterized the EEOC’s iTutor lawsuit as a case involving artificial intelligence, the EEOC’s complaint only alleged that the online job application system requested dates of birth and that the application software automatically rejected female applicants age 55 or older and male applicants age 60 or older. While the EEOC’s complaint and proposed consent decree did not expressly reference artificial intelligence or machine learning, the EEOC’s press release linked the case to its recent Artificial Intelligence and Algorithmic Fairness Initiative as an example of the types of technologies that the EEOC is interested in pursuing. 
To be clear, automatically rejecting older job applicants, when their birthdates are already known, does not require any sort of artificial intelligence or machine learning. However, it is entirely fair to say that the EEOC’s complaint and positioning on the allegations squarely falls within the broader scope of its greater scrutiny of all sorts of technology in hiring, and not just “artificial intelligence.”
EEOC’s iTutor settlement provides an important reminder about how employers must continue to scrutinize their use of any technology, including those that align more closely to “algorithmic fairness,” in this rapidly developing area, given the broader context and scope of the EEOC’s ongoing efforts in this area and attendant media coverage.   
Key Takeaway
The iTutor settlement, and the EEOC’s ongoing emphasis in the area of AI and algorithmic bias, serves as a strong reminder to employers that the results of any technology-assisted screening process should comply with existing civil-rights laws. This reminder applies to both complicated and simple technology. It applies whether an employer is using cutting-edge artificial intelligence products or if its recruiters are simply setting filters on a spreadsheet. A robust compliance and risk management program should periodically evaluate how technology, both sophisticated and simple, is being used in the hiring process to ensure compliance and manage other risks.
Recent Settlements and Enforcement Actions Reach More Than Just Artificial Intelligence
The EEOC's complaint against iTutor focused on the employer’s alleged use of straightforward technology in the context of hiring and job applications. While few employers would characterize the basic technology used by iTutor as “artificial intelligence,” the alleged conduct unquestionably falls into a broader category of violations of existing civil rights laws enabled by technology. The EEOC’s scrutiny of application tracking systems follows similar settlements involving employers using these systems in ways that allegedly violated existing civil-rights laws.
In 2022 and 2023, the US Department of Justice Civil Rights Division’s Immigrant and Employee Rights Section (“IER”) reached settlements with 30 employers, assessing combined civil penalties of over $1.6 million, over the employers’ use of a college recruiting platform operated by the Georgia Institute of Technology (“Georgia Tech”). The first complaint to IER was by a student who was a lawful permanent resident, who observed that an employer’s paid internship posting on the platform was available only to U.S. citizens. IER’s subsequent investigation identified dozens more facially discriminatory postings on the site. IER’s announcement of the settlement confirmed that the website allowed employers to post job advertisements that deterred qualified students from applying for jobs because of their citizenship status, and in many cases also blocked otherwise eligible students from applying, all in violation of the immigration law.
Similarly, on March 20, 2023, the EEOC announced a settlement with a job search website operator. The underlying charge alleged that the website’s customers were posting job ads that discouraged US citizens from applying. The EEOC’s conciliation agreement required the website operator to “scrape” the website for potentially discriminatory keywords such as “OPT”, “H1B” or “Visa” that appeared near the words “only” or “must” in new job postings, in an effort to prevent discriminatory job postings. In other words, the EEOC’s conciliation agreement required the operator to implement a simple keyword filter in an effort to identify potentially discriminatory job postings.
While none of these examples above involve the use of any artificial intelligence, like the EEOC’s iTutor settlement, they unquestionably fall under the broader umbrella of “algorithmic fairness.” In October 2021, EEOC Chair Charlotte Burrows announced the EEOC’s “Artificial Intelligence and Algorithmic Fairness Initiative”. Her joint statement of April 25, 2023, joined by the heads of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Trade Commission, and Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, emphasizes the agencies’ concern about “harmful uses of automated systems”, not just artificial intelligence. And the EEOC’s draft Strategic Enforcement Plan, published in the Federal Register on January 10, 2023, indicates an enforcement focus on all “automated systems” used in hiring, not just systems that could be characterized as “artificial intelligence”.
Unquestionably, many employers are already using (and others are contemplating using) artificial intelligence as part of their hiring and other HR processes. The EEOC’s iTutor complaint, combined with its ongoing focus and outreach in this area, means that employers’ use of any technology, and not just technology characterized as “artificial intelligence,” is receiving increased scrutiny.
Whether or not technology is properly characterized as “artificial intelligence,” asserting, “The technology forced me to discriminate” will never be an effective affirmative defense to an EEOC charge or lawsuit. The EEOC’s iTutor settlement should serve as a reminder that a robust compliance and risk management program should periodically assess and test compliance and other risks regarding how technology, both sophisticated and simple, is being used in the hiring process.  Given the attention that technologies are receiving from the EEOC and other agencies, we anticipate seeing a significant rise in charge filings, investigations and litigation relating to these issues.

Addendum
The EEOC's September 11, 2023 press release announcing the iTutor settlement does not characterize the iTutor case as involving artificial intelligence or algorithmic bias. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While AI has led to job losses for many, those skilled in this field have a chance at well-paying positions. If they are good enough, they can earn as much as $900,000 annually, which is around Rs 7 crore per annum. The AI-based roles are available in the US for now.Netflix has advertised a job for a machine-learning platform product manager on its website. This role involves defining the strategic direction for the Machine Learning Platform and assessing its success. The job, which can be done from an office in California or remotely on the West Coast, offers a salary ranging from $300,000 to $900,000 per year, and a college degree is not required.Amazon is also actively seeking skilled individuals in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). To do this, they have recently advertised a job opportunity for the position of senior manager specializing in applied science and generative AI.In this role, the selected individual would be entrusted with a significant level of responsibility. They would lead a team of experts in scientific research and the application of AI techniques. Specifically, their focus areas would encompass computer vision, which involves teaching computers to interpret visual information much like humans do, and generative imagery and videos, which involves creating new visual content using AI algorithms.The role is not only intellectually engaging but also financially rewarding. While the base salary offered could go as high as $340,300 per year, it&#039;s important to note that this figure excludes any potential bonuses, which could further enhance the total compensation package.AI has become crucial in various industries, leading to a growing demand for experts in this field. Netflix and Amazon are offering salaries that place candidates in the top 1 per cent of earners in the United States.
