Escher's artwork was an inspiration for Douglas Hofstadter's 1979 book ""Gödel, Escher, Bach: An ... [+] Eternal Golden Braid"", sometimes referred to as the Bible of artificial intelligence.M.C. Escher
The field of artificial intelligence has never been the subject of more attention and analysis than it is today. Almost every week, it seems, a new bestselling book comes out examining the technology, business or ethics of AI.


Yet few of the topics and debates at the center of today's AI discourse are new. While not always recognized by commentators, artificial intelligence as a serious academic discipline dates back to the 1950s. For well over half a century, many of the world's leading minds have devoted themselves to the pursuit of machine intelligence and have grappled with what it would mean to succeed in that pursuit.

Much of the public discourse around AI in 2019 has been anticipated—and influenced—by AI thought leaders going back decades.

Below is a selection of seven classic books about intelligence: what it is, how we might build machines that have it, and what that would mean for society. These books have played a formative role in the development of the field of AI; their influence continues to be felt today. For anyone seeking a deep understanding of AI's complexities, challenges, and possibilities, they are essential reading.

PROMOTED

Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid (Douglas Hofstadter, 1979)
Gödel, Escher, Bach is sometimes referred to as “the Bible of artificial intelligence” (though Hofstadter himself rejects the label).
The book's central theme is that, through self-reference and “strange loops”, systems comprised of independently meaningless elements can acquire meaning and intelligence. Hofstader identifies versions of such recursive systems in fields as diverse as mathematics, music, art and computer science.

To sketch out his subtle thesis, Hofstadter takes his reader into the depths of number theory, classical music and the computing technology stack; he employs fanciful dialogues between fictional characters in the style of Lewis Carroll; he structures the book’s chapters, paragraphs and sentences to themselves embody his points about recursion.

The Society of Mind (Marvin Minsky, 1986)
Marvin Minsky is one of the founding fathers of artificial intelligence. In The Society of Mind, his most famous and readable work, he lays out his perspectives on how the human mind works and how we might build machines that simulate it.
Minsky's overarching thesis is that the human mind is not one coherent entity but rather a society of countless smaller “agents”, each devoted to a narrow set of tasks, functioning in synchrony to produce intelligent behavior.
Mirroring this thesis, the book is structured as 270 one-page essays. Each essay is a piece of the puzzle; as the reader progresses through the book, Minsky’s overall theory of mind emerges.
“What magical trick makes us intelligent?” he writes at the end of the book. “The trick is that there is no trick. The power of intelligence stems from our vast diversity, not from any single, perfect principle.”

On Intelligence (Jeff Hawkins, 2004)
In On Intelligence, Jeff Hawkins posits that a single fundamental “algorithm” underlies all information processing in the human brain: a feedforward mechanism that predicts future states.
Hawkins’ theory of intelligence has been highly influential across neuroscience, machine learning and philosophy over the past 15 years. It has also been regularly criticized. In 2005 Hawkins founded the AI startup Numenta with Dileep George to pursue these principles.

Alan Turing: The Enigma (Andrew Hodges, 1983)
It is only a slight overstatement to say that Alan Turing created the computer and the field of artificial intelligence. His seminal 1936 paper, vastly ahead of its time, laid the conceptual groundwork for the entire field of digital computing. He was one of the first thinkers to take the idea of artificial intelligence seriously. His 1950 paper—which famously opens with the line “I propose to consider the question, ‘Can machines think?’”—introduced the Turing Test, which remains a touchstone in the AI literature today.
Andrew Hodges’ 1983 work is the authoritative biography of Turing's life. Prior to its publication, Turing's accomplishments were not widely known, due largely to the total secrecy that for decades surrounded his wartime work on cryptography for the Allies at Bletchley Park. Hodges’ book played a pivotal role in bringing Turing’s ideas to light and establishing him at the forefront of the pantheon of machine intelligence pioneers.
On the topic of AI, Turing made it clear where he stood. Generations ahead of his time, in words that would still be provocative today, Turing wrote in 1951: “It is customary to offer a grain of comfort, in the form of a statement that some peculiarly human characteristic could never be imitated by a machine. I cannot offer any such comfort, for I believe that no such bounds can be set.”

The Singularity is Near (Ray Kurzweil, 2005)
Perhaps no book or author presents a more relentlessly optimistic view of our technological future than Ray Kurzweil's The Singularity Is Near.
Grounding his arguments in the concepts of exponential growth and accelerating returns, Kurzweil anticipates a future in which runaway machine intelligence transforms everything about the world as we know it. He predicts this superintelligence will enable us to control our own genetics, master nanotechnology, and manipulate physical matter at will. Eventually, human and non-human intelligence will merge, transcend biology, and spread throughout the universe.
While his conclusions are startling, his approach is meticulously data-driven. As the New York Times put it, “Kurzweil's vision of our super-enhanced future is completely sane and calmly reasoned.”
The concept of the Singularity has inspired generations of technologists; it has also garnered plenty of ridicule for its fantastical, utopian overtones. Kurzweil did not invent the idea (credit goes to the legendary John von Neumann in the 1950s), but he and this book have played a major role in popularizing it.

Descartes' Error: Emotion, Reason, and the Human Brain (Antonio Damasio, 1994)
Conventional wisdom has long held that, while the intellect is logic-based and objective, emotions make us irrational and cloud our judgment.
In Descartes’ Error, neurologist Antonio Damasio famously reconceptualized the relationship between emotion and intellect. The book argues that emotions in fact play an essential role in cognition and decision-making, and that without them our intellectual capabilities would not be possible.
This theory of intelligence has intriguing implications for AI. As Marvin Minsky once put it: “The question is not whether intelligent machines can have any emotions, but whether machines can be intelligent without any emotions.”

The Mind's I (Douglas Hofstadter and Daniel Dennett, 1981)
In The Mind's I, Hofstadter and Dennett undertake to examine the most fundamental of questions: what is thought, what is consciousness and what is the mind? They do so through an annotated anthology of pieces from contributors as diverse as Richard Dawkins, Jorge Luis Borges and Alan Turing.
The book contains rich insights about what it would mean for a machine to think, interweaving perspectives from psychology, engineering, philosophy and literature. But don’t expect to walk away with any straightforward answers. As they write in the preface: “We believe there are at present no easy answers to the big questions. This book, then, is designed to provoke, disturb, and befuddle its readers.”

Anne Carpenter is an Institute Scientist and Merkin Institute Fellow at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT. Her research group develops algorithms and data analysis methods for large-scale experiments involving images. The team’s open-source CellProfiler software is used by thousands of biologists worldwide (www.cellprofiler.org). Carpenter is a pioneer in image-based profiling, the extraction of rich, unbiased information from images for a number of important applications in drug discovery and functional genomics. Carpenter focused on high-throughput image analysis during her postdoctoral fellowship at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research and MIT’s CSAIL (Computer Sciences/Artificial Intelligence Laboratory). Her PhD is in cell biology from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. Carpenter has been named an NSF CAREER awardee, an NIH MIRA awardee, a Massachusetts Academy of Sciences fellow (its youngest at the time), and a Genome Technology “Rising Young Investigator”. Anne Carpenter Can you tell us a bit about yourself and your institution? My name is Anne Carpenter and I am at the Broad Institute of Harvardand MIT(MA, USA). The Broad is a nonprofit academic institution that focuses on technology and collaboration. This means that we have a lot of software engineers, high-throughput screening instrumentation and collaborations among interdisciplinary scientists, which allows us to take on projects that are larger scale than that of a typical individual or academic lab. Can you tell us about your presentation coming up on Sunday? I will be focusing on several really interesting biological stories where we have uncovered more in images than biologists would have expected. For example, it’s difficult to tell what stage of the cell cycle cells are in when looking at bright-field images. Aside from some very obvious telophase, you generally can’t tell whether the cell is in G1 or G2 and whether it’s duplicated DNA or not. We discovered that if you take the bright-field and dark-field images of unlabeled cells, there is sufficient information to predict the amount of DNA that each cell has as well as some phases of mitosis. We can also tell the difference between a cell that’s in G1 versus G2 versus prophase versus metaphase and onward. This was pretty unexpected at the time. Originally, we did the experiment with classical machine learning. Then we subsequently did it with deep learning, to provide greater resolution. Now, we are going to test all kinds of different disease scenarios to see if this is true across the board. We want to look at whether we can detect for example leukemia in unlabeled cells. Leukemia is an example where, typically, pathologists are required to use specific antibodies that label specific biomarkers. It took years to figure out which biomarkers you label in order to tell whether a patient’s leukemia is responding to chemotherapy or not. Now we have this, we need to use these antibodies to label the cells, and these panels can be anywhere from four to ten different antibodies. Once again, we discovered that if you just look at the bright-field and dark-field images alone, the cell’s internal structure is telling you enough about its state that we can distinguish leukemic cells from non-leukemic.  New AI tech launched to drive drug discovery Artificial intelligence set to revolutionize cell imaging methods New technology provides insight into cell communication  Can you tell us a bit more about the machine- and deep-learning techniques you are using to uncover this information? Deep learning is definitely causing a revolution in the computer vision field and in a lot of commercial applications, but now it’s coming to biology as well. Typically, deep learning extracts features that humans may not have considered looking for. You can look at so many different combinations of features of cells that it can go beyond what we are able to articulate and engineer an algorithm to specifically measure. Letting deep learning algorithms loose on images is an unbiased way of taking the raw image data and converting it into a feature space that can go beyond what we can see by eye. Can you tell us more about the quantification tools that you have developed in your lab? Our original tool is CellProfiler. I wrote the first version of it 16 years ago, so it’s now quite a mature project and used by thousands of biologists around the world. It’s capable of handling high throughput experiments, which is why we originally wrote it, but some of the same things that make it robust and reliable for high throughput experiments also make it very handy for small-scale experiments. In fact, the majority of our users are doing small-scale experiments, where they want to quantify the results of what they see by eye. What challenges did you encounter when developing those software tools? I’d say the biggest challenge for software for biologists is funding. People are often surprised to learn that both CellProfiler and ImageJ, which are the two most popular open-source softwares for image analysis, both only have around one software engineer working on them over the past decades. You would think there’s a team of dozens that support these projects but it’s actually quite minimal, and even that one engineer is often hard to find. I think it’s really important to consider that, for all other domains of biological software, it doesn’t take much support to keep these projects going. They pay themselves back probably a hundred-fold in terms of how much time they save all the researchers that make use of these different software packages. “I don’t think there are any fundamental stumbling blocks in this space. There are a lot of bright people who are interested in this problem, who are beginning to work on it. It’s just a matter of letting people’s research unfold because these next few years are going to be pretty exciting.” Is there any information that you think remains locked away in cell images and image data that we can’t currently access due to limitations in the software? We’re definitely just scratching the surface of what is possible to extract in images. For the most part, biologists have moved from a microscopy experiment being purely qualitative and most people do quantify the phenomena that they see. However, I would say the vast majority only quantify the phenomena they already see by eye. I think, we should be seeing a shift towards more biologists using microscopy as a data source to look for things that they can’t necessarily see, but are nevertheless robust and reproducible. Because we’re just starting to do this kind of an experiment, I suspect there are tremendous improvements that can be made in the kinds of features that are extracted. Once a computer tells you that a set of patient cell lines A is different from B, the next question that biologists have is how are they different? That’s a question that is actually a little difficult to answer at times. There are various methods of taking the results of a deep learning model and interpreting them and understanding the mechanism or the meaning of them. I think that’s a crucial area for improvement so that when the computer does find interesting and unexpected things in images, we can translate that into some kind of deeper biological understanding of the system. Beyond funding, what needs to change in the field to be able to get to that next step of interpretation of the data? I don’t think there are any fundamental stumbling blocks in this space. There are a lot of bright people who are interested in this problem, who are beginning to work on it. It’s just a matter of letting people’s research unfold because these next few years are going to be pretty exciting. “It’s best if computational advancements come from a deep biological need.” Where do you see the field heading in the next 5 years? The current version of CellProfiler, for example, uses classical image processing algorithms. We are in the middle of this transition where within a few years biologists are going to be able to drag-and-drop their images into a web app and the software will automatically recognize a variety of structures within the cell without any training or tweaking or understanding how the image processing is working. If we can train models that are generalizable enough, we should be able to get to the point where image analysis becomes quite a lot easier for the biologists. What has been the main driver in your career path? The progression of my career, transitioning from a pure cell biologist and microscopist into the computational field, has been primarily driven simply by following the next step for various projects that I personally was working on. In general, it’s best if computational advancements come from a deep biological need. I would say that probably defines my career progression up until now. Do you have any advice for early career researchers starting out in a similar field? I think as you’re developing in your career, it’s great if you can identify an area that is underpopulated, is useful to your research and really makes you excited. I think following the combination of the biological need and your interest level can lead you to create a vision of the future that you can then pursue for many decades.","[{'@type': 'Article', '@id': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/lab-design-machinery/anne-carpenter-on-artificial-intelligence-in-the-cell-imaging-field/#article', 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/lab-design-machinery/anne-carpenter-on-artificial-intelligence-in-the-cell-imaging-field/'}, 'author': {'name': 'Tristan Free', '@id': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/#/schema/person/4ee087aaf9a5736b165aec787f89af84'}, 'headline': 'Anne Carpenter on artificial intelligence in the cell imaging field', 'datePublished': '2019-12-23T09:00:49+00:00', 'dateModified': '2020-08-14T14:42:58+00:00', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@id': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/lab-design-machinery/anne-carpenter-on-artificial-intelligence-in-the-cell-imaging-field/'}, 'wordCount': 1614, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/#organization'}, 'image': {'@id': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/lab-design-machinery/anne-carpenter-on-artificial-intelligence-in-the-cell-imaging-field/#primaryimage'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mitotic-LLC-PK1-cells-fluorescence-microscopy-1.jpg', 'keywords': ['AI', 'ASCB 2019', 'cell imaging', 'Deep learning', 'machine learning', 'Software'], 'articleSection': ['Lab design and machinery'], 'inLanguage': 'en-GB'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/lab-design-machinery/anne-carpenter-on-artificial-intelligence-in-the-cell-imaging-field/', 'url': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/lab-design-machinery/anne-carpenter-on-artificial-intelligence-in-the-cell-imaging-field/', 'name': 'Advances in Cell Imaging Software with Anne Carpenter - BioTechniques', 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/#website'}, 'primaryImageOfPage': {'@id': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/lab-design-machinery/anne-carpenter-on-artificial-intelligence-in-the-cell-imaging-field/#primaryimage'}, 'image': {'@id': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/lab-design-machinery/anne-carpenter-on-artificial-intelligence-in-the-cell-imaging-field/#primaryimage'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mitotic-LLC-PK1-cells-fluorescence-microscopy-1.jpg', 'datePublished': '2019-12-23T09:00:49+00:00', 'dateModified': '2020-08-14T14:42:58+00:00', 'description': 'Computational microscopist Anne Carpenter discusses how artificial intelligence is changing cell imaging software and what to expect in the near future.', 'breadcrumb': {'@id': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/lab-design-machinery/anne-carpenter-on-artificial-intelligence-in-the-cell-imaging-field/#breadcrumb'}, 'inLanguage': 'en-GB', 'potentialAction': [{'@type': 'ReadAction', 'target': ['https://www.biotechniques.com/lab-design-machinery/anne-carpenter-on-artificial-intelligence-in-the-cell-imaging-field/']}]}, {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'inLanguage': 'en-GB', '@id': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/lab-design-machinery/anne-carpenter-on-artificial-intelligence-in-the-cell-imaging-field/#primaryimage', 'url': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mitotic-LLC-PK1-cells-fluorescence-microscopy-1.jpg', 'contentUrl': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mitotic-LLC-PK1-cells-fluorescence-microscopy-1.jpg', 'width': 840, 'height': 350}, {'@type': 'BreadcrumbList', '@id': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/lab-design-machinery/anne-carpenter-on-artificial-intelligence-in-the-cell-imaging-field/#breadcrumb', 'itemListElement': [{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Home', 'item': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Anne Carpenter on artificial intelligence in the cell imaging field'}]}, {'@type': 'WebSite', '@id': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/#website', 'url': 'https://www.biotechniques.com/', 'name': 'BioTechniques', 'description': 'Powered by Taylor &amp;

“We want our professionals to have a great experience at work,” says Bigelow, who left the company earlier this month. “Sometimes their experience outside of work, as consumers, is better than when they’re performing tasks, collaborating and analyzing on the job.”
B&V field service technicians travel to remote locations to perform and carefully document inspections, installations, maintenance or repairs on telecommunications and industrial equipment. The company’s injection of automation and artificial intelligence into its techs’ mobile work processes is helping them perform that work more efficiently.
 
 
 













 
 

AI fuels field service work
Figuring out ways to empower B&V technicians in the field falls to David Simmons, senior director of innovation and technology for B&V’s telecommunications unit. To facilitate this effort, Simmons has installed mobile software that pushes detailed information about designs, repairs and other content onto technicians’ smartphones.

Barbie Bigelow, former CIO, Black & Veatch

Dozens of applications provide similar capabilities, but Simmons says software he selected from startup Zinier automatically routes work order assignments, change orders and recordkeeping, creating a communications loop between the B&V’s back-office and front-office operations and the field. By pairing machine learning algorithms with historical data, Zinier anticipates when machines are likely to break down and recommends that B&V deploy technicians to fix them, Simmons says.
Adopting Zinier is part of B&V’s drive to get out in front of 5G, which will deliver faster data transfer speeds at lower latency, ushering a new wave of ubiquitous internet connectivity. But 5G requires major equipment upgrades to existing macro sites, as well as increased capacity using densification with small cells and oDAS (outdoor distributive antenna system) networks.
 
 
 













 
 

Out of the box, Zinier’s algorithms look for certain traits or characteristics, but they also learn from data generated daily by B&V’s operations, as well as from B&V worker feedback when they accept or reject its recommendations. “It takes in all these inputs to figure out the best parts of a workflow to automate, all depending on the use case the customer has configured,” says Arka Dhar, co-founder and CEO at Zinier, adding that customers can pick the algorithm and set data parameters.

Auto-generating work orders and repairs
Examples include auto-generating requests for building permits and work orders, and triggering updates to these requests on the fly. The software also automatically recognizes potential breaches of work order service-level agreements and adjusts schedules to address these issues. It can also auto-generate parts transfers when parts are low in trucks.

David Simmons, Senior Director of Innovation and Technology, Black & Veatch

Previously, much of this work was done via phone or in the flesh, with workers traveling across town to pick up building permits and other documents and checking and entering data on laptops they’d lug around in their trucks, Simmons says. Now the work orders are generated via an application on a smartphone in the technician’s pocket.
 
 
 













 
 

“Many offerings provide a sleek way to get data on a phone, but we ultimately chose Zinier because they stacked their technology atop algorithms for crowdsourcing the data,” Simmons tells CIO.com. “The differentiator is in getting data from upstream through intelligent automation into the hands of the field person.”
This appears to be the prevailing strategy for field service work. By 2022, over 50 percent of field service providers will offer a digital customer experience that enables two-way interaction and workflow initiation via multiple human and nonhuman channels, according to research Gartner published in December. AI will increasingly guide these digital services, according to Gartner, which expects that 30 percent of software vendors serving the field service market will infuse their platforms with AI by 2022.
Bigelow likens the Zinier technology to how Uber empowers its drivers with mobile software and analytics to serve their passengers. And she adds that B&V’s staff has embraced the company’s growing adoption of emerging technologies — which also includes exploring robotic process automation (RPA) and autonomous vehicles to lay fiber at construction sites — to foster a more service-oriented culture.
 
 
 













 
 

“We want to be proactive about the future of work because this is where things are headed,” Bigelow says. “The more tech savvy our workforce is, the better positioned our workforce is.”

higihigi
Jeff Bennett, CEO of higi, is working to keep connections strong between the health-tracking, data-focused kiosks they provide and their users. Bennett said user feedback influences whether the company chooses to adopt a new technology.
 
What does the future of healthcare technology look like, and what technologies are helping to drive the industry’s evolution?
Consumer demand for affordable, accessible care at current or improved levels of quality is the driving force in the evolution of healthcare and the technologies behind it. 
To win, companies have to think of the consumer first and foremost, and build infrastructure to exceed their expectations across every facet of their experience. They should ultimately connect consumers to the healthcare resources and partners they care about in a way that feels seamless and modern. 
 

""Companies have to think of the consumer first and foremost...”

 
How do you ensure your company stays on the cutting-edge of healthtech? What new technologies or products are you incorporating into your work?
Everything we do starts by establishing how we are working in service of the millions of consumers who engage with our tech each month, and how that experience makes it easier for our users to engage with trusted healthcare organizations. Whether we partner with a new technology or develop our own, we prioritize how that new feature or functionality will better enable our users to engage with us, and in turn, with their health and healthcare partners.
 
outcome healthOutcome Health
Outcome Health provides patients and physicians with educational content on interactive devices for the point of care space. With their offerings coming at such a critical time within the healthcare journey, CEO Matt McNally said it’s important that patients and caregivers feel the technology they’re engaging with suits their situational needs.
To that end, the company is investing in technologies requested by their end-users: think more mobile integrations for patients and voice activation capabilities for physicians.
 
What does the future of healthcare technology look like, and what technologies are helping to drive the industry’s evolution?
The future of healthcare technology, and more specifically the point-of-care space, must align with the needs of patients and physicians. We recently conducted extensive research to understand these needs. We discovered that patients, nurses and physicians all want more personalization and to feel like the technology they’re engaging with is empathetic to their unique experience. We’re using this research to guide our point-of-care content offering and the devices used to deliver information so that we can create an improved experience for the audience.
 

""We are committed to building tech that complements, not distracts.”

 
How do you ensure your company stays on the cutting-edge of healthtech? What new technologies or products are you incorporating into your work?
Everything that we do is in service to patients. We’re not trying to keep up with the latest trends in tech, we’d rather keep up with what patients need. 
Regarding new technologies, we are looking at voice activation in certain categories. We’ve received feedback from our physician partners that, oftentimes, they don’t want to leave the side of their patients when delivering certain news, but they do want to pull up models on products like our Exam Room Wallboard, which may be on an opposite wall. With voice activation, they can still be next to their patients and use our devices to support the conversation. 
We are committed to building tech that complements, not distracts. With the rise of telemedicine, we’re starting to think about how to innovate beyond patient rooms so that Outcome Health can be with patients on their mobile devices when they’re outside of their doctor’s office.

Pager’s technology platform enables clinicians with superpowers to provide their patients with better access through virtual care, after-care follow-up and a personalized care experience; just like having a doctor in the family.
 

Zipari
Advances in machine learning and healthcare have come a long way. But according to David Levy, SVP of product engineering at Zipari, this is just the beginning.
Zipari simplifies the health insurance relationship between carriers and customers and offers a CRM Salesforce integration. 
 
What does the future of healthcare technology look like? What technologies specifically are driving the industry’s evolution?
It’s well accepted that the future of healthcare technology is in machine learning. What’s most interesting is where the data will come from. Wearables and smart devices are becoming ubiquitous, creating a wealth of new and powerful health insights.
The Internet of Things has already made a recognized impact on the cost and longevity of industrial equipment across sectors. By leveraging low-cost, low-power, interconnected sensors and continuous monitoring to understand normal and anomalous operation, it’s possible to detect and address problems much earlier; avoiding costly or even dangerous situations.
It’s just a matter of time before we see a flashpoint in healthcare where these devices become the norm, people become more engaged in the impact of their lifestyle on their bodies and minds, and new healthcare standards emerge.
 

""It’s well accepted that the future of healthcare technology is in machine learning.’’

 
How do you ensure your company stays on the cutting-edge of healthtech? What new technologies or products are you incorporating into your work?
Zipari stays on the cutting edge of healthtech because we love technology. For me, unending research is just a part of my life, whether through conferences, online publications or even better, getting my hands on something new (like a 3D printer to demonstrate prosthetics applications for fun).
In such a highly regulated field, we often have technology solutions well before we can leverage them for health consumers. A good example is cloud services. While we await regulatory advances, we stay on top of emerging standards and demand by networking with colleagues and customers. 
 
amplicareAmplicare
People like monogrammed mugs and pillows for a reason: personalization makes us feel important. The same is true for healthcare. Although, of course, a bit more is at stake.
CFO and Co-Founder Nathan Shanor recently told us how Amplicare, a decision-automation platform, personalizes their offerings so that pharmacies and patients alike see better results. 
 
What does the future of healthcare technology look like? What technologies specifically are driving the industry’s evolution?
Convenience and personalization will continue to drive the development of technologies that change the industry. Consumers want to be able to access their health information on demand. On top of this, only 12 percent of adults have proficient health literacy, so information must be digestible. We’re already seeing an increase in patients leveraging virtual assistant technologies, such as Alexa and Siri, for healthcare needs; be it finding a clinic or scheduling a physical doctor’s appointment or a digital visit via telemedicine.
On the pharmacy front, eCare (a documentation and communication process) will likely become more commonplace. It provides practitioners with a more robust picture of a patient’s health. Having access to this data will further improve the personalization of care.
 

""Convenience and personalization will continue to drive the development of technologies that change the industry.’’ 

 
How do you ensure your company stays on the cutting edge of healthtech? What new technologies or products are you incorporating into your work?
We constantly receive feedback from our customers and keep a close eye on industry trends. Our flagship product Amplicare Match (formerly iMedicare) has evolved from being a reactive product that pharmacists would use when patients came in asking for Medicare Part D comparisons to a proactive one.
We now run millions of plan comparisons and identify patients most in need so pharmacies can target them for consultations. This saves their staff time and ensures maximum prescription drug savings for patients. We also created a patient-facing site to help users access this information from the convenience of their homes.
In the past few years, we have added more capabilities to our platform to address other aspects of care, such as nutrient depletion, immunizations, prescription adherence and patient communications. We partner with companies doing incredible work to provide pharmacies and patients an all-encompassing perspective of patient care. As we look toward the future, we will continue to enhance our solutions to be as convenient and personalized as possible.

Every sector has an eye toward better patient outcomes at a better cost-to-value ratio. As these entities work to navigate this new business of healthcare, they are looking for technology infrastructures that support two overarching themes.
 
The first theme is supporting the consumerization of healthcare. Technology needs to drive convenience and transparency for patients. 
The second theme is driving the insights necessary to power data-driven decisions. As organizations evolve, expand and adapt, healthcare leaders need to know what’s working and what’s not across the continuum of care. Technology platforms must support the capture and analysis of data, plus the coordination and execution of changes in the business of healthcare. To support these needs, we are seeing organizations focus on mobile applications, seek faster insights from artificial intelligence and work to gain efficiency from machine learning and robotic process automation.
 

""We are exploring blockchain as a foundational technology...”

 
How do you ensure your company stays on the cutting-edge of healthtech? What new technologies or products are you incorporating into your work?
At GHX we are incorporating data science, machine learning and AI into our solutions to create scale, efficiency and drive the insights our customers need to operate in the new business of healthcare. We are exploring blockchain as a foundational technology that can support the demands facing our customers today and tomorrow.
 
SimplePracticeSimplePractice
SimplePractice provides health and wellness professionals with a platform that allows them to manage their patient networks more effectively. 
CEO and Co-founder Howard Spector discussed the importance of patients having seamless access to care, and said that implementing new mobile video communication is an increasingly viable way to do that. 
 
What does the future of healthcare technology look like? What technologies specifically are driving the industry’s evolution?
I think the easier we can make access to information for professionals and their patients, the better. This can mean things like moving away from manual data-sharing between providers and moving toward patient access via a secure client portal and mobile apps. 
Another important way technology is allowing better access is through telehealth. Using secure video technology allows people who live in rural areas to get help. It also provides continuity of care when circumstances arise that make it hard for individuals to see a professional.
 

""We never settle.”

 
How do you ensure your company stays on the cutting-edge of healthtech? What new technologies or products are you incorporating into your work?
There is always more we can do to make our platform and services better for our customers. We never settle, and we work intentionally to have productive communication with our engaged community of customers to keep us on the right path. So while 'new' is important, it’s just as important to make certain that even the 'old' features are doing what they need to do to best serve our customers.
 
Well healthWell Health
Well Health’s platform lets patients and their healthcare organizations communicate through text, phone, email and live-chat. 
The service makes tasks like confirming insurance and viewing lab results more efficient, and CEO Guillaume de Zwirek said the company and the industry as a whole are doubling down to produce even more patient-focused efforts. Well Health’s teams tapped into a huge pool of data to evolve the platform’s appointment scheduling tool for patients.
 
What does the future of healthcare technology look like? What technologies specifically are driving the industry’s evolution?
Healthcare is following the lead of many other industries in moving toward providing concierge-like experiences. Concierge service used to be reserved for the elite but the rise of mobile, AI, the internet of things and many other technological advances has started to level the playing field. 
For example, anyone can order a “personal driver” by calling an Uber or Lyft or benefit from a “travel planner” by texting a TripActions agent when a flight gets delayed. In healthcare, we’ll soon see things like personal device and smart-speaker data feeding back to physicians to predict disease. We’ll see prescriptions being delivered within the hour and in real-time, as well as asynchronous communication with medical teams available around the clock.
 

""Healthcare is following the lead of many other industries in moving toward providing concierge-like experiences.”

 
How do you ensure your company stays on the cutting-edge of healthtech? What new technologies or products are you incorporating into your work?
We look to our patients. Our platform processes over 150 million communications per year. This data gives us clear signals on what we should prioritize to best improve the patient experience. In a recent example, we analyzed millions of patient interactions and developed an automated self-rescheduling workflow that surfaces alternate appointment times when a patient requests to cancel or reschedule their appointment.

renew health Renew Health
CTO Leevar Williams said he’s working to help Renew Health’s engineers remain as efficient as possible as the company and industry evolve.
The leader at the prescription drug management platform said as his development team moves toward a containerized service architecture, they’re free to explore the use of new tech tools they believe will benefit their daily operations.
 
What does the future of healthcare technology look like? What technologies specifically are driving the industry’s evolution?
This is an industry where data is often fragmented and siloed within disparate systems. A lot of the transformation we’re seeing is due to companies leveraging cloud-compute and storage platforms to integrate data. They’re applying machine learning and other advanced analytics capabilities, at scale, to improve the patient experience.
 
I think the integration of real-time data streams, the broader adoption of communication standards for information exchange and automated interpretation of complex datasets will continue to drive the industry’s ability to provide better health outcomes for people.

The Defense Department’s central artificial intelligence development effort wants to build an artificial intelligence-powered drone swarm capable of independently identifying and tracking targets, and maybe even saving lives.The Pentagon’s Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, or JAIC, issued a request for information to find out if AI developers and drone swarm builders can come together to support search and rescue missions.Search and rescue operations are covered under one of the four core JAIC research areas: humanitarian aid and disaster relief. The program also works on AI solutions for predictive maintenance, cyberspace operations and robotic process automation.The goal for the RFI is to discover whether industry can deliver a full-stack search and rescue drone swarm that can self-pilot, detect humans and other targets and stream data and video back to a central location. The potential solicitation would also look for companies or teams that can provide algorithms, machine training processes and data to supplement that provided by the government.The ideal result would be a contract with several vendors “that together could provide the capability to fly to a predetermined location/area, find people and manmade objects—through onboard edge processing—and cue analysts to look at detections sent via a datalink to a control station,” according to the RFI. “Sensors shall be able to stream full motion video to an analyst station during the day or night; though, the system will not normally be streaming as the AI will be monitoring the imagery instead of a person.”The system has to have enough edge processing power to enable the AI to fly, detect and monitor without any human intervention, while also being able to stream live video to an operator and allow that human to take control of the drones, if needed.The RFI contains a number of must-haves, including:
The ability to launch from air, sea and ground.
Capable of flying for at least two hours at a minimum of 50 knots airspeed.
Air droppable from another aircraft in flight.
Able to launch and fly to a predetermined search area and follow a predetermined pattern.
Capable of searching a geo-fenced area.
Sensors able to cover at least 100 square nautical miles.
A datalink enabling continuous communication with the ground station or launch platform.
The RFI also notes all training data will be government-owned and classified. All development work will be done using government-owned data and on secure government systems.Responses to the RFI are due by 11 a.m. Jan. 20.

Artificially Intelligent Smart Robots will not take our jobs. They are like elevators, the once smart robots, which carry people floor to floor and only boosted skyscrapers density.

The Proof: Hundred years ago any car of the period was nothing but the smartest robot boosted by the artificial intelligence of the combustion engine on how and when to spark, ignite and consume energy to achieve transportable mobility. Assisted by a driver, the mobility over century has now brought us to a critical crossroad; half of the world, confused with a smart phone in one hand as the most powerful and lowest priced robotic-device ever made by mankind and other entrapments of audio-video-augmented-virtual-reality giving us levitation in real time is now fearful. Now almost brainwashed and mesmerized most of us with tik-tok-controlled sensibility of time and tempo, shake in fear of the arrival of artificial-intelligence to come and take over our jobs, control our lives, steal our money, take way our children and runaway with our loved ones while some creep in our dimly lit bedrooms.
Hey Google, call a Robocop…
Total Nonsense: as Zombie-Nations are perpetually dead now Robot-Nations start invading our cinematically matured psyche, the Hollywood and Bollywood of sorts of the world are all freaked, stuffed and snuffed up on AI mythology… media of the world on such mumbling nonsense to allow vaporization of more fake news added to the mist of confusion.
Five ways to avoid AI nightmares
Start thinking how to achieve mastery over yourself and robots
Start deep study on critical thinking, new major changes and self-discovery
Start discovering independently available entrepreneurialism and lifelong learning
Stop the ignorant talk about how machines overtakes humans
Stop whatever keeps you very busy today for being not important or any value
Artificial Intelligence is nothing but man-made advanced programming. All designed by super-geniuses of our times, with smart algorithmic programming to work with sensory devices mesmerize human emotions. There is no such thing as man-made human-intelligence or artificially created intelligence of any kind to overtake humans. A robot crawling like a spider still 1,000 years away from making a web, unless pre-programmed with supplied strings and pre-selected-pattern. The world of today is half-subdued by the Hollywood fiction of Artificial Intelligence and other half-intoxicated by stock market over evaluations of any high tech innovation that move sideways. The race to achieve supremacy of artificial intelligence among nations getting tight, the Quantum Supremacy was a highly positive global news item. Simple, supreme smart performance by extremely smart machines promoted just like suntan lotion is nothing but Artificial Ignorance to fool masses and manipulate with Sci-Fi horror branding and stock-market sloganeering.
Artificially Intelligent Smart Robots will not take our jobs, because just like the elevators the once smart robots to carry people floor to floor only boosted skyscrapers density and brought massive automation to city cores of the world. Million other gadgets during last century from fork-lifts to train or even table clock to make sure we show up on exact time and not sometime before sunset.
Naseem Javed
Fact Check:
Can AI think like human?  No.
Can AI pretend to think like human? Yes
Let’s make a collect call to AI
What will steal our jobs is not Artificial Intelligence but Artificial Ignorance: our own mind and its own untapped supremacy of performance, like when our imagination a free flying out of control part of our brain, loves drifting, comfortable and lazy as couch-potato craves ghoulish ideas easily surrenders and allows overtaken by AI type notions, while on the other side suppressing logic and critical thinking the real hard working and treadmill exercising parts of the brain getting rusty failing to fully understand the new landscapes, battlefields unable to decipher intelligent advancements moves.
Deep processes of personal-self-discovery are essential to fully understand although living in highly technologically advanced society we still trapped in our basic human emotions and still not that much evolved. We crave for wild happiness even at mortality as costs, sadness drags us into oblivion, fear makes us shut down exploring new options, anger slowly destroys us…like babes in the woods we walk with curiosity but with trepidations and fears, excited with fireflies and cry at sunsets. There lies the facts that can only discovered with self-optimization via self-discoveries and lifelong learning, where the last decades made such discussions taboo in institutions of learning. We burdened with knowledge as slaves to serve markets but not enough to uplift our own self-discovery pointing to our own adventurous paths into the future. We now face issues of our own survival of new kind; where elevators to higher floors are less important over mind capable for achieving higher level understanding and deal with a complex world.
The dawn of critical thinking and emotional intelligence is around the corner.
For now, let obesity dance to slim-fits, let Viagra-sunrises have their climaxes, let cannabis high afternoons miss the clock, let Opioid-nights gasp under the red moons, let freedom of speech ring a bit longer, let technology advance to newer height…all but never allow fears, let’s have widely awaken nights on the advancements of artificial ignorance and worry more about the future confusion and recognize silence as sign of lack of strategy and solutions. Seek answers
FACTS:  The future is much brighter with technology and smart algorithms. Smart programming and automation will eliminate advanced while collar jobs around the world. A billion misplaced need immediate shift in course of rediscovery as their degrees will no longer shield them, it will be independent critical thinking, emotional intelligence and entrepreneurialism. Smart nations have real opportunities to do something manageable right now before this turns into restless citizenry embracing populism. Nations must decide, either to invest in riot-gears or invest in lifelong learning and national mobilization of entrepreneurialism. For a short while more, we will see life altering changes on global scale, the five billion connected Alpha Dreamers will change the world, a new sense of urgency will appear.
One more time, mankind will end-up against the wall; face the crisis and turn around as always survived calamites and tyrannies of sorts; this is just another such turn, now starved for nouveau-human-intelligence. This is when life-long learning and national mobilization of entrepreneurialism on platform economies will become mandatory as national survival strategy. 
An amazing futurism awaits for change savvy critical thinkers. 
A Very Happy New Year!

Through the use of robots and software agents, the machine may even perform these tasks alone or as a team member collaborating with humans. If we are going to build machines that play roles that simulate human reasoning, behaviour and activities, as a society we should ensure that those machines benefit all members of society, regardless of their age, gender, religion or status in society, rather than replicate human biases, perpetuate disparities or widen the gap between the haves and have nots.If AI is a simulation of human intelligence, who does it simulate and does it have a gender? Whether you view gender as socially constructed by one’s environment and culture, a biologically determined factor as in the essentialist perspective, or adhere to the theory of individual differences, gender plays a role in who we are.All too often it affects how we are perceived and what we can do. That can vary from opportunities to pursue a certain career to whether our car navigation system recognises or ignores our voice commands.In my area of AI research, female avatars are most commonly used to play virtual assistants and companions. This perpetuates a perspective that helping roles are best performed by women.These characters are friendly and empathic, but also submissive and there are no negative consequences for users who ignore them or even verbally abusive them. But more often AI represents males.I recall earlier this year at a Digital Health conference in Melbourne a medical specialist confessing that 25 years ago when he was a rural GP he misdiagnosed a female patient which nearly cost her life because he had never seen that condition in a female.The dataset he was operating from, his experience, was biased. Similarly, the bias within AI is due to the inherent bias in our world.It exists in the expertise we capture in knowledge based systems, in the datasets from which we develop predictive models and the software and hardware designed for and tested by (mostly) men who naturally operate from their own experiences and needs. To make matters worse, because the AI is doing the task, the bias becomes more hidden, particularly in methods like deep learning that are difficult for humans to interpret or understand.In order for AI technology to meet the needs of both men and women, both genders should be the target of innovation ns, involved in the design of these systems and represented in datasets and evaluations. For example, we need to avoid unconscious bias in deciding what features to include or exclude in the training of predictive models. But how can we deliver inclusive solutions given current gender gaps?Globally, women are underrepresented in Engineering and Information Technology classrooms and workplaces, with representation around 30% in India and significantly lower in other countries ; resulting in products and technology mostly designed with men in mind.In AI research, that percentage is closer to 10%, as I observed in 2018 at the joint-AI conference held in Stockholm with thousands of delegates, where I and another lady had the rare experience of walking straight into a toilet cubicle following the keynote speeches and watched with some amusement the long and winding queue emanating from the men’s bathroom.Governments, universities, industry and wider society need to work together to develop ethical frameworks that harness the benefits of AI without ignoring concerns such as cognitive degeneration, threats to autonomy, accountability, privacy, security, discrimination, societal implications and economic impacts.Five key principles found across existing frameworks mandate that AI technology should benefit the common good (beneficence); do no harm (non-maleficence); maintain human agency (autonomy); promote diversity and fairness (justice) and to ensure accountability, responsibility and transparency (explicability) with respect to the other principles.Particularly relevant to the gender question, the principle of justice aims to eliminate discrimination, minimise data bias and promote shared benefits.So back to our question. Does AI represent or favour a particular gender? Yes, currently it mirrors our world dominated by data, decisions and designs for and by males.Explainable AI, AI that can explain its goals, beliefs, reasoning and knowledge boundaries, provides a fresh opportunity to make this bias transparent.To bring the female voice to AI is another key solution that can be achieved through initiatives such as the women in STEM programs at Macquarie University situated in Sydney, Australia. With commitment to follow ethical principles, together we can build AI that exposes bias and does not discriminate based on gender; in so doing artificial intelligence can transform human intelligence and our society.(The author is Professor, Department of Computing Faculty of Science and Engineering, Macquarie University.
