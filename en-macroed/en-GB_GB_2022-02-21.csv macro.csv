Artificial Intelligence is becoming a common topic of discussion in most occupation circles. We’ve heard many negatives and dire predictions about possible and probably job losses, but the facts are few and not easy to understand. Pierce Ivory, Marketing Director at Advance SystemsOpens a new window , explains how artificial intelligence will affect our careers, our work, and our economic outcomes
Your Opinion? Doesn’t Really Matter
Most of us have opinions as to whether Artificial Intelligence(AI) will ‘’make or break’’ us. This is especially true in the tech and policy arenas.
One side of the opinions declares that many or most of us will be out of jobs when Artificial Intelligence becomes smart enough to take over jobs.
The second side opinion declares that Artificial Intelligence will likely do away with many of the boring, redundant jobs since AI will be able to do those jobs much quicker, eliminate mistakes and ultimately save companies money through lack of salaries and benefits.
What’s your opinion? Know what? It really doesn’t matter. Artificial Intelligence is here to stay and will be used by companies. This leaves many employees with difficult decisions to make about their future and their careers.
The Future is Near
Artificial Intelligence is quickly changing the ‘’future of work,’’ and it will eliminate many aspects of most jobs. Even worse, as AI becomes more sophisticated, it will be able to overtake many of the difficult jobs.
Our ‘’future of work’’ can also be interpreted as meaning ‘’new and innovative ways of working’’ must be created and established since AI will be overtaking many of our current positions.
Could AI Train Humans?
One unique idea that has been circling innovative ideas is utilizing AI’s abilities to train humans. Is this really possible? Yes, it’s similar to many of the AI aids we now use, such as Google Maps. And, it’s possible that Artificial Intelligence could train humans. Why not take advantage of AI’s abilities since they are eliminating many of our human jobs? The training that AI can provide will result in humans learning more difficult and creative jobs.
A few companies are now on the path of making cloud-based training programs possible. They have done this by simply gathering massive amounts of data on one subject and categorized the data so that the data becomes a training tool.
This AI training is not done in a room with other students but is one that ‘’listens in’’ on conversations, such as sales and make recommendations to the ‘’student’’ about better words to use, suggests alternate tasks and makes other recommendation that will make sales more likely.
Is our future of work as humans making this training critical? Yes. Artificial intelligence will likely be able to do almost all current jobsOpens a new window  at some future point. The key to success as a human employee will be to have the skills that Artificial Intelligence has not yet conquered.
Artificial Intelligence Will Be Beneficial
There are many good points to Artificial Intelligence. Software startup expert Steve Ardire believes Artificial Intelligence will redesign the way organizations function. He says, “Human capital will start to shift from mundane tasks and transactions to higher-order and creative work. Along the way, we will see massive businesses where the technology transforms specific job functions.”
It’s important to remember that Artificial Intelligence does not have creative abilities and humans do. Many humans are very capable of creating and imagining many topics. According to Ardire, Artificial Intelligence will be about “people and machines working alongside each other to improve the way they work.”
If AI can work faster than humans and make fewer errors, it stands to reason that it will also help business growth. The world currently needs something to propel economic growth and Artificial Intelligence may be the answer. A very positive overall point is that AI will change how work is done while it also will help drive the knowledge level of humans in business.
Accenture believes that ‘’artificial intelligence could double annual economic growth rates in 2035 by changing the nature of work and creating a new relationship between man and machine. This new relationship between man and machines could potentially impact businesses that results in increased labor productivity by up to 40 percent.’’
A significant portion of this increase is because people will be more efficient and need less time to create their work. Futurists believe that mundane tasks will be worked by artificial intelligence technologies and human will do what AI cannot do:  imagine, create and innovate.
Even though artificial intelligence will make some work outdated, there are many possible advantages for an improved economy. The end result will be the creation of more profitability for companies that can then increase wages for humans.
Artificial Intelligence Will Not Takeover an Entire Occupation
Better yet, artificial intelligence will seldom capture an entire occupation. There will be certain tasks that artificial intelligence can do quicker and better than humans, but most jobs will still need some human activities. In reality, business processes will be modified, and human jobs will be recharacterized.
Entire occupations will not be replaced by artificial intelligence, but it is likely that all occupations will be affected by AI. McKinsey Global Institute’s research predicts that 45% of human work activities could be replaced by automation. All occupations, including the most sophisticated, such as executives, physicians, and financial experts, now perform tasks and activities that could be done by artificial intelligence.
All companies in all industries should expect to re-evaluate all jobs and all processes that could be assisted by artificial intelligence. **Companies must take advantage of the potential improvements AI can provide. And, the advantages are much more than the money saved by utilizing artificial intelligence**. The benefits expected included increased production, with higher quality and better-quality reliability. Additionally, AI can perform tasks easily at extraordinarily high levels, while performing significantly below human labor costs. As a result, **movement of artificial intelligence into portions of most human jobs will become standard and those companies who can utilize the greatest amounts of AI will become the most profitable**.
Ultimately, artificial intelligence will become an important viable differentiator. Those companies who automate activities needed within industries and occupations and redefine the roles and process of each will be the most successful and profitable. And, those humans who are given opportunities to learn the more sophisticated skills that AI cannot learn, will be the most likely to move upwards quicker than artificial intelligence can learn to be more human.

The proportion of railway equipment supply, product and services companies hiring for artificial intelligence related positions rose significantly in January 2022 compared with the equivalent month last year, with 41.4% of the companies included in our analysis recruiting for at least one such position.
This latest figure was higher than the 28.1% of companies who were hiring for artificial intelligence related jobs a year ago and an increase compared to the figure of 35.6% in December 2021.

When it came to the rate of all job openings that were linked to artificial intelligence, related job postings rose in January 2022, with 2.4% of newly posted job advertisements being linked to the topic.
This latest figure was the highest monthly figure recorded in the past year and is an increase compared to the 1.2% of newly advertised jobs that were linked to artificial intelligence in the equivalent month a year ago.See Also:Alstom launches new joint venture in China to supply Hefei metro Liebherr unveils propane-based train HVAC systems for Stadler

Artificial autonomous artist Botto created four artworks which sold for a combined $1.1m (£827,000) in November last year, fuelled by input and direction from German artist Mario Klingemann.“I hope that artificial  intelligence will develop enough so that Botto will be able to do things itself. It sounds like science fiction,” he told i. “Once that is possible it does not need me any more.”Similarly, Google made headlines around the world in 2015 when it showcased DeepDream, a neural network visualisation tool that generated nightmarish, psychedelic, hallucinogenic-like images from  ordinary pictures.",https://schema.org,,,,,,,,,"[{'@type': 'NewsArticle', '@id': 'https://inews.co.uk/news/technology/ai-cannot-copyright-art-creates-us-office-stephen-thaler-digital-artificial-intelligence-1474929#article', 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://inews.co.uk/news/technology/ai-cannot-copyright-art-creates-us-office-stephen-thaler-digital-artificial-intelligence-1474929'}, 'author': {'name': 'Rhiannon Williams', '@id': 'https://wp.inews.co.uk/#/schema/person/4aace2698e9f969a8fb5b61b1ad61fff', 'url': 'https://inews.co.uk/author/rhiannon-williams'}, 'headline': 'AI cannot copyright a digital art it creates, rules US Copyright Office in case of Creativity Machine', 'datePublished': '2022-02-22T12:33:05+00:00', 'dateModified': '2022-02-22T12:34:12+00:00', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@id': 'https://inews.co.uk/news/technology/ai-cannot-copyright-art-creates-us-office-stephen-thaler-digital-artificial-intelligence-1474929'}, 'wordCount': 476, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://wp.inews.co.uk/#organization'}, 'image': {'@type': 'ImageObject', '@id': 'https://wp.inews.co.uk/#/schema/ImageObject/22bd05ff0ea994425d1f9ec9a5473ed11396ed31', 'url': 'https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SEI_89439560.jpg', 'contentUrl': 'https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SEI_89439560.jpg', 'width': 1024, 'height': 670}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SEI_89439560.jpg', 'keywords': ['Art', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computers', 'Copyright', 'Digital', 'Inventions'], 'articleSection': ['Arts', 'News', 'Technology'], 'inLanguage': 'en-US'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://inews.co.uk/news/technology/ai-cannot-copyright-art-creates-us-office-stephen-thaler-digital-artificial-intelligence-1474929', 'url': 'https://inews.co.uk/news/technology/ai-cannot-copyright-art-creates-us-office-stephen-thaler-digital-artificial-intelligence-1474929', 'name': 'AI cannot copyright a digital art it creates, rules US Copyright Office in case of Creativity Machine', 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://wp.inews.co.uk/#website', 'type': 'WebSite'}, 'primaryImageOfPage': {'@id': 'https://inews.co.uk/news/technology/ai-cannot-copyright-art-creates-us-office-stephen-thaler-digital-artificial-intelligence-1474929#primaryimage'}, 'image': {'@id': 'https://inews.co.uk/news/technology/ai-cannot-copyright-art-creates-us-office-stephen-thaler-digital-artificial-intelligence-1474929#primaryimage'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SEI_89439560.jpg', 'datePublished': '2022-02-22T12:33:05+00:00', 'dateModified': '2022-02-22T12:34:12+00:00', 'breadcrumb': {'@id': 'https://inews.co.uk/news/technology/ai-cannot-copyright-art-creates-us-office-stephen-thaler-digital-artificial-intelligence-1474929#breadcrumb'}, 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'potentialAction': [{'@type': 'ReadAction', 'target': ['https://inews.co.uk/news/technology/ai-cannot-copyright-art-creates-us-office-stephen-thaler-digital-artificial-intelligence-1474929']}]}, {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', '@id': 'https://inews.co.uk/news/technology/ai-cannot-copyright-art-creates-us-office-stephen-thaler-digital-artificial-intelligence-1474929#primaryimage', 'url': 'https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SEI_89439560.jpg', 'contentUrl': 'https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/SEI_89439560.jpg', 'width': 2162, 'height': 1414, 'caption': 'A Recent Entrance to Paradise (""Work"") was made by the Creativitiy Machine (Photo: Steven Thaler/Creativity Machine)'}, {'@type': 'BreadcrumbList', '@id': 'https://inews.co.uk/news/technology/ai-cannot-copyright-art-creates-us-office-stephen-thaler-digital-artificial-intelligence-1474929#breadcrumb', 'itemListElement': [{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Home', 'item': 'https://inews.co.uk/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'News', 'item': 'https://inews.co.uk/category/news'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Technology', 'item': 'https://inews.co.uk/category/news/technology'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 4, 'name': 'AI cannot copyright a digital art it creates, rules US Copyright Office in case of Creativity Machine'}]}, {'@type': 'WebSite', '@id': 'https://inews.co.uk#website', 'url': 'https://inews.co.uk', 'name': 'inews.co.uk', 'description': 'Latest UK and world news, politics, lifestyle and sport, with analysis and opinion from the i paper.

Can A.I.-Generated Art Receive Copyright Protection? U.S. Authorities Say No, Citing a Lack of ‘Human Authorship’

The U.S. Copyright Office has once again rejected a request for copyright protection on a work created by artificial intelligence, affirming an earlier decision that found the work “lacks the human authorship necessary to support a copyright claim.”
The work in question, A Recent Entrance to Paradise, was put forth twice by Stephen Thaler on behalf of the “Creativity Machine,” the stated “author” of the work.
In his first application, made in November 2018, Thaler attached a note for the copyright office stating that the work “was autonomously created by a computer algorithm running on a machine” and said he was “seeking to register this computer-generated work as a work-for-hire to the owner of the Creativity Machine.”
After it was rejected, Thaler subsequently requested that the office reconsider its decision by arguing that “the human authorship requirement is unconstitutional and unsupported by either statute or case law.”
But the office re-evaluated the claims and again concluded, in a decision dated February 14, that the work “lacked the required human authorship” and that Thaler had “provided no evidence on sufficient creative input or intervention by a human author in the work.” 
“​​We disagree with the Copyright Office’s decision and plan to appeal,” Thaler’s Los Angeles-based attorney Ryan Abbott told Artnet News. “AI is able to make functionally creative output in the absence of a traditional human author and protecting AI-generated works with copyright is vital to promoting the production of socially valuable content. Providing this protection is required under current legal frameworks.”
Thaler’s effort is “an academic project” seeking to test copyright standards, Abbott said. Thaler is currently making similar efforts with patents, which have been granted to A.I.-generated projects in some countries (Australia and South Africa), but not in others (the U.S. and U.K.)
A Recent Entrance to Paradise is part of a series Thaler has described as a “simulated near-death experience,” in which an algorithm uses pictures to create trippy images and an invented narrative about the afterlife, according to The Verge, which first reported the copyright office’s recent decision. 
Abbott expects this to become an even more important issue in coming years as AI continues to improve in generating human-competitive output.

 A U.S. copyright body has ruled that a work of art created by artificial intelligence can't be classified as intellectual property and get copyright protection. So now, there is no shortage of AI programs out there that can do everything from creating abstract art and doling out ethical advice to summarising research papers in a few lines and upscale images. Take, for example, The Dream, an AI-fueled app from a Canadian startup that can create stunning digital art of mythical warriors, space warfare and more. 






 But the biggest question is if these artistic products can be protected under copyright laws. One of the most hotly contested topics happens to be deepfakes generated by algorithms, which can either create an altogether new person or mimic the likeness of a living individual. In 2020, Hip-ho mogul Jay-Z filed for copyright strikes against a YouTube channel that deepfaked his signature voice to recite acts like Shakesperean dramas. Debates around AI copyrights have been raging on for a while, but there might finally be a decisive turn of events to settle it. 

 Related: Who Is QAnon? AI Might Have Just Figured It Out 






 Addressing a petition covering digital art created by an algorithm named Creativity Machine, the U.S. Copyright Office has ruled that the painting called ""A Recent Entrance to Paradise"" can not be granted copyright protection in the name of its AI creator. The court ruling notes that the country's copyright laws only protect ""the fruits of intellectual labor"" that ""are founded in the creative powers of the [human] mind."" One might argue that building an AI requires human intellect and effort, but as per the court, the process of creating artwork can not be fully automated to AI and still be covered under copyright laws. To simplify the ruling, it states that a work of art derived from a machine or an automated mechanical process that doesn't require ""any creative input or intervention from a human author"" won't qualify for copyright law protections. 


 A Human Touch For All Creations 
  

    

  






 The legal copyright argument is that a work of art must be original and should be a tangible expression of a human being's ideas. In the domain of art, this covers everything from literary work and paintings to photographs and digital art. Additionally, a work of art must originate from a human being to get copyright law recognition. The court adds that authorship is a crucial distinction here, and it must involve human endeavor. In 2020, the European Patent Office ruled that an AI can not copyright its creations, noting that an inventor must be a human and not the machine. Also, in 2020, the United States Patent and Trademark Office made it clear that only humans can be legally credited as inventors. In September last year, The England and Wales Court of Appeals also arrived at the decision that an AI can't be classified as the inventor of a patent. 






 But the laws are not hard-coded, and a lot depends on how the argument is presented. For example, if a person aims to copyright a device or creation made with the help of an AI, even if the human input happens to be minimal, the fact that human effort was made will slot in favorably with copyright laws. So how does the poetry composed by something like Sophia, the humanoid robot, fare in light of the U.S. court ruling? It most likely will fail the copyright test. But if the mind behind its inherent language processing algorithms argues that the robot's poetry is based on Dante's work and was not solely an ingenious AI creation, the debate will get confusing.

Both AI and robotic solutions make it possible to improve construction efficiency and reduce costs
The robotics market will expand to US$8 billion in 2030, with a projected CAGR of 32.5%
According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, construction worker fatalities rose 5% in 2019, totaling 1,061 deaths

READ NEXTEmerging tech may allow robots to take over the world
The workplace is supposed to be a safe environment. However, industrial accidents still occur, due in part to the failure of employers and employees to take proper safety measures.
The construction sector, in particular, remains one of the most dangerous industries in the United States, accounting for a high percentage of workplace fatalities. With an increased number of large construction projects, safety concerns are on the rise too.     
Construction sites are dangerous, no matter how advanced the tools available to human workers. The machines and equipment used in construction work can be weighty and hard to handle, especially for humans who lack superhuman strength, coordination, and agility.
High construction fatalities in the US 
According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, construction worker fatalities rose 5% in 2019, totaling 1,061 deaths – making this the highest number of worker deaths recorded since 2007.
Despite safety measures taken to prevent accidents, workers still sustain severe injuries. In 2019, there were 229,410 injuries due to contact with objects and equipment, severe enough that they resulted in time away from work. Meanwhile, 1,270 US workers died in work-related crashes involving motor vehicles (24% of all deaths).
Harnessing AI solutions
Artificial intelligence (AI) may not be the first thing that comes to mind when thinking of construction, but it is a technology that could change the face of this often-treacherous industry. 
The application of artificial intelligence is spreading rapidly in the enterprise space, with AI solutions making it possible to improve efficiency and reduce costs. However, the adoption rate of harnessing AI maintenance solutions is still growing at a snail’s pace. 
The implementation of AI solutions involves significant challenges. First and foremost, companies need to integrate the technology into their existing infrastructure. Legacy systems cannot support AI solutions in many cases, which requires organizations to replace outdated technologies with new ones.
Firms incorporate AI with robotic add-ons
While most companies are still trying to figure out how to incorporate AI into their businesses, others have already started using the technology for a wide range of purposes. 
Most recently, Construction Robotics announced its new cobot, a brand new addition to their line of robotic arms used for construction purposes. The main goal of these cobot arms is to improve safety on construction sites by reducing manual labor and saving time for both workers and managers. 
RinTinto uses artificial intelligence (AI) to extract actionable insights to improve the safety and efficiency of their mines. AI is harnessed to perform a variety of tasks – from generating orebody models to organizing equipment dispatch to predicting maintenance needs.
Robotic scene growing exponentially
In the next five to 10 years, robotics will become a key player in making buildings. According to a new report from advisory firm ABI Research, the cobot market, which had a global valuation of US$475 million in 2020, will expand to US$8 billion in 2030, with a projected CAGR of 32.5%.

The construction industry will reap the benefits of this growth, as more robots are deployed onto building sites. Construction robots, such as those from FBR, formerly known as Fastbrick Robotics, can significantly improve efficiency and safety in construction projects. 
Meanwhile, the BotX Welder developed by Hirebotics and utilized Universal Robots’ UR10e collaborative robot arm, debuted in 2019. The BotX enables manufacturers to automate arc welding on small batch runs not feasible for traditional automatons.
AI and robotic solutions are set to transform the construction industry for both better and worse. On one hand, these innovations can be used to automate repetitive tasks and minimize accidents — reducing workers’ injuries. On the other hand, many jobs in this industry require a high degree of creativity and hands-on skill that few AI and robotic applications have been able to master.  With so many lives at stake, it’s high time for big changes in the industry.

Dr Vivienne Ming is a world-renowned theoretical neuroscientist known for her amazing work developing and using artificial intelligence (AI). A tech-hacker, inventor and innovator, Vivienne uses her knowledge to enact positive change – such as by using AI to challenge norms and improve outcomes around mental wellbeing, diversity, and workplace development. 
We were lucky enough to spend an hour with Vivienne talking about the mind-boggling potential impacts of AI on the world of HR. Yet before we can properly delve into this topic, we must first understand what artificial intelligence is. For many of us, the first thing that may spring to mind is a dystopian Hollywood depiction – like the evil sentient AI ‘Skynet’ from the Terminator movies. This is far from the current reality: ‘AI is just a tool. It is not an intelligent being,’ Vivienne assures us. Rather, it’s when a computer or robot can perform tasks that are usually reserved for intelligent beings; for example, identifying images or patterns and trends in data. 
Done right, the possibilities are endless.
The opportunities
‘When we use AI, we can see so much of what’s going on in an organisation, yet still treat people as individuals,’ Vivienne enthuses. ‘If I want to build a team, I can fit people together through complementary diversity. There’s no way a person in HR could truly get to know all the individuals of an organisation, but it is possible for these systems to know two people would work well together, even though they’ve never met.’
An initiative like this involves significant initial investment as a large amount of multi-dimensional data is required. For instance, Vivienne collected information on staff members’ previous work experience, cultural upbringing and socio-economic background, as well as conducting psychometric testing and more. This data was then manipulated using specific algorithms to identify trends and other key findings.  
So armed, the AI Vivienne built to leverage complementary diversity consistently created teams that outperformed those put together by traditional methods. ‘When you look at complementary diversity, you find that those teams come up with new solutions to problems more quickly and more frequently. Using AI as a tool in finding good new connections is important,’ she says. ‘Take a team that’s worked together for a long time – say a highly prolific scientific team that writes major impactful papers. In time their publication rate slowly increases, but the uniqueness of their work goes down. But the moment a new person joins with complementary diversity to the others, their “impactfulness” jumps right up again.’
‘Imagine doing that for the Australian Government. It’s about mixing and remixing. You don’t want to disrupt a high-performing team, but if you shift the right person out and bring the right new person in, it gives the team whole new life.’
With continuous testing and adding ever-more data, the AI then helped identify qualities that were more likely to lead to high-performing teams. Interestingly, Vivienne found the two strongest predictors of a team’s collective intelligence were, firstly people’s average emotional intelligence, and secondly whether they had the ability to see things from other people’s perspectives. This combination led to psychological safety, building trust, and embracing various types of diversity which strengthened the team. Even something as simple as gender diversity can make a big difference. ‘Teams with similar balances of men and women always outperform teams that have an imbalance.’
In another role, AI helped Vivienne identify an issue where young women working in technical fields weren’t benefitting from mentorships with older males, and in fact were experiencing increased stress. ‘In aggregate numbers the employer couldn’t see it, but our systems could identify and reveal that by showing recurring similarities – like those between negative mentee experiences and the demographic information of mentors.’
Vivienne follows this with an example of work at a more personal level, looking at mobility – specifically, using someone’s phone to track the way they moved through physical space. This data and how it changed over time, in combination with analysis of online conversations, could predict an oncoming episode of manic depression. ‘When we analyse the data we can actually predict stress levels, absenteeism, heart levels, post-partum depression… Even day-to-day stress rates associated with individuals by looking at language and movement patterns.’ Vivienne is clearly motivated by the potential to support staff to more effectively manage and enhance their mental health outcomes.
The risks
Vivienne is not ignorant of the risks that such technology and information provides. ‘We should talk about the good and the bad of AI hand-in-hand, because they’re just reflections of each other.’
One pitfall is in the method the technology is used. Ideally, Vivienne explains, AI should be used for augmentation, not substitution. Outsourcing decisions to AI instead of using it as a tool is a recipe for disaster. ‘There’s an idea that these systems can’t be biased… they’re just as biased as we are, but in different ways. When we see the errors algorithms make, they’re often absurd.’
A second significant risk lies in the type, detail and volume of data collected – which can be deeply personal – and how employers will use it. ‘That’s a very reasonable fear,’ Vivienne agrees. 
‘Many, many companies are deeply invested in using data sets on their own employees to shift ideas about work – for example, unionisation. If they could detect people who are more likely to unionise, they may not hire those people in the first place. That’s scary. And it’s a genuine goal of many big companies.
‘I’m first trying to validate those fears… Employers have a huge power imbalance with respect to their employees. We need ways of balancing this out again. It would be wonderful if HR departments did that but, in the private sector at least, HR is often there to protect the company.’
Vivienne says there is definitely a role for government to look at issues of data and AI abuse. But ultimately, she wants to empower individuals and give them control of their own data – perhaps in a similar way to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). 
‘It’s something all organisations should be thinking about.’
The timeline
When asked when we’ll start seeing AI used more broadly in HR, Vivienne predicted that we’re more likely to see progress in areas that aren’t as heavily regulated by government. ‘Hiring has strong legal protections. But in health and stress management – that’s where we’re seeing faster adoptions by organisations.
‘AI is coming into HR on the edges, but it’s beginning to have more profound impacts. Progressively more work, particularly work done by university-educated professionals, is seeing automation eating away at it. A perfect example is a radiologist. This job is high-skill, high-training, but still routine. An AI can identify an abnormality on an x-ray. AI presents a really profound threat to a classically high-paying job.’
Anywhere that people are doing lots of routine labour is at risk of being overtaken by AI, Vivienne argued. But by the same token, wages and opportunities for creative labour are increasing. ‘If there’s one thing I can get across, it’s that AI is just a tool,’ Vivienne summarises. ‘It’s what we do with it that actually matters. There will always be a role for creative people. 
‘The line I often use is that “An artist without a tool is hobbled. But a tool without an artist is nothing”.’
For large organisations including government, HR needs to start planning for an AI-ready future. We should be looking to embrace the opportunities that AI presents, with eyes wide open to the risks – especially protecting the rights of our people.

Artificial intelligence based projects to shift towards employee productivity
By 2025, the market of artificial intelligence is expected to grow at a CAGR of 20.2 per cent over five years, with total revenues of $7.8 billion in India
As more companies realise the role artificial intelligence can play in providing a competitive advantage and in sculpting the future of work, the focus of artificial intelligence (AI) based projects in India will shift towards cost efficiencies and employee productivity, according to a Deloitte report.
The Deloitte 2022 Technology, Media and Entertainment and Telecom report showed that the convergence of computing processing, connectivity and artificial intelligence will bring about more engagement between businesses and customers.
Currently, most applications of artificial intelligence are in areas where there is a strong human element, like human resources, or where efficiencies can be gained, like contact centres, said P N Sudarshan, partner and TMT industry leader, Deloitte India.
There is a shift underway to extend this to areas like education to try and accelerate the learning process. By 2025, the market of artificial intelligence is expected to grow at a CAGR of 20.2 per cent over five years, with total revenues of $7.8 billion in India, predicts International Data Corporation (IDC).
Globally, the priorities around AI are shifting towards regulation and securing emerging technologies like AI, said Duncan Stewart, director of TMT Research, Deloitte Canada.
Homomorphic encryption and federated learning are among the set of privacy enhancing technologies that are being deployed towards solving the problem of how artificial intelligence tasks can be performed more privately and securely.
India is well poised to latch on to non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, among other trends. Entertainment and sport NFTs could potentially disrupt the industry if regulation is favourable. The market is likely to be more volume focused, driven by fractional NFTs, which would also lower the entry barrier, it said.
The ongoing global shortage of semiconductor chips means India has the potential to tap into its domestic market and set up domestic semiconductor and electronics manufacturing facilities in the next three-five years.
“As the ecosystem matures in the medium to long term, we expect India to emerge as a strong regional hub in semiconductor and electronics manufacturing”, Sudarshan said.
“The government’s recent announcement on the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for the semiconductor and electronics manufacturing industries has the potential to create an end-to-end ecosystem for manufacturing electronic products. We expect the broader shift to digital to continue in 2022 and drive the industry growth in the future”, he added.
When it comes to addressing the top three challenges for at-scale treatment of mental health in India – awareness and stigma, access to medical professionals, and cost-effective treatment, Technology will also play a significant role, and this will gain more widespread applications in the next few years.

One decision about your workforce can have a massive impact on your business—whom to hire, whom to promote, and when to cut back—can be the difference between a successful and unsuccessful business venture. With so much pressure to make the right workforce decisions, HR teams are starting to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to guide decision-making processes in order to increase accuracy and efficiency, while decreasing the risk of error.
For example, AI can be used within an HR department to identify a pool of applicants that are most qualified for a job, without letting biases about a person’s age, gender, ethnicity, or background influence the decision. Or it can analyze payrolls within an organization to spot salary discrepancies to help close the gender pay gap.
And while AI systems can identify a solution faster than the human brain, how much of the decision-making process should be delegated to AI? Are there some decisions that should always be reserved for humans? My father Earl Hunt did pioneering work in AI and noted, “We discovered pretty quickly that computers aren’t very good at mimicking how the human brain actually works. But they are very good at solving complex problems that the human brain could never solve.”
So this all begs the question: What’s the difference between letting a computer or a human call the shots? Well, let’s take a look at what those differences might be, and what they could mean for your business:
What kind of problems we’re looking at
Let me start off by saying, AI renders numerable benefits—like tackling the complex problems my father described, but humans have one thing that AI doesn’t: adaptability.  We’re naturally good at identifying problems worth solving, and there is no problem we cannot meaningfully think about even if we cannot always solve it. In contrast, AI can only solve problems that it is told to solve by humans. More importantly, it can only effectively address problems that meet certain specific conditions, which are, interestingly enough, the kinds of problems that humans commonly struggle to solve.
How and why both approach problems differently
AI and humans not only solve different kinds of problems, but they also approach solving them very uniquely as well. Humans are adept at developing solutions without fully defining the problem, which makes us amazingly flexible and considerably prone to errors. For AI it is the opposite because the first requirement for the use of AI is to have a precise empirical definition of what you are trying to model, identify, or predict. For example, in order to use AI to predict employee performance, you must first define what you mean by “performance” in highly measurable terms.
That would never happen if a human being were to look at a problem. That’s because humans are comfortable making decisions based on very small amounts of data, since we find it hard to process large amounts of it. Sometimes, we can take that small amount of data and make intuitive impressions that are amazingly accurate, while other times they are totally wrong. In contrast, most AI methods require very large datasets containing matched pairs of “predictor data” and “criteria data.” For example, to model work characteristics causing employee stress, you would need predictor data that measured characteristics that might cause stress, as well as criteria data on these same employees that measured stress levels. Not to mention, you’ll probably need data on thousands of employees for an AI program to create an accurate model.
AI is very effective at sorting through large datasets to find small bits of meaningful information, but it cannot find meaningful information unless it is reflected in mathematical patterns in the data. Of course, AI is amazingly good at finding treasures of useful information in massive piles of garbage data, but it can’t find treasures in data that is entirely composed of garbage.
AI is also a powerful problem-solving method for situations where outcomes have precise empirical definitions, there is access to large matched predictor-criteria datasets, and small but meaningful relationships exist between predictor and criteria data. Thanks to the amount of data made available through human capital management (HCM) technology, we are finding more and more situations that meet these conditions.  Examples include modeling relationships between applicant characteristics and post-hire retention, job characteristics and employee turnover, and employee work characteristics and absenteeism and healthcare costs. But there are many HCM situations that do not meet and may never meet these conditions; for example, using AI to predict notoriously poorly defined outcomes like performance and potential.
It is important to know when AI is likely to work and when it will not work. The kinds of problems AI is good at solving are usually the kinds of problems humans find difficult or impossible to solve, and vice-versa. AI should be positioned as a tool to support better decision making, but it cannot be a replacement for human intelligence.
Why it’s important to define a difference between the two
Anyone who has read science fiction knows the danger of turning over too much power to machines. Though both man and machine solve problems in different ways and offer unique benefits when it comes to problem-solving, many people harbor concern about computers making decisions that determine what they can do in life. This includes decisions that impact our employment and careers. Saying a company is making HCM decisions using AI could create anxiety for many employees and candidates, so it’s important to draw a distinction between the two, and show the value each bring to the decision-making process. Start by avoiding using words like AI that people associate with science fiction, and instead used terms that are more boring yet more accurate such as “mathematically developed models.”
Manage expectations around artificial intelligence in HCM
AI is about using complex mathematical techniques to address specific types of HCM problems that impact organizational performance. These mathematic models do not work everywhere, and sometimes there’s just nothing that can replace the human touch, but in the right situations, they work extremely well. So, in order to be able to successfully leverage by AI and human thinking during the decision-making process, it’s important that you first and foremost set expectations. Avoid hyping up AI, and focus on educating your business on how to combine complex math, sophisticated computer programming, large data sets, and of course, the human brain, to improve certain types of HCM practices. That way, both resources can be used to their potential, and you can make the best decisions possible for your business.

Will Tech Go Against Women?,"How can AI algorithms be racist and sexist? Is it against women even in the digital world?.Even though the first person to write an algorithm was a woman in the 19th century, Artificial Intelligence may now be discriminating against women. Artificial intelligence may inherit, or even amplify, the biases of its creators. and most AI hasn't heard about the global feminist movement. artificial intelligence has issued a stark warning against the use of race- and gender-biased algorithms for making critical decisions.AI bias occurs when results cannot be generalized widely. We often think of bias resulting from preferences or exclusions in training data, but bias can also be introduced by how data is obtained, how algorithms are designed, and how AI outputs are interpreted. In 2018, researchers discovered that popular facial recognition services from Microsoft, IBM, and Face++ can discriminate based on gender and race. Microsoft was unable to detect darker-skinned females 21% of the time, while IBM and Face++ wouldn't work on darker-skinned females in roughly 35% of cases. There are so many AI gender biases happening now, this impact on the daily life of all women: from job searches to security checkpoints at airports..How do AI algorithms discriminate against women?.An employer was advertising for a job opening in a male-dominated industry via a social media platform. The platform's ad algorithm pushed jobs to only men to maximize returns on the number and quality of applicantsA white man who goes to an airport, he will quickly pass, but a woman with dark skin will be waiting in a long line.&quot;In job recruitment processing industry is male-dominated, the majority of the resumes used to teach the AI were from men, which ultimately led the AI to discriminate against recommending womenFacebook posted ads for better-paid jobs to white men, while women and people of color were shown ads for less well-paid jobs.Face-analysis AI programs display gender and racial bias, if you are a woman with dark skin, it will work worse. demonstrating low errors for determining the gender of lighter-skinned men but high errors in determining gender for darker-skinned womenVoice-activated technology in cars systems is tone-deaf to women's voices.Google searches for 'black girls' to produced sexist and pornographic results..Amazon AI recruiting tool that showed bias against women:.One of the best-known cases of discrimination based on the use of Artificial Intelligence was Amazon's attempt at automating their recruitment system. their new recruiting engine did not like women. Amazon's experimental recruiting engine followed the same pattern as Top U.S. tech companies that have yet to close the gender gap in hiring. Amazon's algorithm penalized resumes that included words related to the female gender, even in the hobbies of the candidates. In 2018, it came to light that the American multinational had discarded its AI tool, with which it had been selecting candidates applying for jobs for four years because it was sexist..That is because Amazon's computer models had been trained to vet applicants by observing patterns in resumes submitted to the company over 10 years. Most of these resumes were men's, a reflection of male dominance across the tech industry, creating a machine-learned bias that favored male applicants..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
