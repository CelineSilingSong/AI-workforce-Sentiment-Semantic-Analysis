The purpose of automation is to reduce the amount of human effort needed to do a task. But we need more human effort than ever to build and maintain those automated systems.

That’s the paradox of technology, and now that parts of the world are emerging on the other side of the Covid crisis (hopefully), the job market is heating up again, and companies are hungry for human talent who can alleviate their need to hire human talent. Amazon — which turned many labor markets on their heads by accelerating e-commerce and on-site automation — recognizes this shift, providing free cloud computing training to 29 million people around the world by 2025, in addition to committing more than $700 million to upskill 100,000 of its own employees in that time.


Cognizant released its quarterly Jobs of the Future Index, predicting a “strong recovery” for the US jobs market this coming year, especially those involving technology. The technology market, which saw lower rates of hiring six to eight months ago, but is primed for strong recovery as organizations accelerate their adoption of cloud strategies and AI solutions, the survey shows. Of all the jobs tracked in the Cognizant report, AI, algorithm and automation jobs saw a 28% gain over the last quarter, with “robotics engineer” and “video game designer” being two of the fastest-growing jobs - with 73% and 54% growth in jobs postings for these positions in the last three months. Algorithms, automation, and AI, the largest family in the index, realized a 28% gain over the quarter.

Ardine Williams, VP of workforce development at Amazon, believes the past year was one of revitalization and reinvention for many people as they reconsider their career options. “The scale of the disruption was staggering and so was the pace of adaptation,” she says. “Many used this disruption as an opportunity to revitalize or to reinvent their skills. Last year we saw unprecedented participation in cloud skills training during the lockdown. This interest came from learners on both ends of the spectrum – from those who were completely new to the cloud and looking to understand the fundamentals, to seasoned professionals who were looking to take advanced courses in areas like machine learning.”

PROMOTED
This interest was reflected in AWS’s array of cloud courses. The number of learners taking the vendor’s free, fundamental cloud courses — AWS Training and Certification — in May 2020 versus May 2019 jumped 152%, Williams shares. “We’re seeing the cloud support accelerated growth across industries, and this has been especially true during the pandemic,” Williams says. “When we look back, we’ll see that the pandemic accelerated cloud adoption.”
The impending shortage of STEM skills poses the greatest risk to post-Covid growth, Williams says. “There is a shortage of talent with the necessary cloud skills that is leaving many technical roles unfilled and hampering businesses’ digital transformation objectives.” There is no way around this — it’s incumbent for enterprises to invest in training their own talent to tackle this skills shortage, she adds. Amazon’s own investment in close to $1 billion illustrates its efforts to address potential skill shortages.

Along with sharpening technology skills, the drive to re-invent extends to business innovation. “What we’ve seen over the past year is a wellspring of creativity and reinvention, driven by necessity,” says Williams. “The greatest barrier to reinvention is often how difficult it can be to take apart something you’ve worked hard to build. The pandemic forced the issue for many. A key feature of businesses that survived and flourished was innovation.”

Williams sees “tremendous opportunity to integrate that innovation into the culture of organizations. Looking forward, leaders need to be intentional about creating and nurturing an environment that places employee skills, learning, and experimentation at the forefront.”
She adds that “it’s hard to think of an industry that is not evolving, and the pace of innovation seems to be accelerating. The area that has been very interesting to watch and experience is the restaurant industry. Integrated technology solutions helped businesses get their restaurants online, connect with delivery services, and run outdoor operations with minimal staff via QR code menus, contactless payments, and the scale of the cloud.”
As the world re-opens, “these changes are helping restaurants cope with limited labor availability and with their bottom line,” says Williams. “I suspect that like the profound changes we saw in oil-field staffing models after the Great Recession, many of these shifts in restaurant business models are here to stay. That means that a lot of workers from the food service industry will need to upskill.”

All 7,400 tonnes of it.Around 260 miles away in Plymouth, another submarine made its debut that same day. A minnow compared to HMS Anson, this secretive nine-tonne craft may have greater implications for the future of the navy than the £1.3bn nuclear boat. MSubs of Plymouth, a specialist in autonomous underwater vehicles, won a £2.5m Ministry of Defence contract to build and test an Extra-Large Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (XLUUV) that should be able to operate up to 3,000 miles from home for three months. The big innovation here is the autonomy. The submarine's movements and actions will be governed entirely by Artificial Intelligence (AI). Ollie Thompson is a recent graduate who is studying for a master's degree in robotics at Plymouth University. He also works for MarineAI, the MSubs arm that is fitting out the XLUUV's brain. MsubsMSubs of Plymouth won a £2.5m contract to build and test an Extra-Large Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (XLUUV)Mr Thompson has no doubts about the challenge he and his colleagues face: ""We know a lot of people don't have confidence in AI. So we work with elements we can test, we separate things into boxes.""He divides the AI problem into components - and mission management is the toughest. This attempts to simulate the presence of a trained captain in the little submarine's programming. This is AI working in total isolation from human contact, not least because maintaining strict radio silence is critical to a submarine's covert role. The technical principle here is machine learning, showing an AI program examples of how a task should be performed until it has embedded the right actions in its own repertoire. To do this, MarineAI is using a huge IBM AC922 supercomputer, ""a monster, one of the biggest in the South-West of England"" Mr Thompson boasts. In contrast the on-board brain of the submarine resides in a 15cm square box and relies on an Nvidia chip often found driving computer games.""We built it off the back of the Nvidia chip because it's highly energy efficient,"" says Mr Thompson. Just like a tiny but powerful Raspberry Pi device used to teach schoolchildren basic programming tasks this approach takes up very little power. And keeping power consumption to the bare minimum is critical to making the submarine's battery last. BAe SystemsHMS Anson and others under construction. In future, submarines will launch their own autonomous vesselsIt's clear that the Ministry of Defence is paying very close attention to battery technology for this project. So far MarineAI is relying on existing technology derived from car batteries. But it notes that research in this field is leaping forward. The AI content of the computer should prioritise tasks. The project envisages a boat that can travel to an area of the sea-bed to search for mines or plant a sophisticated electronic intelligence-gathering package or stay in place and scour its environment for information on a hostile navy. So MarineAI is creating a decision-making capacity for the submarine's brain. It will know how much battery life is left and how to weigh that against prevailing weather conditions and sea states, reaching a logical decision on whether to sail on or return home in the face of strong tides. The project has oceans left to cross. For instance, how can the submarine detect small objects on the surface such as jet-skis?  All of these dilemmas are small beer for human submarine captains. Commander Ryan Ramsey captained the hunter-killer HMS Turbulent and taught on the Perisher, a five-month-long course the navy uses to push prospective submarine skippers to the limit.  Ryan RamseyRyan Ramsey captained the hunter-killer submarine HMS TurbulentThis decides if they are fit to command 100 or more submariners working punishing watches consisting of six hours on, six hours off for the duration of a long patrol. Cdr Ramsey worked in AI after leaving the navy and can see where smart software and human instinct might not produce the same response.""AI will struggle to match human decision-making skills. There are lots of submariners skills you can transfer to it, but you have to accept that the first generation will not be perfect."" He cites how he would study opposing Nato submarine commanders he went up against in exercises, learning how far each individual was prepared to push a vessel. ""The reality is that if you don't know how a guy operates he will find your submarine before you find him. You can't replicate that emotional input in AI."" More Technology of BusinessMind-boggling magnets could unlock plentiful powerTaking an invention from idea to the marketplaceFood giants respond to worries over packaging'It's your device, you should be able to repair it'What will happen to all the dead car batteries?If the XLUUV is ever to be armed that might create serious problems. The decision to fire a torpedo rests on a huge reserve of each officer's instincts and experience. ""If you leave that to a rules-based system you might escalate things. There is just so much to learn about the underwater battlespace.""In the future Cdr Ramsey believes submarines will be equipped with the ability to launch their own autonomous vessels. The next generation of surface warships entering service are already planned to feature mission-bays for launching uncrewed vessels. And autonomous submarines can be deployed by transport aircraft, giving the batteries a rest and the XLUUV a global reach. The longer-term prospect for AI-controlled submarines is rosy, says Cdr Ramsey. ""I can see a way to do a Perisher for AI. Get the right people to recreate their experiences in a simulator and let the AI learn from that, including human decisions that might be wrong. Give it ten years' worth of data and it will be able to build its own rules."" This simulator-based course for computer code promises another big benefit. ""The AI can test out its own rules without any risk. My worry with autonomous submarines is the political impact if the vessel does something wrong or gets caught in hostile waters,"" he says.   BoeingBoeing is working on autonomous subs for the US NavyPlymouth's trial submarine is based on an MSubs design known as the S201. And across the Atlantic, Boeing is building a series of large uncrewed submersibles as the US Navy works out how these vessels can be used. Former submariners talk about the degree of teamwork and close comradeship required to perform their missions. AI cannot replicate this, but it does not need to if all it is doing is saving sailors from exhausting and repetitive tasks better allocated to a drone. The Royal Navy is coy about its plans for this technology and is committed to a next generation of crewed nuclear submarines. Yet the work of Plymouth's AI pioneers may see their most perilous missions delegated to an AI program that never goes off watch.

We all know the drill&mdash;you polish your cover letter, spruce up an old resume and summon the courage to click send. After that, your career is in the hands of the hiring manager.Except that isn't always the case. In many instances, instead of your application being tossed aside by a HR professional, it is actually artificial intelligence that is the barrier to entry. While this isn't a problem in itself&mdash;AI can reduce workflow by rapidly filtering applicants&mdash;the issue is that within these systems lies the possibility of bias.It is illegal in the U.S. for employers to discriminate against a job applicant because of their race, color, sex, religion, disability, national origin, age (40 or older) or genetic information. However, these AI hiring tools are often inadvertently doing just that, and there are no federal laws in the U.S. to stop this from happening.Kevin Butler is CEO at Centigy, a company that assesses human resources AI software. He told Newsweek there are ""over a thousand AI HR tools on the market right now. Lots of organizations are using them, the uptake is pretty high.""These programs range from screening resumes and rating competency, to using facial recognition tools and analyzing a person's voice, body language or even, controversially, their emotions.But how can a computer system, devoid of feeling or social prejudices, discriminate?Well, a recent example of a piece of HR AI software that may have displayed racial bias was a facial identification tool that Uber used to conduct security tests on its drivers.The software, created by Microsoft, has a record of not recognizing darker-skinned faces, and in 2018 there was a recorded 20.8 percent failure rate for females with darker skin, as opposed to 0 percent when tested on white men.Fourteen Uber couriers lost their jobs after the new security measure was adopted last April, and claimed this was down to the AI failing to recognize their dark skin color.An Uber spokesperson told Newsweek that while ""there is always room for improvement"" the company ensures the software is ""fair and important"" with additional human reviews.Dr. Robert Elliot Smith, chief of science and technology at Centigy, explained to Newsweek that these problems can arise because ""many facial recognition software programs have been trained primarily with white faces, oftentimes with white male faces.""He said: ""When you've trained a program on data, it will automatically absorb whatever biases existed in the data."" However, issues around racial biases also happen because hiring AI is often trained on historical data and classifications of race have evolved over time.Smith, who wrote the book Rage Inside the Machine: The Prejudice of Algorithms, and How to Stop the Internet Making Bigots of Us All, said: ""When I was a kid, growing up in Alabama, certainly you were asked to record your personal data but if you were asked about race it would be white or Black. They might have had 'other,' or Native American perhaps.""Well America is a much more diverse place than that now, and categories have expanded. If you think about when 50 years ago there was segregation of races and a lot of people didn't identify as mixed, it just didn't exist when people were segregated.""While many hiring tools may have inbuilt racial biases because of such blind spots, this historical data can also mean there is gender-based discrimination.Smith explained: ""A lot of those programs, if you would say 'the doctor came into the room', they would insert the pronoun 'he' because the vast majority of data would be that men are doctors.""If it is trained on historical data it can very subtly and very undetectably absorb the language biases that are from the past. There are tons of examples of gender biases in computer programming.""This is problematic when a company is using a tool to seek out a candidate as it will favor men. In 2018 Amazon scrapped plans for its own AI hiring system, as Reuters reported that it had ""taught itself that male candidates were preferable"" due to them often having more tech industry experience on their resume.An Amazon spokesperson told Newsweek it had trialed the system but due to its failings it was ""never used by Amazon recruiters to evaluate candidates.""However, there have also been examples of AI systems being discriminatory even before someone applies for the job. Back in 2015 the MIT Technology Review found that Google's algorithms meant men were more likely to be advertised better-paid and more senior roles than women.For people who are transgender, Butler explains, AI hiring tools can also be unfair. He said: ""I was talking to a representative from the trans community a few weeks ago. She struggles to get a job in some organizations because she can't pass the background check. The system is trying to find her name, and can only back so far, because her name was changed a few years ago &hellip; You're just not hired because it is too difficult.""However, one of the most contentious uses of an AI hiring tool pertains to not what a person is, but how a person feels. In January HireVue, one of the industry leaders in the hire tech sector, scrapped its widely criticized software that used a candidate's facial expressions from video interviews as a factor its algorithms considered.HireVue told Newsweek its decision to remove the visual analysis was based on its own research and it had been independently audited twice recently, with no issues in terms of bias.Smith explained how analyzing facial expressions could be discriminatory. ""Take if you are a person who is a minority part of neurodiversity, you are a person who emotionally reacts differently, a person on the spectrum, for instance,"" he said. ""You are going to be discriminated against based on emotion detection because the way that you encode emotion and react to emotion is entirely different from the average person.""But there is good news, as these inadvertent biases will not go legally unchecked for much longer. The European Union has proposed regulation governing artificial intelligence, which includes the HR sector. Within a year companies using these hiring tools will need access to employment attorneys who understand technology, AI, as well as these EU privacy and tech regulations.In America, too, this is beginning to gain traction. In February 2020 New York City introduced a bill that regulates the use of AI in hiring, compensation and other HR decisions. If enacted this will prohibit the sale of AI technology unless it has been audited for bias or passed certain anti-bias tests in the year prior to its sale.However, Smith predicts that before the U.S adopts widespread regulation, there will be legal battles.

Photo: Nurbek kyzy Sonun / UNDP KyrgyzstanA new mobile application “IshtApp” for job-match between the unemployed and employers, developed by UNDP with the financial support of the Government of Japan, was launched in Bishkek today. 
In support of socioeconomic recovery, UNDP has developed an application for job search in all regions of Kyrgyzstan, offering an innovative matching system for the unemployed and employers to meet their respective needs in searching jobs and adequate workforce. It is targeted to help the recently unemployed, many of whom were working in the shadow economy, such as daily workers and returning migrants, including women, youth, and minorities to link to new employment opportunities and access skills upgrading services.
A job seeker can register an account, add, change or remove her resume, search vacancies using multiple settings or directly chat with potential employers. An employer can register an account, and create, edit or remove vacancies. The website www.ishtapp.kg(link is external) allows to administer all processes related to this job-match platform to include management and monitoring of resumes, generation of analytics related to the labor-market trends based on information processed and received from all users including the unemployed and employers. In addition, users can access the free training courses. The application is available in both Kyrgyz and Russian languages.
UNDP Resident Representative Louise Chamberlain said: “The economic and social disruption caused by COVID-19 has caused many businesses to fail and forced them to let go of their workers. The impact is becoming more apparent as the pandemic continues with deepening poverty and affecting the vulnerable populations most. But the pandemic has also brought opportunities, and the digital economy offers a recovery path that is more equitable and greener. The App helps match job seekers and employers throughout the country and enables investment in digital entrepreneurship,” said Chamberlain.
“We will carry out a number of activities to help solve the social and economic issues that emerged in Kyrgyzstan due to COVID-19. We expect that the application will become a reliable platform for job seekers and employers to find one another. Citizens of Kyrgyzstan who have lost their jobs, labour migrants forced to return home during the pandemic, employers, and small and medium-sized businesses will benefit from this platform,” said His Excellency Maeda Shigeki, the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Japan to the Kyrgyz Republic.
 “Our goal was to create a convenient and functional application with the best vacancies in Kyrgyzstan in real time. The app has an Artificial Intelligence-based analytical system which shows users only the most relevant vacancies. The online platform allows to find most suitable employers or job seekers in the shortest time,” Mr. Mirbek Okenov, the Director of Ulut Soft company that worked on the application explains.
The mobile application was first created under the pilot project “Skills for Reintegration” implemented by the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ) in 2018. Granted the rights by GIZ to develop the application further, UNDP makes efforts to develop additional services within the app.
IshtApp offers an opportunity to build on digital connectivity in Kyrgyzstan, where the mobile Internet penetration is 94 percent (Freedom House, 2020) and 92 percent of the population has mobile phones (National Statistics Committee of Kyrgyzstan, 2018).
In 2020, a joint report(link is external) (2020) by the Asian Development Bank, UNDP, and the Economic Policy Research Institute under the Ministry of Economy of the Kyrgyz Republic titled “COVID-19 in the Kyrgyz Republic: Socioeconomic and Vulnerability Impact Assessment and Policy Response(link is external)”, expected the unemployment rate to exceed 20%. Recently, the National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic presented a sample survey “Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Households”, in which approximately 22% of households claimed that at least one member of their families lost their job or was forced to return from abroad due to loss of earnings.The app is available at:

A new cross-disciplinary research initiative at MIT aims to promote the understanding and use of AI across all segments of society. The effort, called Responsible AI for Social Empowerment and Education (RAISE), will develop new teaching approaches and tools to engage learners in settings from preK-12 to the workforce.

“People are using AI every day in our workplaces and our private lives. It’s in our apps, devices, social media, and more. It’s shaping the global economy, our institutions, and ourselves. Being digitally literate is no longer enough. People need to be AI-literate to understand the responsible use of AI and create things with it at individual, community, and societal levels,” says RAISE Director Cynthia Breazeal, a professor of media arts and sciences at MIT.

“But right now, if you want to learn about AI to make AI-powered applications, you pretty much need to have a college degree in computer science or related topic,” Breazeal adds. “The educational barrier is still pretty high. The vision of this initiative is: AI for everyone else — with an emphasis on equity, access, and responsible empowerment.”

Headquartered in the MIT Media Lab, RAISE is a collaboration with the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing and MIT Open Learning. The initiative will engage in research coupled with education and outreach efforts to advance new knowledge and innovative technologies to support how diverse people learn about AI as well as how AI can help to better support human learning. Through Open Learning and the Abdul Latif Jameel World Education Lab (J-WEL), RAISE will also extend its reach into a global network where equity and justice are key.

The initiative draws on MIT’s history as both a birthplace of AI technology and a leader in AI pedagogy. “MIT already excels at undergraduate and graduate AI education,” says Breazeal, who heads the Media Lab’s Personal Robots group and is an associate director of the Media Lab. “Now we’re building on those successes. We’re saying we can take a leadership role in educational research, the science of learning, and technological innovation to broaden AI education and empower society writ large to shape our future with AI.”

In addition to Breazeal, RAISE co-directors are Hal Abelson, professor of computer science and education; Eric Klopfer, professor and director of the Scheller Teacher Education Program; and Hae Won Park, a research scientist at the Media Lab. Other principal leaders include Professor Sanjay Sarma, vice president for open learning. RAISE draws additional participation from dozens of faculty, staff, and students across the Institute.

“In today’s rapidly changing economic and technological landscape, a core challenge nationally and globally is to improve the effectiveness, availability, and equity of preK-12 education, community college, and workforce development. AI offers tremendous promise for new pedagogies and platforms, as well as for new content. Developing and deploying advances in computing for the public good is core to the mission of the Schwarzman College of Computing, and I’m delighted to have the College playing a role in this initiative,” says Daniel Huttenlocher, dean of the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing.

The new initiative will engage in research, education, and outreach activities to advance four strategic impact areas: diversity and inclusion in AI, AI literacy in preK-12 education, AI workforce training, and AI-supported learning. Success entails that new knowledge, materials, technological innovations, and programs developed by RAISE are leveraged by other stakeholder AI education programs across MIT and beyond to add value to their efficacy, experience, equity, and impact.

RAISE will develop AI-augmented tools to support human learning across a variety of topics. “We’ve done a lot of work in the Media Lab around companion AI,” says Park. “Personalized learning companion AI agents such as social robots support individual students’ learning and motivation to learn. This work provides an effective and safe space for students to practice and explore topics such as early childhood literacy and language development.”

Diversity and inclusion will be embedded throughout RAISE’s work, to help correct historic inequities in the field of AI. “We're seeing story after story of unintended bias and inequities that are arising because of these AI systems,” says Breazeal. “So, a mission of our initiative is to educate a far more diverse and inclusive group of people in the responsible design and use of AI technologies, who will ultimately be more representative of the communities they will be developing these products and services for.”

This spring, RAISE is piloting a K-12 outreach program called Future Makers. The program brings engaging, hands-on learning experiences about AI fundamentals and critical thinking about societal implications to teachers and students, primarily from underserved or under-resourced communities, such as schools receiving Title I services.

To bring AI to young people within and beyond the classroom, RAISE is developing and distributing curricula, teacher guides, and student-friendly AI tools that enable anyone, even those with no programming background, to create original applications for desktop and mobile computing. “Scratch and App Inventor are already in the hands of millions of learners worldwide,” explains Abelson. “RAISE is enhancing these platforms and making powerful AI accessible to all people for increased creativity and personal expression.”

Ethics and AI will be a central component to the initiative’s curricula and teaching tools. “Our philosophy is, have kids learn about the technical concepts right alongside the ethical design practices,” says Breazeal.  “Thinking through the societal implications can’t be an afterthought.”

“AI is changing the way we interact with computers as consumers as well as designers and developers of technology,” Klopfer says. “It is creating a new paradigm for innovation and change. We want to make sure that all people are empowered to use this technology in constructive, creative, and beneficial ways.”

“Connecting this initiative not only to [MIT’s schools of] engineering and computing, but also to the School of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences recognizes the multidimensional nature of this effort,” Klopfer adds.

Sarma says RAISE also aims to boost AI literacy in the workforce, in part by adapting some of their K-12 techniques. “Many of these tools — when made somewhat more sophisticated and more germane to the adult learner — will make a tremendous difference,” says Sarma. For example, he envisions a program to train radiology technicians in how AI programs interpret diagnostic imagery and, vitally, how they can err.

“AI is having a truly transformative effect across broad swaths of society,” says Breazeal. “Children today are not only digital natives, they’re AI natives. And adults need to understand AI to be able to engage in a democratic dialogue around how we want these systems deployed.”

To ensure the safe and effective use of artificial intelligence in healthcare, researchers and developers will need to work to eliminate bias in these tools, according to a perspective paper by Stanford University researchers.







As artificial intelligence tools grow more prevalent in the medical field, leaders need to make sure these technologies benefit all populations and demographics.
“The white body and the male body have long been the norm in medicine guiding drug discovery, treatment and standards of care, so it’s important that we do not let AI devices fall into that historical pattern,” said Londa Schiebinger, the John L. Hinds Professor in the History of Science in the School of Humanities and Sciences at Stanford.
“We’re hoping to engage the AI biomedical community in preventing bias and creating equity in the initial design of research, rather than having to fix things after the fact.”
To develop equitable AI devices, adequate data collection is a key first step. The team noted that while public datasets often fail to represent minority populations, private datasets that may be more diverse are usually restricted to a single hospital or academic center.
Improving the reliability of AI systems will require leaders to fix this gap, and there are several existing efforts that aim to do so.
“The paucity of annotated photos of darker-skin individuals is a significant barrier for dermatology and telehealth algorithms. The Stanford Skin of Color Project is an ongoing crowd science effort to collect and curate the largest publicly available dataset of dermatologically relevant images from darker skin tones. This data can help to train and assess machine learning models,” researchers said.
“In genetics, there are similar efforts to prioritize the collection and analysis of non-European genetics data, which is necessary for genetic understandings of diseases such as polygenetic risk scores to benefit diverse populations. For example, the recent PAGE study demonstrates a robust framework to identify new genetic correlates of phenotypes using over 49,000 non-European individuals.”
In addition to collecting diverse data, researchers emphasized the importance of consistently evaluating AI tools, even after organizations have deployed them.
“Post deployment monitoring of AI algorithms is an emerging area of research. Researchers have developed statistical tests to detect if the data that an algorithm is applied to is substantially different from the data that the algorithm was trained on. These tests trigger real-time warnings that the deployed AI algorithm may have biases due to its training data. This can be a practical approach for monitoring,” the team wrote.
“We recommend that hospitals and regulators such as the FDA consider the monitoring framework and the AI algorithm as a holistic package to be evaluated and deployed together.”
In terms of longer-term solutions, the team cited the need for regulatory agencies to promote equity in AI use.
“The FDA has set out five criteria for excellence in its Digital Health Innovation Action Plan. The specific guidelines to certify medical computer-aided systems, however, do not mention sex, gender, or other axes of health disparities in data collection,” researchers stated.
“We recommend expanding the current FDA guidelines for software as a medical device (SaMD) to include a four-part pre- and post-market review of ML health tools: an analysis of health disparities in the clinical domain of interest; a review of training data for bias; transparency surrounding decisions made regarding model performance, especially in relation to health disparities; and post-market review of health equity outcomes.”
Universities could also support the development responsible AI by refining coursework and curricula.
“Ethics is most often taught in stand-alone modules (39 percent) and not linked to core curricula (28 percent–the other 33 percent combine both approaches),” the group said.
“The AI for biomedicine community can also benefit from curriculum that incorporates ethics into computational training by drawing from the relevant material in both CS and medical ethics.”
Teams should also be diverse to ensure algorithms don’t exacerbate disparities, the team stated.
“Additional problems may arise from the lack of gender and ethnic diversity in AI teams, a situation that can contribute to perpetuating unconscious biases in research design and outcomes. Teams should be diverse in terms of participants and also in terms of skill sets and methods,” researchers said.
“AI researchers themselves should understand the basics of sex, gender, diversity, and intersectional analysis as these relate to their technical work.”
The widespread use of AI in healthcare will depend on the ability for researchers and developers to eliminate potential bias.
“As with other biomedical technologies such as genome sequencing and editing, it is critical that innovation in biomedical AI is complemented by efforts to reduce human risk and to ensure that its benefits are broadly shared by diverse countries and populations,” the team concluded.
“Clearly, technology alone is not the fix; large social problems that undergird structural inequality need to be addressed. Nonetheless, researchers and educators can do their part to develop education and technologies that strive toward social justices.”

You’d get your prescription from your doctor, then start picking up frames and trying them on at random. You had no idea what would look good on you, so your best option was to try on everything and hope for the best.

Transforming Retail With Augmented And Virtual Reality, Powered By Artificial Intelligence: The Case ... [+] Of Eyewear ShoppingAdobe Stock
If your eyes are bad, trying on frames and trying to decide if they were suitable was extremely challenging – you might not be able to see your hand in front of your face without your prescription lens. How could you decide what frames to invest in by squinting in the mirror?

PROMOTED
These days – especially in the midst of a global pandemic – we don’t want to make an appointment to visit an optician, then be confined to a tiny selection of glasses. We also don’t want to guess about what’s going to look good on us, or spend hours physically trying on frames.

The way we buy glasses is ripe for disruption. Now, with the help of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and artificial intelligence (AI), the entire process of getting an eye exam and purchasing eyewear is changing radically.

VR headsets are evolving so quickly, and experts predict that soon they’ll be enabled with cameras that can deliver a 100% virtual eye test. The headset will be able to shine a light into the back of your eye to detect problems, as well as determine your prescription with precision.

Then the VR system will automatically deliver a digital prescription – you no longer have to worry about carrying around a paper prescription to give to a commercial retailer.
Once you have that prescription, you can enter a virtual showroom to “try on” frames and make a selection.

Shopping Using Augmented Reality
Warby Parker already leverages augmented reality to help their customers shop for glasses online.
They use the face-mapping features of Apple iPhones to help users put on virtual frames, similar to using SnapChat filters that let us add cat whiskers or ears to our faces. The glasses even stay on your face as you turn your head.
In this new “virtual try-on” world, powered by AR, you also get personalized recommendations that go far beyond the advice you’d get at an in-person optician’s showroom. With AI, online retailers can scan the shape of your face and make recommendations for frames that will look good on you.
The AI can even scan your social media profiles to get a sense of your style and preferences, then make recommendations for frames that will suit your personal style. With VR and AR, the entire process becomes far more customer-centric.
Instead of standing in a showroom feeling frustrated, then ending up getting glasses that don’t actually look good on you, you can select the perfect pair using a personalized, fun process enabled by AR, VR, and AI.
