AI is quickly changing the business landscape in nearly every category. Many leaders are giddy with the promise that AI will automate mundane tasks, write code, contextualize data to support decision-making and more. However, amidst these dreamy AI promises, a new narrative of opportunity and growth is taking shape as AI tools move from press conference announcements to true productivity tools.


Since Microsoft's first announcement of generative AI (GAI) search using ChatGPT in February, GAI has been a top priority for businesses worldwide as they envision a future where AI catalyzes increased productivity, efficiency and innovation. But it's not just Big Tech that has its sights set on AI. Business visionaries from companies of every size have embarked on a quest to uncover the true potential of AI and its transformative impact on how work is done. Companies like Microsoft, Cisco, Adobe, Zoho and more are helping those businesses realize that potential.

This year's Microsoft Build 2023 developer conference was a prime example of companies setting up users—from developers to SMBs to individual contributors—for success. Moor Insights & Strategy CEO and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead wrote a complete analysis of the vast number of AI advancements Microsoft announced at Build 2023 that included some of my own insights. I want to build on that summary by looking further at how GAI tools introduced by Microsoft and others impact the everyday worker and how companies are building copilots and assistants into people's workflows to make them more productive in their day-to-day functions.

PROMOTED
Extracting the most value from AI

At Microsoft Build 2023, one of the central themes was “copilots.” While AI promises to accomplish incredible feats in many different areas, for scope of impact copilots are especially important because of how these AI assistants help people with their everyday tasks. Take the Copilot experience in Windows 11 and Edge, for example. Users can access this feature from the taskbar, providing a consistent pane across all apps. The side-pane design reduces the toggle time for accessing information and aims to boost productivity. It certainly can save time, even compared to the first integration of ChatGPT into Windows 11, which took just a few clicks to access.
Microsoft's approach aims to complement people in their roles by integrating copilots directly into users' workflows. In Microsoft 365, the Copilot feature acts as a companion in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Teams and more, running alongside users in apps they use daily. Microsoft 365 Copilot can boost productivity by providing real-time suggestions and assistance as users work on documents, presentations or spreadsheets. As users create content, Copilot analyzes the context and offers relevant tips, such as recommended phrases, data formatting options or relevant images to enhance the document. 365 Copilot is available now in a limited private preview, with broader availability coming soon.

Zoho recently announced similar ChatGPT-driven capabilities for current users across several applications, including Desk, Social, Writer and Mail, where people do their regular daily tasks. Zoho's AI-powered assistants are currently available to all users, and the company says it is adding GAI to products across its platform.

Firefly and the content flywheel
Earlier this year, Adobe announced Firefly, its family of generative AI models that I believe delivers a human-centered approach to AI by empowering creatives to do their best work. As part of The Six-Five Summit this week, I enjoyed chatting with Ely Greenfield, CTO of digital media at Adobe, for a spotlight session: Adobe's Approach to Generative AI. For Adobe, Firefly is just one small part of the company's AI journey.
As Greenfield explains, Firefly is the initial step in a broader plan to create additional models catering to different content types and addressing various use cases. This could potentially (likely) mean that Firefly will expand into video, audio and 3-D vector artwork, covering a wide range of creative applications.
Additionally, Adobe digital experience products will further benefit from GAI with the company's Sensei AI tool that can assist in developing campaign briefs, analyzing customer data, adapting images, targeting specific customer segments and optimizing customer journeys. The company aims to leverage these capabilities to generate compelling content and gain insights for continuous improvement.
For individual creators or large marketing teams, having the power to generate and iterate on content quickly—and on platforms they already use—is transformative. ""We know from hearing from customers that the demands for content creation and content generation are bursting at the seams right now. As customer interactions get more personalized and focused, the content needed to be generated increases exponentially. Integrating generative AI into their tools and workflows will be a massive benefit,"" Greenfield said.Webex meeting summary Cisco
Cisco calls in GAI for its suite of Webex products
This week at Cisco Live in Las Vegas, Cisco Webex announced several GAI summarization capabilities. Catch Me Up meeting recaps will offer meeting summaries with action items so that attendees won't miss anything. This is useful, for example, for someone coming in late from another meeting, plus it saves the more punctual attendees from having to repeat themselves for the latecomer. Conversation summaries within Webex allow users to give prompts and ask questions using AI as the keeper of information—allowing collaboration among participants without everyone needing to be present.
What I am most excited about in this context is summaries for Webex's Vidcast video messaging tool. Vidcast summaries will organize video information into chapters on specific themes or areas as well as overall highlights, so users can navigate to the information they need. These days, it is common enough to be double-booked and miss a meeting, only to watch it later. It is also not uncommon for a manager or coworker to benefit from knowing what transpired during a meeting they didn't attend. AI summaries are a game-changing time saver for these and other asynchronous collaboration scenarios. I am actually a big fan of “live” meetings, whether in person or by video call, but watching a playback of a meeting is my idea of torture. So summaries and transcripts are a big win for people like me.
Cisco also announced conversation summaries in Webex Cloud Contact Center. Conversation summaries for contact centers allow for a seamless handoff during escalation or dropped calls and undoubtedly will make customer interactions more efficient. There is little that’s more frustrating than a lousy customer service chatbot or infinite-loop phone-tree failure when you need customer service. With conversation summaries, when you call back, the next agent will have all that information and be ready to resolve the issue.
All of the Webex summary capabilities will be available by the end of the year. While many of Webex’s competitors like Zoom and Microsoft Teams have already announced similar capabilities, these were necessary and smart additions for the Webex platform.
In Summary
In this ever-changing business landscape, the potential for humans to flourish alongside intelligent machines is vast when used responsibly. The copilot model shows how AI can enhance operations and workflows beyond mere automation by providing contextual help that extends the effectiveness of humans rather than trying to replace them. By harnessing the power of AI alongside human ingenuity, these companies are reshaping the future of their industries.

India is poised to harness the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to drive economic growth and development at scale. With its vast and diverse economy, coupled with a large population, India has a unique opportunity to leverage AI to deliver benefits to businesses, industries, and society.

Most recently, India placed sixth in terms of AI investments between 2013-2022, totalling USD7.73 billion over the last ten years with about 40% of that received in 2022.
Against this background, technology industry leaders have noted that AI is at an inflection point, with powerful new models like generative AI being introduced, and innovative new applications increasingly being used across society and capturing the imaginations of consumers. Generative AI has opened the door to more possibilities and is expected to play a role in tasks requiring creativity, curiosity, and looking at information differently. Therefore, the potential of generative AI lies in its ability to enable people to achieve greater creativity, effectiveness, and efficiency in their work.
This report seeks to contribute to this discussion by providing early insights and raising awareness of the economic opportunities that generative AI can create, and what it means for local industries and workforce readiness.
This study estimates that generative AI can potentially unlock USD621 billion of productive capacity in India, equivalent to close to one-fifth of GDP in 2021. India has an opportunity to better position its businesses and workers to unlock the potential of generative AI, as well as manage emerging risks. Policymakers will need to ensure that they have a clear national vision for AI, and that it focuses on preparing its workforce and establishing an enabling policy environment for AI adoption, including to answer the question “what is required to achieve the aspirations of a brighter future enabled by generative AI?”

Most recently, India placed sixth in terms of AI investments between 2013-2022, totalling USD7.73 billion over the last ten years with about 40% of that received in 2022.', 'breadcrumb': {'@id': 'https://accesspartnership.com/the-economic-impact-of-generative-ai-the-future-of-work-in-india/#breadcrumb'}, 'inLanguage': 'en-GB', 'potentialAction': [{'@type': 'ReadAction', 'target': ['https://accesspartnership.com/the-economic-impact-of-generative-ai-the-future-of-work-in-india/']}]}, {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'inLanguage': 'en-GB', '@id': 'https://accesspartnership.com/the-economic-impact-of-generative-ai-the-future-of-work-in-india/#primaryimage', 'url': 'https://cdn.accesspartnership.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/The-Future-of-work-India.png', 'contentUrl': 'https://cdn.accesspartnership.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/The-Future-of-work-India.png', 'width': 1280, 'height': 720}, {'@type': 'BreadcrumbList', '@id': 'https://accesspartnership.com/the-economic-impact-of-generative-ai-the-future-of-work-in-india/#breadcrumb', 'itemListElement': [{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Home', 'item': 'https://accesspartnership.com/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'The Economic Impact of Generative AI: The Future of Work in India'}]}, {'@type': 'WebSite', '@id': 'https://accesspartnership.com/#website', 'url': 'https://accesspartnership.com/', 'name': 'Access Partnership', 'description': 'Specialists in public policy, around the world', 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://accesspartnership.com/#organization'}, 'potentialAction': [{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': {'@type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'https://accesspartnership.com/?s={search_term_string}'}, 'query-input': 'required name=search_term_string'}], 'inLanguage': 'en-GB'}, {'@type': 'Organization', '@id': 'https://accesspartnership.com/#organization', 'name': 'Access Partnership', 'url': 'https://accesspartnership.com/', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'inLanguage': 'en-GB', '@id': 'https://accesspartnership.com/#/schema/logo/image/', 'url': 'https://accesspartnership.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ap-logo.png', 'contentUrl': 'https://accesspartnership.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ap-logo.png', 'width': 191, 'height': 64, 'caption': 'Access Partnership'}, 'image': {'@id': 'https://accesspartnership.com/#/schema/logo/image/'}}, {'@type': 'Person', '@id': 'https://accesspartnership.com/#/schema/person/dc46cc9889520e1234a3d6b9f349427e', 'name': 'luca_oneill', 'image': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'inLanguage': 'en-GB', '@id': 'https://accesspartnership.com/#/schema/person/image/', 'url': 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e1029ba85d9e79ce68b2d07e1138ef00?s=96&d=mm&r=g', 'contentUrl': 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e1029ba85d9e79ce68b2d07e1138ef00?s=96&d=mm&r=g', 'caption': 'luca_oneill'}}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Generative AI is causing many fields of expert and professional knowledge to reassess fundamental practices and their value. Taking law, a field that has long been warned of potential threats of automation, as a focus, Giulia Gentile outlines the socio-technical challenges facing the discipline and considers how new technology may rebalance relationships between lawyers, technologists and clients.

We are still wrapping our heads around the potential impact of AI in our society. No fields seem to be immune from the influence of AI, including the legal profession broadly understood. Lawyers, clerks and legal advisors across the world are all exploring the implications of AI. Two different questions are currently occupying legal professionals when it comes to AI, showcasing the Janus-faced power of this technology (and tools such as ChatGPT).
The first issue is how AI can be embedded in the legal profession to enhance the work of the legal professional. The more immediate advantage of AI is that of improving the efficiency of legal work by way of automation. Tools, such as ChatGPT, could, for instance, be used to draft contracts or skeletons of judgments. Law firms have announced the trialling of robo-lawyers.
The second, more concerning, matter is how AI could carry out at least some of the tasks traditionally performed by lawyers. Could AI replace lawyers? Inevitably, AI is raising questions that are reshaping the legal profession as a whole. This is what I want to focus on here.
1. Pressure/Complexity/Interdisciplinarity
The advance of technology is increasing the demands and the expectations from lawyers. Most lawyers currently practising have no training in data science, algorithms or AI. Therefore, currently there is an informational gap affecting the profession: any future use of AI will require lawyers to upskill and learn at least the basics of these technologies.

The degree of expertise required is debatable. Should lawyers become AI experts? This may not be achievable for the current generation. A reasonable alternative would be for lawyers to work more closely with AI experts, although this would make lawyers dependent in a way on AI experts. Moreover, such cooperation might not necessarily achieve AI systems that are fit for the purposes of lawyers – the design of AI tools for lawyers is likely to take time and input from the lawyers themselves in terms of training. Even then, by the time a system is trained new AI technology may have emerged and rendered the purpose-built tool obsolete. If so, the interdisciplinary process – pressurised by the technological race – would begin again.
This means that AI may – rather than simplifying life in the legal profession – simply risk making it much more complex and guided by the demands of technology, rather than those of clients and the law.
2. Transforming the relationship with clients?
The complexity resulting from the influence of AI on the legal profession is also reshaping the relationship between lawyers and clients. This is because the way in which AI is used in the work of lawyers also influences the liability of legal advisors and their professional obligations towards their clients. For instance, lawyers have a duty to provide their clients with clear information that is not misleading (see for instance the SRA code of conduct). The use of AI may make compliance with that duty much more difficult and complex for two reasons.
First, lawyers need to understand AI tools to be able to explain them. As mentioned, the current digital literacy of lawyers may be limited and, in any event, even experts have difficulty tracing how an AI system has taken a decision due to the ‘black box’ problem. This compromises the ability of lawyers to keep their clients informed.
Second, AI systems such as neural networks may learn on their own and acquire features that were not envisaged in the initial stage of the AI design. In addition, it is well reported how AI tools may provide information that may look correct, but it is not – so-called hallucinations. This means that these tools may be unpredictable, with significant risks of errors and potential damages to clients. Recently, a US lawyer used ChatGPT to draft briefs, which went awry when it made up authorities to support its arguments. He is now facing sanctions.
As a result, the duty of lawyers to provide clear information not to mislead their clients may prove challenging when AI is used in the professional sector based on the current technologies. These settings ultimately affect the trust that the public has towards lawyers.
3. Public perception of the legal profession using AI
No less important is the transformation of public perception and trust that the introduction of AI into the legal profession may instigate.
Clients who are being exposed to ‘robo-lawyers’, automated legal advice, or the risks deriving from the use of AI to draft contracts or other legal documents, may ultimately lose confidence and trust in the legal profession. The human dimension of the relationship between lawyers and clients is necessary to establish trust, understanding and empathy. Clients need to know that their lawyers understand their problems and will try to solve them. But this trust dynamic could be seriously undermined by robo-lawyers or over-reliance by lawyers on AI tools.
For instance, if a technology like ChatGPT were used to provide a preliminary legal advice, it may not fully understand the demands of the client. It may also fail to offer the same level of empathy, human connection, and legal creativity of a human lawyer. The essential question is: would we feel comfortable taking what could be the most important advice in your life from a robot? Troubling as the question may sound, some may answer “yes!”. Doubtless, even the best human lawyers are flawed and not all human lawyers are the cream of the crop – so one may wonder whether we should give up faith in human lawyers. But, as with automation bias in other fields, this perspective ignores that machines will also be flawed (albeit in different ways, not all of which are currently known or properly understood). A challenge for the legal profession will be demonstrating to the public that it is growing with new technologies to address human fallibility. Doing so will involve passing between Scilla and Charybdis: the desire to “keep the law human” on the one hand, and blind faith in the “superior” powers of poorly understood and developing technologies (which will inevitably be flawed) on the other.
Putting finer points to one side, could we be as passionate about Erin Brochovic and Harvey Specter if we knew they were just cold calculating machines?

Job listings asking for generative AI skills are on the rise, a new analysis from job search engine Adzuna has found.In May, Adzuna advertised 7.8 million job vacancies in the US. Among these, ads citing generative AI grew to 1,496 as of May this year compared to 185 job listings in January, and just three in May 2022.Generative AI is a relatively new tech buzzword but Corporate America has been keen to show it's on top of the new trend since the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November sparked interest. Companies have been scrambling to incorporate the flood of AI products released in recent months into workflows to improve efficiency and cut costs. At least 49 listed US companies bought up ChatGPT in quarterly earnings calls in May 2023, according to an analysis of Seeking Alpha transcripts by Insider.

James Neave, head of data science at Adzuna, said: ""In the US, not only are markets powered by AI but with AI in focus for both investors and job seekers, we're seeing an increase in jobs citing Generative AI.""

The top sectors citing the AI trend were IT, engineering, scientific and QA, accounting and finance, and sales, per Adzuna. Neave added that the platform was also seeing an increase in jobs that require working with ChatGPT. These jobs are lucrative, too. The average advertised salary for jobs citing Generative AI is $146,244, while the average for jobs that require working with ChatGPT is $133,000, according to Adzuna.

""Based on Adzuna research, we expect businesses will continue posting more job ads citing Generative AI, ChatGPT, and chatbots as this year goes on,"" Neave said.The new tech trend has already popularized some jobs, including ""prompt engineers"" — experts who write text rather than code to test AI-powered chatbots. Their job is to identify errors and hidden capabilities for developers, Insider's Aaron Mok previously reported. The role doesn't always require a tech-related degree and job-seekers can earn up to $375,000 a year.

AI is also seen as a threat to some jobs. In an early analysis, Goldman Sachs predicted Generative AI could lead to significant upheaval in the labor market, affecting around 300 million jobs globally. Since then, CEOs have started explicitly saying they plan to replace some workers with AI.For example, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna recently said the company plans to pause hiring for 7,800 jobs that could be replaced by AI.

Among these, ads citing generative AI grew to 1,496 as of May this year compared to 185 job listings in January, and just three in May 2022.Generative AI is a relatively new tech buzzword but Corporate America has been keen to show it's on top of the new trend since the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November sparked interest. Companies have been scrambling to incorporate the flood of AI products released in recent months into workflows to improve efficiency and cut costs. At least 49 listed US companies bought up ChatGPT in quarterly earnings calls in May 2023, according to an analysis of Seeking Alpha transcripts by Insider.James Neave, head of data science at Adzuna, said: ""In the US, not only are markets powered by AI but with AI in focus for both investors and job seekers, we're seeing an increase in jobs citing Generative AI.""The top sectors citing the AI trend were IT, engineering, scientific and QA, accounting and finance, and sales, per Adzuna. Neave added that the platform was also seeing an increase in jobs that require working with ChatGPT. These jobs are lucrative, too. The average advertised salary for jobs citing Generative AI is $146,244, while the average for jobs that require working with ChatGPT is $133,000, according to Adzuna.""Based on Adzuna research, we expect businesses will continue posting more job ads citing Generative AI, ChatGPT, and chatbots as this year goes on,"" Neave said.The new tech trend has already popularized some jobs, including ""prompt engineers"" — experts who write text rather than code to test AI-powered chatbots. Their job is to identify errors and hidden capabilities for developers, Insider's Aaron Mok previously reported. The role doesn't always require a tech-related degree and job-seekers can earn up to $375,000 a year.AI is also seen as a threat to some jobs. In an early analysis, Goldman Sachs predicted Generative AI could lead to significant upheaval in the labor market, affecting around 300 million jobs globally. Since then, CEOs have started explicitly saying they plan to replace some workers with AI.For example, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna recently said the company plans to pause hiring for 7,800 jobs that could be replaced by AI.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He relied a bit too heavily on the artificial-intelligence (AI) chatbot. It created a motion replete with made-up cases, rulings and quotes, which Mr Schwartz promptly filed after the bot assured him that the “cases I provided are real and can be found in reputable legal databases” (they were not, and cannot).

IntroductionArtificial intelligence (AI) is a vast technology used in the education sector. Several types of AI technology are used in education (Nemorin et al., 2022). Majorly includes Plagiarism Detection, Exam Integrity (Ade-Ibijola et al., 2022), Chatbots for Enrollment and Retention (Nakitare and Otike, 2022), Learning Management Systems, Transcription of Faculty Lectures, Enhanced Online Discussion Boards, Analyzing Student Success Metrics, and Academic Research (Nakitare and Otike, 2022). Nowadays, Education Technology (EdTech) companies are deploying emotional AI to quantify social and emotional learning (McStay, 2020). Artificial intelligence, affective computing methods, and machine learning are collectively called “emotional AI” (AI). Artificial intelligence (AI) shapes our future more powerfully than any other century’s invention. Anyone who does not understand it will soon feel left behind, waking up in a world full of technology that feels more and more like magic (Maini and Sabri, 2017). Undoubtedly, AI technology has significant importance, and its role has been witnessed in the recent pandemic. Many researchers agree it can be essential in education (Sayed et al., 2021). but this does not mean it will always be beneficial and free from ethical concerns (Dastin, 2018). Due to this, many researchers focus on its development and use but keep their ethical considerations in mind (Justin and Mizuko, 2017). Some believe that although the intentions behind AI in education may be positive, this may not be sufficient to prove it ethical (Whittaker and Crawford, 2018).There is a severe need to understand the meaning of being “ethical” in the context of AI and education. It is also essential to find out the possible unintended consequences of the use of AI in education and the main concerns of AI in education, and other considerations. Generally, AI’s ethical issues and concerns are innovation cost, consent issues, personal data misuse, criminal and malicious use, freedom and autonomy loss, and the decision-making loss of humans, etc. (Stahl B. C., 2021a, 2021b). Although, technology also enhances organizational information security (Ahmad et al., 2021) and competitive advantage (Sayed and Muhammad, 2015) and enhances customer relationships (Rasheed et al., 2015). Researchers are afraid that by 2030 the AI revolution will focus on enhancing benefits and social control but will also raise ethical concerns, and there is no consensus among them. A clear division regarding AI’s positive impact on life and moral standing (Rainie et al., 2021).It is evident from the literature on the ethics of AI that besides its enormous advantages, many challenges also emerge with the development of AI in the context of moral values, behavior, trust, and privacy, to name a few. The education sector faces many ethical challenges while implementing or using AI. Many researchers are exploring the area further. We divide AI in education into three levels. First, the technology itself, its manufacturer, developer, etc. The second is its impact on the teacher, and the third is on the learner or student.Foremost, there is a need to develop AI technology for education, which cannot be the basis of ethical issues or concerns (Ayling and Chapman, 2022). The high expectations of AI have triggered worldwide interest and concern, generating 400+ policy documents on responsible AI. Intense discussions over ethical issues lay a helpful foundation, preparing researchers, managers, policymakers, and educators for constructive discussions that will lead to clear recommendations for building reliable, safe, and trustworthy systems that will be a commercial success (Landwehr, 2015). But the question is, is it possible to develop an AI technology for education that will never cause an ethical concern? Maybe the developer or the manufacturer has dishonest gain from the AI technology in education. Maybe their intentions are not towards the betterment and assistance of education. Such questions come to mind when someone talks about the impact of AI in Education. Even if the development of AI technology is clear from any ethical concerns from the developer or manufacturer, there is no guarantee for the opposite view. The risk of ethical considerations will also rely upon the technical quality. Higher quality will minimize the risk but is it possible for all educational institutions to implement expensive technology of higher quality? (Shneiderman, 2021). Secondly, many issues may arise when teachers use AI technology (Topcu and Zuck, 2020). It may be security, usage, implementation, etc. Questions about security, bias, affordability, trust, etc., come to mind (IEEE, 2019). Thirdly, privacy, trust, safety, and health issues exist at the user level. To address such questions, a robust regulatory framework and policies are required. Still, unfortunately, no framework has been devised, no guidelines have been agreed upon, no policies have been developed, and no regulations have been enacted to address the ethical issues raised by AI in education (Rosé et al., 2018).It is evident that AI technology has many concerns (Stahl B. C., 2021a, 2021b), and like other sectors, the education sector is also facing challenges (Hax, 2018). If not all the issues/problems directly affect education and learning, most directly or indirectly impact the education process. So, it is difficult to decide whether AI has a positive ethical impact on education or negative or somewhat positive or negative. The debate on ethical concerns about AI technology will continue from case to case and context to context (Petousi and Sifaki, 2020). This research is focused on the following three moral fears of AI in education:

1.
Security and privacy


2.
Loss of human decision-making


3.
Making humans lazy

Although many other concerns about AI exist in education, these three are the most common and challenging in the current era. Additionally, no researcher can broaden the study beyond the scope.Theoretical discussionAI in educationTechnology has impacted almost every sector; reasonably, it also needs time (Leeming, 2021). From telecommunication to communication and health to education, it plays a significant role and assists humanity in one way or another (Stahl A., 2021a, 2021b). No one can deny its importance and applications for life, which provides a solid reason for its existence and development. One of the most critical technologies is artificial intelligence (AI) (Ross, 2021). AI has applications in many sectors, and education is one. Many AI applications in education include tutoring, educational assistance, feedback, social robots, admission, grading, analytics, trial and error, virtual reality, etc. (Tahiru, 2021).AI is based on computer programming or computational approaches; questions can be raised on the process of data analysis, interpretation, sharing, and processing (Holmes et al., 2019) and how the biases should be prevented, which may impact the rights of students as it is believed that design biases may increase with time and how it will address concerns associated with gender, race, age, income inequality, social status, etc. (Tarran, 2018). Like any other technology, there are also some challenges related to AI and its application in education and learning. This paper focuses on the ethical concerns of AI in education. Some problems are related to privacy, data access, right and wrong responsibility, and student records, to name a few (Petousi and Sifaki, 2020). In addition, data hacking and manipulation can challenge personal privacy and control; a need exists to understand the ethical guidelines clearly (Fjelland, 2020).Perhaps the most important ethical guidelines for developing educational AI systems are well-being, ensuring workplace safety, trustworthiness, fairness, honoring intellectual property rights, privacy, and confidentiality. In addition, the following ten principles were also framed (Aiken and Epstein, 2000).

1.
Ensure encouragement of the user.


2.
Ensure safe human–machine interaction and collaborative learning


3.
Positive character traits are to be ensured.


4.
Overloading of information to be avoided


5.
Build an encouraging and curious learning environment


6.
Ergonomics features to be considered


7.
Ensure the system promotes the roles and skills of a teacher and never replaces him


8.
Having respect for cultural values


9.
Ensure diversity accommodation of students


10.
Avoid glorifying the system and weakening the human role and potential for growth and learning.

If the above principles are discussed individually, many questions arise while using AI technology in education. From its design and planning to use and impact, at every stage, ethical concerns arise and are there. It’s not the purpose for which AI technology is developed and designed. Technology is advantageous for one thing but dangerous for another, and the problem is how to disintegrate the two (Vincent and van, 2022).In addition to the proper framework and principles not being followed during the planning and development of AI for Education, bias, overconfidence, wrong estimates, etc., are additional sources of ethical concerns.Security and privacy issuesStephen Hawking once said that success in creating AI would be the most significant event in human history. Unfortunately, it might also be the last unless we learn to avoid the risks. Security is one of the major concerns associated with AI and learning (Köbis and Mehner, 2021). Trust-worthy artificial intelligence (AI) in education: Promises and challenges (Petousi and Sifaki, 2020; Owoc et al., 2021). Most educational institutions nowadays use AI technology in the learning process, and the area attracted researchers and interests. Many researchers agree that AI significantly contributes to e-learning and education (Nawaz et al. 2020; Ahmed and Nashat, 2020). Their claim is practically proved by the recent COVID-19 pandemic (Torda, 2020; Cavus et al., 2021). But AI or machine learning also brought many concerns and challenges to the education sector, and security and privacy are the biggest.No one can deny that AI systems and applications are becoming a part of classrooms and education in one form or another (Sayantani, 2021). Each tool works according to its way, and the student and teacher use it accordingly. It creates an immersive learning experience using voices to access information and invites potential privacy and security risks (Gocen and Aydemir, 2020). While answering a question related to privacy concerns focuses on student safety as the number one concern of AI devices and usage. The same may go for the teacher’s case as well.Additionally, teachers know less about the rights, acts, and laws of privacy and security, their impact and consequences, and any violations cost to the students, teachers, and country (Vadapalli, 2021). Machine learning or AI systems are purely based on data availability. Without data, it is nothing, and the risk is unavoidable of its misuse and leaks for a lousy purpose (Hübner, 2021).AI systems collect and use enormous data for making predictions and patterns; there is a chance of biases and discrimination (Weyerer and Langer, 2019). Many people are now concerned with the ethical attributes of AI systems and believe that the security issue must be considered in AI system development and deployment (Samtani et al., 2021). The Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal is one of the significant examples of how data collected through technology is vulnerable to privacy concerns. Although much work has been done, as the National Science Foundation recognizes, much more is still necessary (Calif, 2021). According to Kurt Markley, schools, colleges, and universities have big banks of student records comprising data related to their health, social security numbers, payment information, etc., and are at risk. It is necessary that learning institutions continuously re-evaluate and re-design the security practices to make the data secure and prevent any data breaches. The trouble is even more in remote learning environments or when information technology is effective (Chan and Morgan, 2019).It is also of importance and concern that in the current era of advanced technology, AI systems are getting more interconnected to cybersecurity due to the advancement of hardware and software (Mengidis et al., 2019). This has raised significant concerns regarding the security of various stakeholders and emphasizes the procedures the policymakers must adopt to prevent or minimize the threat (ELever and Kifayat, 2020). It is also important to note that security concerns increase with network and endpoints in remote learning. One problem is that protecting e-learning technology from cyber-attacks is neither easy nor requires less money, especially in the education sector, with a limited budget for academic activities (Huls, 2021). Another reason this severe threat exists is because of very few technical staff in an educational institution; hiring them is another economic issue. Although, to some extent, using intelligent technology of AI and machine learning, the level and threat of security decrease, again, the issue is that neither every teacher is a professional and trained enough to use the technology nor able to handle the common threats. And as the use of AI in education increases, the danger of security concerns also increases (Taddeo et al., 2019). No one can run from the threat of AI concerning cybersecurity, and it behaves like a double-edged sword (Siau and Wang, 2020).Digital security is the most significant risk and ethical concern of using AI in education systems, where criminals hack machines and sell data for other purposes (Venema, 2021). We alter our safety and privacy (Sutton et al., 2018). The question remains: whether our privacy is secured, and when will AI systems become able to keep our confidentiality connected? The answer is beyond human knowledge (Kirn, 2007).Human interactions with AI are increasing day by day. For example, various AI applications, like robots, chatbots, etc., are used in e-learning and education. Many will learn human-like habits one day, but some human attributes, like self-awareness, consciousness, etc., will remain a dream. AI still needs data and uses it for learning patterns and making decisions; privacy will always remain an issue (Mhlanga, 2021). On the one hand, it is a fact that AI systems are associated with various human rights issues, which can be evaluated from case to case. AI has many complex pre-existing impacts regarding human rights because it is not installed or implemented against a blank slate but as a backdrop of societal conditions. Among many human rights that international law assures, privacy is impacted by it (Levin, 2018). From the discussed review, we draw the following hypothesis.
H1: There is a significant impact of artificial intelligence on the security and privacy issues
Making humans lazyAI is a technology that significantly impacts Industry 4.0, transforming almost every aspect of human life and society (Jones, 2014). The rising role of AI in organizations and individuals feared the persons like Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking. Who thinks it is possible when AI reaches its advanced level, there is a risk it might be out of control for humans (Clark et al., 2018). It is alarming that research increased eight times compared to the other sectors. Most firms and countries invest in capturing and growing AI technologies, skills, and education (Oh et al., 2017). Yet the primary concern of AI adoption is that it complicates the role of AI in sustainable value creation and minimizes human control (Noema, 2021).When the usage and dependency of AI are increased, this will automatically limit the human brain’s thinking capacity. This, as a result, rapidly decreases the thinking capacity of humans. This removes intelligence capacities from humans and makes them more artificial. In addition, so much interaction with technology has pushed us to think like algorithms without understanding (Sarwat, 2018). Another issue is the human dependency on AI technology in almost every walk of life. Undoubtedly, it has improved living standards and made life easier, but it has impacted human life miserably and made humans impatient and lazy (Krakauer, 2016). It will slowly and gradually starve the human brain of thoughtfulness and mental efforts as it gets deep into each activity, like planning and organizing. High-level reliance on AI may degrade professional skills and generate stress when physical or brain measures are needed (Gocen and Aydemir, 2020).AI is minimizing our autonomous role, replacing our choices with its choices, and making us lazy in various walks of life (Danaher, 2018). It is argued that AI undermines human autonomy and responsibilities, leading to a knock-out effect on happiness and fulfilment (C. Eric, 2019). The impact will not remain on a specific group of people or area but will also encompass the education sector. Teachers and students will use AI applications while doing a task/assignment, or their work might be performed automatically. Progressively, getting an addiction to AI use will lead to laziness and a problematic situation in the future. To summarize the review, the following hypothesis is made:
H2: There is a significant impact of artificial intelligence on human laziness
Loss of human decision-makingTechnology plays an essential role in decision-making. It helps humans use information and knowledge properly to make suitable decisions for their organization and innovations (Ahmad, 2019). Humans are producing large volumes of data, and to make it efficient, firms are adopting and using AI and kicking humans out of using the data. Humans think they are getting benefits and saving time by using AI in their decisions. But it is overcoming the human biological processors through lowing cognition capabilities (Jarrahi, 2018).It is a fact that AI technologies and applications have many benefits. Still, AI technologies have severe negative consequences, and the limitation of their role in human decision-making is one of them. Slowly and gradually, AI limits and replaces the human role in decision-making. Human mental capabilities like intuitive analysis, critical thinking, and creative problem-solving are getting out of decision-making (Ghosh et al., 2019). Consequently, this will lead to their loss as there is a saying, use it or lose it. The speed of adaptation of AI technology is evident from the usage of AI in the strategic decision-making processes, which has increased from 10 to 80% in five years (Sebastian and Sebastian, 2021).Walmart and Amazon have integrated AI into their recruitment process and make decisions about their product. And it’s getting more into the top management decisions (Libert, 2017). Organizations use AI to analyze data and make complex decisions effectively to obtain a competitive advantage. Although AI is helping the decision-making process in various sectors, humans still have the last say in making any decision. It highlights the importance of humans’ role in the process and the need to ensure that AI technology and humans work side by side (Meissner and Keding, 2021). The hybrid model of the human–machine collaboration approach is believed to merge in the future (Subramaniam, 2022).The role of AI in decision-making in educational institutions is spreading daily. Universities are using AI in both academic and administrative activities. From students searching for program admission requirements to the issuance of degrees, they are now assisted by AI personalization, tutoring, quick responses, 24/7 access to learning, answering questions, and task automation are the leading roles AI plays in the education sector (Karandish, 2021).In all the above roles, AI collects data, analyzes it, and then responds, i.e., makes decisions. It is necessary to ask some simple but essential questions: Does AI make ethical choices? The answer is AI was found to be racist, and its choice might not be ethical (Tran, 2021). The second question is, does AI impact human decision-making capabilities? While using an intelligent system, applicants may submit their records directly to the designer and get approval for admission tests without human scrutiny. One reason is that the authorities will trust the system; the second may be the laziness created by task automation among the leaders.Similarly, in keeping the records of students and analyzing their data, again, the choice will be dependent on the decision made by the system, either due to trust or due to the laziness created by task automation among the authorities. Almost in every task, the teachers and other workers lose the power of cognition while making academic or administrative decisions. And their dependency increases daily on the AI systems installed in the institution. To summarize the review, in any educational organization, AI makes operations automatic and minimizes staff participation in performing various tasks and making decisions. The teachers and other administrative staff are helpless in front of AI as the machines perform many of their functions. They are losing the skills of traditional tasks to be completed in an educational setting and consequently losing the reasoning capabilities of decision-making.
H3: There is a significant impact of artificial intelligence with the loss of human decision making
Conceptual frameworkFig. 1Fig. 1: Proposed model.The impact of artificial intelligence on human loss in decision making, laziness, and safety in education.Full size imageMethodologyResearch designThe research philosophy focuses on the mechanism of beliefs and assumptions regarding knowledge development. It is precisely what the researcher works on while conducting research and mounting expertise in a particular area. In this research, the positivist philosophy of analysis is used. Positivism focuses on an observable social reality that produces the laws, just like generalizations. This philosophy uses the existing theory for hypotheses development in this study.Furthermore, this philosophy is used because this study is about measurable and quantifiable data. The quantitative method is followed for data collection and analysis in this research. The quantitative practice focuses on quantifiable numbers and provides a systematic approach to assessing incidences and their associations. Moreover, while carrying out this study, the author evaluated the validity and reliability tools to ensure rigor in data. The primary approach is used because the data collected in this research is first-hand, which means it is collected directly from the respondents.Sample and sampling techniquesThe purposive sampling technique was used in this study for the primary data collection. This technique is used because it targets a small number of participants to participate in the survey, and their feedback shows the entire population (Davies and Hughes, 2014). Purposive sampling is a recognized non-probabilistic sampling technique because the author chose the participants based on the study’s purpose. The respondents of this study were students at different universities in Pakistan and China. Following the ethical guidelines, consent was taken from the participants. After that, they were asked to give their responses through a questionnaire. The number of participants who took part in the study was 285. This data collection was around two months, from 4 July 2022 to 31 August 2022.MeasuresThe survey instrument is divided into two parts. The initial portion of the questionnaire comprised demographic questions that included gender, age, country, and educational level. The second portion of the instrument had the Likert scale questions of the latent variables. This study model is composed of four latent variables. All four latent variables are measured through their developed Likert scale questions. All five measures of the latent variables are adopted from the different past studies that have developed and validated these scales. The measures of artificial intelligence are composed of seven items adopted from the study of Suh and Ahn (2022). The loss measures in decision-making consist of five items adopted from the study of Niese (2019). The measures of safety and security issues are composed of five items adopted from the study of Youn (2009). The measure of human laziness comprises four items adopted from the study of Dautov (2020). All of them are measured on the Likert scale of five, one for the least level of agreement and five for the highest level of agreement. Table 1 shows the details of the items of each construct.Table 1 Measures.Full size tableCommon method biasCMB is a major problem faced by the researcher working on the primary survey data research. There are many causes for this dilemma. The primary reason is the response tendency, in which the respondents of the research rate equally to all questions (Jordan and Troth, 2020). A model’s VIF values are not limited to multi-collinearity diagnostics but also indicate the common method bias (Kock, 2015). If the VIF values of the individual items present in the model are equal to or <3.3, then it is considered that the model is free from the common method bias. Table 2 shows that all the VIF values are <3.3, which indicates that the data collected by the primary survey is almost free from the issues of common bias.Table 2 Multicollinearity statistics.Full size tableReliability and validity of the dataReliability and validity confirm the health of the instrument and survey data for further analysis. Two tools are used in structural equation modeling for reliability: item reliability and construct reliability. The outer loading of each item gauges the item’s reliability. Its threshold value is 0.706, but in some cases, even 0.5 is also acceptable if the basic assumption of the convergent validity is not violated (Hair and Alamer, 2022). Cronbach’s Alpha and composite reliability are the most used tools to measure construct reliability. The threshold value is 0.7 (Hair Jr et al., 2021). Table 3 shows that all the items of each construct have outer loading values greater than 0.7. Only one item of artificial intelligence and one item of decision making is below 0.7 but within the minimum limit of 0.4, and both AVE values are also good. While each construct Cronbach’s alpha and composite reliability values are >0.7, both measures of reliability, item reliability, and construct reliability are established. For the validity of the data, there are also two measures used one is convergent validity, and the other is discriminant validity. For convergent validity, AVE values are used. The threshold value for the AVE is 0.5 (Hair and Alamer, 2022). From the table of reliability and validity, all the constructs have AVE values >0.5, indicating that all the constructs are convergently valid.Table 3 Reliability and validity.Full size tableIn Smart-PLS, three tools are used to measure discriminant validity: the Farnell Larker criteria, HTMT ratios, and the cross-loadings of the items. The threshold value for the Farnell Licker criteria is that the diagonal values of the table must be greater than the values of its corresponding rows and columns. Table 4 shows that all the diagonal values of the square root of the AVE are greater than their corresponding values of both columns and rows. The threshold value for the HTMT values is 0.85 or less (Joe F. Hair Jr et al., 2020). Table 5 shows that all the values are less than 0.85. Table 6 shows that they must have self-loading with their construct values greater than the cross-loading with other constructs. Table 6 shows that all the self-loadings are greater than the cross-loadings. All three above measures of discriminant validity show that the data is discriminately valid.Table 4 Fornell Larcker criteria.Full size tableTable 5 HTMT values.Full size tableTable 6 Cross-loadings.Full size tableResults and discussionDemographic profile of the respondentsTable 7 shows the demographic characteristics of the respondents. Among 285 respondents, 164 (75.5%) are male, while 121 (42.5%) are female. The data was collected from different universities in China and Pakistan. The table shows that 142 (50.2%) are Chinese students, and 141 (49.8%) are Pakistani students. The age group section shows that the students are divided into three age groups, <20 years, 20–25 years, and 26 years and above. Most students belong to the age group 20–25 years, which is 140 (49.1%), while 26 (9.1%) are <20 years old and 119 (41.8%) are 26 years and above. The fourth and last section of the table shows the program of the student’s studies. According to this, 149 (52.3%) students are undergraduates, 119 (41.8%) are graduates, and 17 (6%) are post-graduates.Table 7 Demographic distribution of respondents.Full size tableStructural modelThe structural model explains the relationships among study variables. The proposed structural model is exhibited in Fig. 2.Fig. 2Results model for the Impact of artificial intelligence on human loss in decision-making, laziness, and safety in education.Full size imageRegression analysisTable 8 shows the total direct relationships in the model. The first direct relationship is between artificial intelligence to loss in human decision-making, with a beta value of 0.277. The beta value shows that one unit increase in artificial intelligence will lose human decision-making by 0.277 units among university students in Pakistan and China. This relationship having the t value of 5.040, greater than the threshold value of 1.96, and a p-value of 0.000, <0.05, shows that the relationship is statistically significant. The second relationship is between artificial intelligence the human laziness. The beta value for this relationship is 0.689, which shows that one unit increase in artificial intelligence will make the students of Pakistan and China universities lazy by 0.689 units. The t-value for the relationship is 23.257, which is greater than the threshold value of 1.96, and a p-value of 0.000, which is smaller than the threshold value of 0.05, which shows that this relationship is also statistically significant. The third and last relationship is from artificial intelligence to security and privacy issues of Pakistani and Chinese university students. The beta value for this relationship is 0.686, which shows that a one-unit increase in artificial intelligence will increase security and privacy issues by 0.686. The t-value for the relationship is 17.105, which is greater than the threshold value of 1.96, and the p-value is 0.000, which is smaller than a threshold value of 0.05, indicating that this relationship is also statistically significant.Table 8 Regression analysis.Full size tableHypothesis testingTable 8 also indicates that the results support all three hypotheses.Model fitnessOnce the reliability and validity of the measurement model are confirmed, the structural model fitness must be assessed in the next step. For the model fitness, several measures are available in the SmartPLS, like SRMR, Chi-square, NFI, etc., but most of the researcher recommends the SRMR for the model fitness in the PLS-SEM. When applying PLS-SEM, a value <0.08 is generally considered a good fit (Hu and Bentler, 1998). However, the table of model fitness shows that the SRMR value is 0.06, which is less than the threshold value of 0.08, which indicates that the model is fit.Predictive relevance of the modelTable 9 shows the model’s prediction power, as we know that the model has total dependent variables. Then there are three predictive values for the model for each variable. The threshold value for predicting the model power is greater than zero. However, Q2 values of 0.02, 0.15, and 0.35, respectively, indicate that an independent variable of the model has a low, moderate, or high predictive relevance for a certain endogenous construct (Hair et al., 2013). Human laziness has the highest predictive relevance, with a Q2 value of 0.338, which shows a moderate effect. Safety and security issues have the second largest predictive relevance with the Q2 value of 0.314, which also show a moderate effect. The last and smallest predictive relevance in decision-making with a Q2 value of 0.033 which shows a low effect. A greater Q2 value shows that the variable or model has the highest prediction power.Table 9 IPMA analysis.Full size tableImportance performance matrix analysis (IPMA)Table 10 shows the importance and performance of each independent variable for the dependent variables. We see that artificial intelligence has the same performance of 68.78% for all three variables: human laziness, decision-making, safety, and security. While the importance of artificial intelligence, human laziness is 68.9%, loss in decision-making is 25.1%, and safety and security are 74.6%. This table shows that safety and privacy have the highest importance, and their performance is recommended to be increased to meet the important requirements. Figures 3–5 also show all three variables’ importance compared to performance with artificial intelligence.Table 10 Multi-group (analysis of gender)a.Full size tableFig. 3Importance-performance map—human loss in decision making and artificial intelligence.Full size imageFig. 4Importance-performance map—human laziness and artificial intelligence.Full size imageFig. 5Importance-performance map—safety and privacy and artificial intelligence.Full size imageMulti-group analysis (MGA)Multigroup analysis is a technique in structural equation modeling that compares the effects of two classes of categorical variables on the model’s relationships. The first category is gender, composed of male and female subgroups or types. Table 10 shows the gender comparison for all three relationships. The data record shows that there were 164 males and 121 females. The p-values of all three relationships are >0.05, which shows that gender is not moderate in any of the relationships. Table 10 shows the country-wise comparison for all three relationships in the model. The p-values of all three relationships are >0.05, indicating no moderating effect of the country on all three relationships. The data records show 143 Pakistanis and 142 Chinese based on the country’s origin.DiscussionAI is becoming an increasingly important element of our lives, with its impact felt in various aspects of our daily life. Like any other technological advancement, there are both benefits and challenges. This study examined the association of AI with human loss in decision-making, laziness and safety and privacy concerns. The results given Tables 11 and 12 show that AI has a significant positive relationship with all these variables. The findings of this study also support that the use of AI technologies is creating problems for users related to security and privacy. Previous research has also shown similar results (Bartoletti, 2019; Saura et al., 2022; Bartneck et al., 2021). Using AI technology in an educational organization also leads to security and privacy issues for students, teachers, and institutions. In today’s information age, security and privacy are critical concerns of AI technology use in educational organizations (Kamenskih, 2022). Skills specific to using AI technology are required for its effective use. Insufficient knowledge about the use will lead to security and privacy issues (Vazhayil and Shetty, 2019). Mostly, educational firms do not have AI technology experts in managing it, which again increases its vulnerability in the context of security and privacy issues. Even if its users have sound skills and the firms have experienced AI managers, no one can deny that any security or privacy control could be broken by mistake and could lead to serious security and privacy problems. Moreover, the fact that people with different levels of skills and competence interact in educational organizations also leads to the hacking or leaking of personal and institutional data (Kamenskih, 2022). AI is based on algorithms and uses large data sets to automate instruction (Araujo et al., 2020). Any mistake in the algorithms will create serious problems, and unlike humans, it will repeat the same mistake in making its own decisions. It also increases the threat to institutional and student data security and privacy. The same challenge is coming from the student end. They can be easily victimized as they are not excellently trained to use AI (Asaro, 2019). With the increase in the number of users, competence division and distance, safety and privacy concerns increase (Lv and Singh, 2020). The consequences depend upon the nature of the attack and the data been leaked or used by the attackers (Vassileva, 2008).Table 11 Model fitness.Full size tableTable 12 Predictive relevance of the model.Full size tableThe findings show that AI-based products and services are increasing the human laziness factor among those relying more on AI. However, there were not too many studies conducted on this factor by the researcher in the past, but the numerous researchers available in the literature also endorse the findings of this study (Farrow, 2022; Bartoletti, 2019). AI in education leads to the creation of laziness in humans. AI performs repetitive tasks in an automated manner and does not let humans memorize, use analytical mind skills, or use cognition (Nikita, 2023). It leads to an addiction behavior not to use human capabilities, thus making humans lazy. Teachers and students who use AI technology will slowly and gradually lose interest in doing tasks themselves. This is another important concern of AI in the education sector (Crispin Andrews). The teachers and students are getting lazy and losing their decision-making abilities as much of the work is assisted or replaced by AI technology (BARON, 2023). Posner and Fei-Fei (2020) suggested it is time to change AI for education.The findings also show that the access use of AI will gradually lead to the loss of human decision-making power. The results also endorsed the statement that AI is one of the major causes of the human loss of decision-making power. Several researchers from the past have also found that AI is a major cause responsible for the gradual loss of people’s decision-making (Pomerol, 1997; Duan et al., 2019; Cukurova et al., 2019). AI performs repetitive tasks in an automated manner and does not let humans memorize, use analytical mind skills, or use cognition, leading to the loss of decision-making capabilities (Nikita, 2023). An online environment for education can be a good option (VanLangen, 2021), but the classroom’s physical environment is the prioritized education mode (Dib and Adamo, 2014). In a real environment, there is a significant level of interaction between the teacher and students, which develop the character and civic bases of the students, e.g., students can learn from other students, ask teachers questions, and even feel the education environment. Along with the curriculum, they can learn and adopt many positive understandings (Quinlan et al., 2014). They can learn to use their cognitive power to choose options, etc. But unfortunately, the use of AI technology minimizes the real-time physical interaction (Mantello et al., 2021) and the education environment between students and teachers, which has a considerable impact on students’ schooling, character, civic responsibility, and their power to make decisions, i.e., use their cognition. AI technology reduces the cognitive power of humans who make their own decisions (Hassani and Unger, 2020).AI technology has undoubtedly transformed or at least affected many fields (IEEE, 2019; Al-Ansi and Al-Ansi, 2023). Its applications have been developed for the benefit of humankind (Justin and Mizuko, 2017). As technology assists employees in many ways, they must be aware of the pros and cons of the technology and must know its applications in a particular field (Nadir et al., 2012). Technology and humans are closely connected; the success of one is strongly dependent on the other; therefore, there is a need to ensure the acceptance of technology for human welfare (Ho et al., 2022). Many researchers have discussed the user’s perception of a technology (Vazhayil and Shetty, 2019), and many have emphasized its legislative and regulatory issues (Khan et al., 2014). Therefore, careful selection is necessary to adopt or implement any technology (Ahmad and Shahid, 2015). Once imagined in films, AI now runs a significant portion of the technology, i.e., health, transport, space, and business. As AI enters the education sector, it has been affected to a greater extent (Hübner, 2021). AI further strengthened its role in education, especially during the recent COVID-19 pandemic, and invaded the traditional way of teaching by providing many opportunities to educational institutions, teachers, and students to continue their educational processes (Štrbo, 2020; Al-Ansi, 2022; Akram et al., 2021). AI applications/technology like chatbots, virtual reality, personalized learning systems, social robots, tutoring systems, etc., assist the educational environment in facing modern-day challenges and shape education and learning processes (Schiff, 2021). In addition, it is also helping with administrative tasks like admission, grading, curriculum setting, and record-keeping, to name a few (Andreotta and Kirkham, 2021). It can be said that AI is likely to affect, enter and shape the educational process on both the institutional and student sides to a greater extent (Xie et al., 2021). This phenomenon hosts some questions regarding the ethical concerns of AI technology, its implementation, and its impact on universities, teachers, and students.The study has similar findings to the report published by the Harvard Kennedy School, where AI concerns like privacy, automation of tasks, and decision-making are discussed. It says that AI is not the solution to government problems but helps enhance efficiency. It is important to note that the report does not deny the role of AI but highlights the issues. Another study says that AI-based and human decisions must be combined for more effective decisions. i.e., the decisions made by AI must be evaluated and checked, and the best will be chosen by humans from the ones recommended by AI (Shrestha et al., 2019). The role of AI cannot be ignored in today’s technological world. It assists humans in performing complex tasks, providing solutions to many complex problems, assisting in decision-making, etc. But on the other hand, it is replacing humans, automating tasks, etc., which creates challenges and demands for a solution (Duan et al., 2019). People are generally concerned about risks and have conflicting opinions about the fairness and effectiveness of AI decision-making, with broad perspectives altered by individual traits (Araujo et al. 2020).There may be many reasons for these controversial findings, but the cultural factor was considered one of the main factors (Elliott, 2019). According to researchers, people with high cultural values have not adopted the AI problem, so this cultural constraint remains a barrier for the AI to influence their behaviors (Di Vaio et al., 2020; Mantelero, 2018). The other thing is that privacy is a term that has a different meaning from culture to culture (Ho et al., 2022). In some cultures, people consider minimal interference in personal life a big privacy issue, while in some cultures, people even ignore these types of things (Mantello et al., 2021). The results are similar to Zhang et al. (2022), Aiken and Epstein (2000), and Bhbosale et al. (2020), which focus on the ethical issues of AI in education. These studies show that AI use in education is the reason for laziness among students and teachers. In short, the researchers are divided on the AI concerns in education, just like in other sectors. But they agree on the positive role AI plays in education. AI in education leads to laziness, loss of decision-making capabilities, and security or privacy issues. But all these issues can be minimized if AI is properly implemented, managed, and used in education.ImplicationsThe research has important implications for technology developers, the organization that adopts the technology, and the policymakers. The study highlights the importance of addressing ethical concerns during AI technology’s development and implementation stage. It also provides guidelines for the government and policymakers regarding the issues arising with AI technology and its implementation in any organization, especially in education. AI can revolutionize the education sector, but it has some potential drawbacks. Implications suggest that we must be aware of the possible impact of AI on laziness, decision-making, privacy, and security and that we should design AI systems that have a very minimal impact.
Managerial Implications
Those associated with the development and use of AI technology in education need to find out the advantages and challenges of AI in this sector and balance these advantages with the challenges of laziness, decision-making, and privacy or security while protecting human creativity and intuition. AI systems should be designed to be transparent and ethical in all manners. Educational organizations should use AI technology to assist their teachers in their routine activities, not to replace them.
Theoretical Implications
A loss of human decision-making capacity is one of the implications of AI in education. Since AI systems are capable of processing enormous amounts of data and producing precise predictions, there is a risk that humans would become overly dependent on AI in making decisions. This may reduce critical thinking and innovation for both students and teachers, which could lower the standard of education. Educators should be aware of how AI influences decision-making processes and must balance the benefits of AI with human intuition and creativity. AI may potentially affect school security. AI systems can track student behavior, identify potential dangers, and identify situations where children might require more help. There are worries that AI could be applied to unjustly target particular student groups or violate students’ privacy. Therefore, educators must be aware of the potential ethical ramifications of AI and design AI systems that prioritize security and privacy for users and educational organizations. AI makes people lazier is another potential impact on education. Teachers and learners may become more dependent on AI systems and lose interest in performing activities or learning new skills or methodologies. This might lead to a decline in educational quality and a lack of personal development among people. Therefore, teachers must be aware of the possible detrimental impacts of AI on learners’ motivation and should create educational environments that motivate them to participate actively in getting an education.
ConclusionAI can significantly affect the education sector. Though it benefits education and assists in many academic and administrative tasks, its concerns about the loss of decision-making, laziness, and security may not be ignored. It supports decision-making, helps teachers and students perform various tasks, and automates many processes. Slowly and gradually, AI adoption and dependency in the education sector are increasing, which invites these challenges. The results show that using AI in education increases the loss of human decision-making capabilities, makes users lazy by performing and automating the work, and increases security and privacy issues.Recommendations

Like other sectors, education also adopts AI technologies to address modern-day challenges. AI investment will grow to USD 253.82 million from 2021 to 2025. However, worryingly, researchers and institutions across the globe are praising the positive role of AI but ignoring its concerns. This study is based on qualitative methodology using PLS-Smart for the data analysis. Primary data was collected from 285 students from different universities in Pakistan and China. The purposive Sampling technique was used to draw the sample from the population. The data analysis findings show that AI significantly impacts the loss of human decision-making and makes humans lazy. It also impacts security and privacy. The findings show that 68.9% of laziness in humans, 68.6% in personal privacy and security issues, and 27.7% in the loss of decision-making are due to the impact of artificial intelligence in Pakistani and Chinese society. From this, it was observed that human laziness is the most affected area due to AI. However, this study argues that significant preventive measures are necessary before implementing AI technology in education. Accepting AI without addressing the major human concerns would be like summoning the devils. Concentrating on justified designing and deploying and using AI for education is recommended to address the issue.', 'datePublished': '2023-06-09T00:00:00Z', 'dateModified': '2023-06-29T00:00:00Z', 'pageStart': '1', 'pageEnd': '14', 'license': 'http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/', 'sameAs': 'https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-01787-8', 'keywords': ['Education', 'Information systems and information technology', 'Science', 'Humanities and Social Sciences', 'multidisciplinary'], 'image': ['https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1057%2Fs41599-023-01787-8/MediaObjects/41599_2023_1787_Fig1_HTML.png', 'https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1057%2Fs41599-023-01787-8/MediaObjects/41599_2023_1787_Fig2_HTML.png', 'https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1057%2Fs41599-023-01787-8/MediaObjects/41599_2023_1787_Fig3_HTML.png', 'https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1057%2Fs41599-023-01787-8/MediaObjects/41599_2023_1787_Fig4_HTML.png', 'https://media.springernature.com/lw1200/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1057%2Fs41599-023-01787-8/MediaObjects/41599_2023_1787_Fig5_HTML.png'], 'isPartOf': {'name': 'Humanities and Social Sciences Communications', 'issn': ['2662-9992'], 'volumeNumber': '10', '@type': ['Periodical', 'PublicationVolume']}, 'publisher': {'name': 'Palgrave Macmillan UK', 'logo': {'url': 'https://www.springernature.com/app-sn/public/images/logo-springernature.png', '@type': 'ImageObject'}, '@type': 'Organization'}, 'author': [{'name': 'Sayed Fayaz Ahmad', 'affiliation': [{'name': 'Institute of Business Management', 'address': {'name': 'Institute of Business Management, Karachi, Pakistan', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}], 'email': 'fayaz.ahmed@iobm.edu.pk', '@type': 'Person'}, {'name': 'Heesup Han', 'url': 'http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6356-3001', 'affiliation': [{'name': 'Sejong University', 'address': {'name': 'Sejong University, Seoul, Korea', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}], 'email': 'heesup.han@gmail.com', '@type': 'Person'}, {'name': 'Muhammad Mansoor Alam', 'affiliation': [{'name': 'Riphah International University', 'address': {'name': 'Riphah International University, Islamabad, Pakistan', '@type': 'PostalAddress'}, '@type': 'Organization'}], '@type': 'Person'}, {'name': 'Mohd.

The game-changing release of ChatGPT has everyone talking about — and worried about — how generative AI will change the way we work. With every new technology, there are disruptions to the job market, but something feels different about ChatGPT and similar programs like Google Bard and Microsoft Bing AI.
Generative AI is a new type of artificial intelligence (AI) that uses algorithms to generate original text, images, software code, Excel formulas and even music from a simple text prompt. Generative AI applications like ChatGPT have been ""trained"" on massive amounts of data and can produce human-quality content in seconds.

So, the question is: Will your job be replaced by AI?

AI's Impact on the Job Market


8 Jobs Most Threatened by AI


8 Jobs Least Threatened by AI








AI's Impact on the Job Market
 

According to a 2023 report from Goldman Sachs, the labor markets in both the United States and Europe could ""face significant disruption"" if generative AI lives up to the hype. As much as a quarter of current jobs could be fully replaced by AI, and two-thirds of all jobs — or 300 million jobs — will be impacted by AI automation in ways both large and small.
The good news is that changes in the job market move slowly, says Tom Davenport, a professor of IT and management at Babson College in Massachusetts and author of several best-selling books on AI in the workplace, including ""All in on AI: How Smart Companies Win Big with Artificial Intelligence.""


Advertisement  


""In general, these AI tools will eat away at the margins of jobs, automating certain tasks,"" says Davenport. ""And even if those tasks are taken over completely, there's still a need for a human in the loop.""
That's not to say that some jobs won't disappear entirely and maybe faster than you think, says Martin Ford, futurist and author of ""Rule of the Robots: How Artificial Intelligence Will Transform Everything.""
""Here's a question to ask yourself: Do you have the kind of job where another person could study a record of everything you've done and figure out how to do your job?"" asks Martin. ""If the answer is yes, then your job will be susceptible.""

8 Jobs Most Threatened by AI
 

The advent of generative AI has shifted the target of automation from blue-collar to white-collar workers.
""In order to automate a knowledge-based job, you don't need a robot or any expensive machinery,"" says Ford. ""All you need is software, an algorithm. That's what ChatGPT in particular has really brought into focus.""


Advertisement  

We've put together a list (in no particular order) of the eight jobs that AI experts predict will be the most vulnerable to AI automation and eight that are far harder to replace with supersmart machines ─ for now at least...
1. Content Marketers
There's an entire industry dedicated to marketing products and services through web articles, videos and social media posts. Digital marketers write blog posts, produce videos and maintain social media channels for both large corporations and mom-and-pop shops. But that type of targeted content is exactly what generative AI is designed to create.
Ford puts it bluntly: ""Content marketers are in trouble.""
There are already powerful applications like Jasper, an AI that pumps out snappy articles, personalized emails and timely Twitter posts with the push of a button. Even better (or worse), Jasper automates many of the other tasks that are part of a content marketing campaign, like A/B testing and search engine optimization.
Davenport says the people who should be the most worried are marketers who specialize in ""low-quality content"" that doesn't require a lot of original thinking. ""By definition, AI can only produce stuff that's a variation of what's already out there,"" says Davenport. ""If you want anything novel at all, you'll still have to turn to a human.""
2. Beat Journalists
Certain types of journalism are already being replaced by AI. Sports reporting, in particular, lends itself easily to automation. An algorithm can look at a box score from a baseball or basketball game — which players scored and when, how the winning team took the lead — and churn out a 500-word article that tells a compelling and accurate story.
The same is true for some types of financial journalism, like quarterly announcements of earnings reports and other business data. Since 2014, The Associated Press has partnered with an AI platform called Automated Insights to publish thousands of earnings report articles a year without a single human journalist. The Associated Press said that doing this had allowed business reporters 20 percent more time that could be used to do deeper stories.
The same AI program automated The AP's 2018 coverage of NCAA basketball. Automated news was also used for election results and updating statistics during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to do ""explainer""-type pieces, though many AI-produced articles have been found to have errors.
""Anyone who has a job where they sit in front of a computer and do something fairly predictable again and again, even if that involves skilled writing, is going to be highly susceptible to automation,"" says Ford.
3. Graphic Artists

If you think that all creative and artistic work is immune from automation, you haven't met DALL-E 2 from OpenAI, the brains behind ChatGPT. DALL-E 2 generates images the same way that ChatGPT generates text. Type in a prompt — like ""create a business card for a flower shop called Daisy Mae's"" — and DALL-E 2 will create dozens of different business card designs instantly. The results, according to one professional graphic designer, are ""insane"" (in a good/scary way).
Graphic designers can look at applications like DALL-E 2 in one of two ways: They can see it as an existential threat that's going to render human designers obsolete; or they can use tools like DALL-E 2 to quickly generate visual ideas that can be perfected through human artistry.
Yes, generative AI is going to replace graphic artists who specialize in quick-and-dirty designs, but there will always be a market for higher-end work.
Just ask Jason Allen, a Colorado video game designer who won a ""digitally manipulated photography"" contest using an AI image generator called Midjourney. Allen didn't just punch in a prompt; he spent 80 hours making more than 900 versions of his digital masterpiece. While the win generated a lot of online hate for ""cheating,"" Allen told The Washington Post, the AI ""is a tool, just like the paintbrush is a tool. Without the person, there is no creative force.""





4. Data Analysts
In our digital world, companies and organizations are drowning in data: sales figures, demographic data, climate models, you name it. It's the job of data analysts to sift through all that data, identify hidden trends and make actionable recommendations.
Not all of that work is glamorous. A big part of a data analyst's job is selecting fields and filters, and figuring out the best spreadsheet formulas for slicing and dicing the data. The good (and bad) news is that AI can now do much of that time-consuming labor.
As with many other job sectors, there will continue to be a need for high-level analysis and decision making, says Davenport, ""but lower-level data analysis — like financial modeling in investment banking and private equity — a lot of that could be taken over by AI.""
5. Programmers and Coders
Most experts agree that generative AI will be a boon for software developers. With AI tools like Copilot, programmers don't have to painstakingly code line after line from scratch. Just type in a prompt and the algorithm can generate high-quality code in multiple coding languages.
According to a paper from Microsoft and MIT, software developers who used Copilot were able to write a program 56 percent faster than traditional coders. In the tech industry, where mass layoffs have already culled the workforce, coders are rightfully concerned that entry-level programming jobs will be replaced by AI.
For the software developers who keep their jobs, many will take on new roles as ""prompt engineers,"" people with a knack for entering the best prompts into the automated coding apps.
6. Lawyers
""AI will have a big impact in law,"" says Ford. ""AI and other types of legal software are already transforming the discovery process, figuring out which documents are relevant to a case."" AI is also handling a lot of contract generation and contract analysis.
Again, it's the time-consuming, repetitive, low-level legal work that will be automated first, so there will be less of a need for entry-level lawyers, but critics argue that AI will never replace the majority of what lawyers do. It will simply allow lawyers, like other professionals, to spend more time on big-picture thinking and less on the grunt work. (However, a lawyer who uses ChatGPT should double-check the cases it cites, as one attorney found out the hard way.)
On the plus side, automated legal services could provide a critical resource for low-income Americans, 86 percent of whom could not afford legal representation in civil cases, according to the American Bar Association.
7. Warehouse Workers
Over the past decade, Amazon has deployed more than 500,000 robots in its ""fulfillment centers,"" the massive warehouses where Amazon orders are collected, boxed and shipped out. At the same time, Amazon has hired more than a million human warehouse workers, arguing that maximum efficiency will be realized by humans and machines working together.
Meanwhile, Amazon is investing in robots that can do the nimble work of humans — visually identifying and grabbing small objects from mixed bins — so how long will it be before companies like Amazon can fully replace imperfect human warehouse workers who need breaks and keep threatening to unionize?
""You're going to see automation moving very rapidly in those controlled warehouse environments,"" says Ford. ""Within five years or so, there are going to be a lot fewer human employees within Amazon warehouses.""
8. Radiologists and Medical Diagnosticians
Way back in 2016, when ChatGPT was just a glimmer in its creators' eyes, the Turing Prize-winning computer scientist Goeffrey Hinton declared, ""We should stop training radiologists now.""
That's because smart machines running algorithms were already getting really good at identifying pathologies in X-rays, MRI scans and other medical imaging. In 2019, AI radiologists outperformed human doctors in identifying cancer in medical images, catching 5 percent more cancers and reducing false positives by 11 percent.
Does that mean that all radiologists are going to be replaced by AI in the next 10 years? Not exactly, says Davenport
""I subscribe to the theory that with all of these jobs, including radiology, the only people who are going to lose their jobs are the people who refuse to work with AI,"" says Davenport.

8 Jobs Least Threatened by AI
 

For all of the hype around generative AI, there are many jobs that are very difficult, if not impossible to automate.
1. Skilled Tradespeople
Think about all of the knowledge, dexterity and problem-solving skills required to be a certified plumber or electrician. Sure, there are routine jobs, but every situation brings unique and unexpected challenges, both physical and mental.


Advertisement  

Generative AI is impressive, and so are warehouse and factory robots, but to replicate the unique skills of a human plumber or electrician ""would require C3PO from 'Star Wars,'"" says Ford. ""To build a robot that could do that kind of job is science fiction.""
2. Construction
In the near future, much of the work that goes into designing and engineering buildings will be done with the help of AI software, but when it comes to hammering nails and laying bricks, the construction industry still needs plenty of old-fashioned muscle and human know-how.
More and more construction will be done on a modular basis, meaning that individual components will be produced in factories by 3D printers and other machines off-site, and then assembled on-site. But according to a report by McKinsey, only 15 to 20 percent of new construction will be modular by 2030.
""For those activities that do remain on-site, it's unlikely that a company will fire a carpenter and bring in the latest robot to do everything the carpenter did. Rather, machines will take over individual activities within a role. What that means is workers will need to learn to work side by side — or in a hybrid role — with machines,"" the report added.
3. Food Preparation and Serving

According to the Goldman Sachs report (Exhibit 8), at least half of the job tasks involved in cooking and serving food simply cannot be done by AI or robots. Compare that to the legal sector, where the report says that 40 percent of tasks can be fully replaced with AI and 60 percent can be at least complemented by machines.
That's not to say that automation won't make inroads into the food industry. The fast food chain White Castle already uses robots in some locations to flip burgers and cook fries. As with other services, Davenport believes that people are willing to sacrifice on the low-end. ""We don't care if a robot makes our hamburger at White Castle,"" he says, ""but if you go out to a really nice restaurant, you don't want the chef to be a robot.""
4. Psychology and Counseling
Once again, there are plenty of AI applications being designed for the counseling and mental health space — conversational AI chatbots are expected to be a $1.25 billion market by 2025.
But Ford says that while chatbot applications like Woebot can do basic mental health counseling — and can even guide users through exercises like cognitive behavioral therapy — they won't replace human therapists, nor are they designed to.
""For the foreseeable future, we're not going to see machines that have the kind of human interactions and relationship building skills that people have,"" says Ford.
Other health care jobs with deep human interaction, like nurses and doctors, are likely to remain un-replaced by AI.
5. Elementary School Teachers
Education is also being transformed by technology. Both Davenport and Ford point to exciting innovations like online learning and AI-powered tutoring apps that customize learning to the individual student. But again, there are inherent limitations to what an AI can do in the classroom, especially for teaching young children.
""At the preschool and elementary school level, there's a strong need for that human level of interaction,"" says Ford. ""Once the students get older, though, it becomes less important."" (Some would disagree, citing the role teachers play in continuing to inspire and guide students of all ages.)
Still, Ford sees a day when AI instructors in high school and college are ""outpacing what human teachers can do.""
6. Professional Athletes and Coaches
Will NBA fans be cheering on a robot Lebron James anytime soon? Not likely. The physical and mental prowess of professional athletes will be nearly impossible to replicate in a machine.
That's not to say that athletes and coaches aren't already benefiting from AI. There are applications that track each player's precise movements and make recommendations for improving performance and reducing injuries.
Moving forward, coaches will tap AI to identify the best recruits, analyze an opponent's defensive strategy and make targeted training recommendations for individual players. But like teachers and therapists, there's no replacement for the human factor of a good coach.
7. Drivers (For Now)
This might come as a surprise, since there's been so much hype about driverless cars. Aren't we just a few years away from self-driving Ubers and 18-wheelers putting all human cabbies and truck drivers out of business?
Both Davenport and Ford say no.
Sure, Waymo already offers driverless rides in a select area of downtown Phoenix, Arizona, with plans to expand to San Francisco and Los Angeles, but this technology is ""still far away from being pervasive,"" says Davenport, who has been hearing about the imminent takeover of driverless vehicles since the 1980s. ""The general feeling seems to be, we're 90 percent of the way there, but the last 10 percent will take a while.""
Ford agrees, citing the unpredictability of real-world driving and the liability it places on driverless car companies.
""Once you're out on a public road with pedestrians and bicyclists and dogs and cats, it's chaos,"" says Ford. ""There's no way to control that. That's been the challenge for self-driving cars on public roads.""
8. Truly Creative Thinkers
Entrepreneurs, inventors, authors and actors — those kinds of jobs will undoubtedly use generative AI as a tool, but ChatGPT by definition cannot ""think outside of the box."" Ford says that ""genuinely creative jobs"" are the safest ones to have in the age of AI.
Even if AI encroaches upon writing and art and music, Davenport believes that people will always be willing to pay a premium for ""human-generated activity,"" especially at the high end.
So, while AI can generate business earnings reports or election results, analysis of what it all means, or giving it a point of view, requires a human writer — at least for now.

Now That's Scary
Some AI experts, like Geoffrey Hinton who we quoted above, think we should be less worried about AI taking our jobs than taking our lives. Gulp.

Published: 07 Jun 2023


 
Mayo Clinic and Google Cloud today launched a new collaboration to transform healthcare with generative artificial intelligence (AI) by enhancing clinical workflows, assisting researchers and clinicians in searching for information, and improving patient outcomes.







These efforts will be supported by Google’s Enterprise Search in Generative AI App Builder (Gen App Builder), which the company stated is now ready to support HIPAA compliance.
Using the Gen App Builder, Mayo Clinic is exploring how generative AI-based enterprise search functionality can help clinicians and other staff gather information from across the health system. This task can be difficult, as data like EHRs, clinical guidelines, and research papers often used to support clinicians’ work can be stored in various formats and locations across the enterprise.
Google’s Gen App Builder is designed to unify these data and make them more efficient to access and interpret.
""Our prioritization of patient safety, privacy, and ethical considerations, means that generative AI can have a significant and positive impact on how we work and deliver healthcare,"" said Cris Ross, Mayo Clinic's Chief Information Officer, in the press release. ""Google Cloud's tools have the potential to unlock sources of information that typically aren't searchable in a conventional manner, or are difficult to access or interpret, from a patient's complex medical history to their imaging, genomics, and labs. Accessing insights more quickly and easily could drive more cures, create more connections with patients, and transform healthcare.""
The press release further notes that generative AI technology can enable healthcare organizations to automate repetitive tasks, streamline administration, and optimize workflows in new ways. Standard AI models can analyze huge amounts of data to identify patterns, which can then be used to flag inefficiencies and improve processes.
Generative AI allows organizations to analyze these data in more sophisticated ways, interpret and organize data, or generate new information, such as images, based on that data.
""Generative AI has the potential to transform healthcare by enhancing human interactions and automating operations like never before,"" said Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud. ""Mayo Clinic is a world leader in leveraging AI for good, and they are a critical partner as we identify responsible ways to bring this transformative technology to healthcare.""
The collaboration builds on an existing partnership between Google and Mayo Clinic, in addition to Google’s ongoing work on healthcare generative AI.
In March, the tech company shared updates on its health AI research as part of its annual health event, The Check Up.
During the event, Google announced improvements in its medical large language model (LLM), Med-PaLM, which achieved a passing score on USMLE-style open-ended and multiple-choice questions. The tool’s successor, Med-PaLM 2, later scored an 85 percent, performing at an ‘expert’ level.
The tool became available to select customers for limited testing in April.
The company also announced a formal agreement with Mayo Clinic to advance cancer radiotherapy through the use of AI, and a deep learning tool developed as a result of the partnership has seen promising results in a validation study published in April.

News Summary:

Powerful new generative AI features across Cisco’s Collaboration and Security portfolios will drive productivity and simplicity across the enterprise.
New generative AI-powered summarization capabilities in Webex by Cisco will increase productivity and help people do their best work.
Previews of new AI capabilities in Cisco Security Cloud will greatly simplify policy management and improve threat response.

CISCO LIVE, LAS VEGAS, June 7, 2023 – Today Cisco (CSCO) announced it is reimagining the way people work with new, powerful generative AI technology. Cisco will harness large language models (LLMs) across its Collaboration and Security portfolios to help organizations drive productivity and simplicity for their workforce.
Expectations are at an all-time high – organizations are grappling with how to deliver unrivaled experiences for hybrid workers, while safeguarding their businesses from sophisticated cyber threats.
According to Cisco’s 2023 State of Global Innovation Study, IT professionals rank generative AI as the technology most likely to have a significant impact on their business, with 85% of those saying they’re prepared for its impact. Cisco recognizes the important role generative AI will play in advancing the future of work and is committed to providing hybrid workers with an efficient, safer, and more productive, work experience.
“Generative AI will quickly become pervasive as we see businesses and workers embrace the technology to become materially more productive,” said Jeetu Patel, Executive Vice President and General Manager, Security and Collaboration, Cisco. “At Cisco, we’ve been using AI for years. Now we’re unveiling how we’re incorporating generative AI into our existing products, helping customers drive real value to unlock the most secure, unrivaled work experiences possible.”
New Summarization Capabilities in Webex by Cisco
With every work interaction being hybrid, employees, and customers need collaboration experiences that empower them to do their best work. Within the Webex Suite, new summarization capabilities that help people get up to speed in seconds will include:

“Catch Me Up” will allow users to quickly catch up on missed interactions, including meetings, calling, chats and more.
Intelligent meeting summaries with key points and action items. Users can opt in to automatically generate the most important elements of a Webex meeting, extract the key points, and capture action items with owners. This will be a huge time-saver for attendees and people unable to join a meeting – eliminating the need to listen to a recording or read through transcripts.
Summaries in Vidcast, the company's video messaging tool. This capability will produce highlights and chapters so viewers can navigate to the most important parts of the video quickly.
New conversation summaries in Webex Contact Center will provide agents with a fast, automated way to consume long-form text from digital chats with customers as well as facilitating post-call wrap-up and resolution with customers. For example, if a customer is escalated to a call with a human agent, they expect that agent to be informed and not have to repeat their frustrations. Chat summaries provides the agent with a clear summarization of issues and resolutions already explored via self-service and a summary of the call to both the agent and customer once it ends.

Moving Security from Complex to Conversational 
Cisco is investing in cutting-edge innovations in artificial intelligence and machine learning that will augment security staff by simplifying operations and increasing efficacy. Further delivering on its Security Cloud vision, Cisco is previewing new generative AI capabilities to simplify policy management and improve threat response.
Effective security policy creation and management is an oftentimes extremely complex but critical function of cybersecurity hygiene. There is little room for error and the process of making simple edits that won’t interfere with or override previous rules is extremely time consuming and technically challenging. The volume, inconsistency, and complexity of maintaining all of these policies across all of these systems creates a significant risk that opens the door for attacks.
The Cisco Security Cloud will leverage a generative AI Policy Assistant to address this problem by enabling security and IT administrators to describe granular security policies and evaluate how to best implement them across different aspects of their security infrastructure. 
This week's preview showed how the Cisco Policy Assistant can reason with the existing firewall policy set to implement and simplify rules within the Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center. It is the first of many examples of how generative AI can reimagine policy management across the Cisco Security Cloud.
Augmenting Analysts with Machine Speed and Scale 
Threat detection and response is another complex and high stakes responsibility of the security operations where time is of the essence and analysts must rapidly gain understanding of complex systems at machine scale.
Cisco’s security operations center (SOC) Assistant will augment security analysts with the context to make the right decisions at the right time. The SOC Assistant will provide a comprehensive situation analysis for analysts, correlating intel across the Cisco Security Cloud platform solutions, relaying potential impacts, and providing recommended actions. Significantly reducing the time needed for SOC teams to respond to potential threats.
Cisco will preview its generative AI solution for Webex and Security Cloud onstage at Cisco LIVE 2023. Webex summarization, policy management and SOC Assistant Summaries will be available by the end of calendar year 2023. The additional SOC Assistant features will be available in the first half of calendar 2024.
Cisco’s Approach to Generative AI 
For years, Cisco has leveraged AI with audio, video, natural language understanding, and analytics to create unrivaled experiences for Webex users – with the security Cisco is known for. New enhancements in LLM and generative AI are advancing this even further to deliver unrivaled hybrid work experiences. Webex has established a first set of principles, consisting of multi-modal support, permissions, privacy, and accuracy for its enterprise-grade AI. This includes only using data that individuals already have permission to access, based on the privacy and security rules of that specific data source.

The AI advantage: How Australia can lead with generative AIBy Muhammad Zulhusni






 
Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...Generative AI could add AU$115 billion annually to Australia’s economy by 2030.GAI can automate tasks, freeing professionals for complex work.Australia’s tech capabilities make it a potential global GAI leader.With the advantage of Generative AI (GAI), numerous work sectors are gaining momentum. GAI empowers software developers to translate natural language into code, democratizing the process of coding. Researchers can exploit this AI advantage to disentangle complex problems and construct research frameworks. In management, the advantage of generative AI can be leveraged for functions such as producing training materials, pinpointing employee sentiment trends, and analyzing performance data.A new report indicates that if Australia accelerates its responsible adoption of GAI, it could unlock billions in value for its professional and financial services sector by 2030. The report, titled ‘Australia’s Generative AI Opportunity,’ is a collaboration between Microsoft and the Tech Council of Australia. It estimates that by 2030, GAI could annually contribute between AU$45 billion and AU$115 billion to Australia’s economy. This would be achieved by improving existing industries and fostering the creation of new products and services.The report earmarks professional and financial services as one of four key sectors in the Australian economy that could benefit from GAI. It estimates that GAI could annually contribute between AU$5 billion and AU$13 billion to this sector in Australia by 2030.The economic opportunity of GAI in 2030. (Source – Microsoft and the Tech Council of Australia)  Unlocking the potential generative AI advantage for professional and financial servicesThe primary value proposition for GAI in the professional and financial services sector is its capacity to automate routine tasks, freeing up time for more high-value work. It could also elevate Australia’s reputation for exceptional knowledge workers and service delivery, especially within the legal and financial sectors.Howard Silby, NAB Executive for Innovation and Partnerships, observes that while AI technology has been around for a while, there’s a notable uptick in Gen AI tools’ popularity and adoption.AUSTRALIAN DATA CENTERS EXPAND INVESTMENTSMuhammad Zulhusni | 9 June, 2023Silby remarks, “Whilst we’ve been using AI tools for some time in areas including digital customer service, cyber security and financial crime, the opportunities for Gen AI to move our organization – and our industry – forward are significant. As a bank, it’s critical that we use AI for the benefit of our customers, and protecting their data has to be our first priority. That’s a key foundation for all the development around Gen AI that we put in place.”The report suggests that GAI could automate 36% and assist in 26% of an accountant’s tasks, allowing them to transition to a more advisory and strategic role. For solicitors, GAI could automate 10% of their tasks and augment 32%, freeing up time for more complex legal issues.GAI could also democratize access to professional services, such as legal and financial advice, for a broader Australian populace. It could help lawyers cater to more cases from underserved groups.Sam Kidd, CEO and Co-founder at LawVu, states that its mission is to accelerate global legal work. By partnering with Microsoft, the company can securely incorporate AI enhancements into the LawVu legal workspace, helping legal teams save time to focus on more critical matters. This ultimately results in improved business outcomes.Lee Hickin, Chief Technology Officer at Microsoft Australia and New Zealand, asserts that GAI has blossomed into a pivotal technology in 2023, with its adoption rapidly increasing across various Australian sectors.“Microsoft is committed to fostering closer collaboration between industry and government to ensure the nation can realize the potential economic benefits of generative AI, and do so responsibly. Building trust in this technology is critical to harnessing its innovative capabilities and enabling Australia to become a global leader in this space,” Hickin added.The report also highlights healthcare, manufacturing, and retail as other key sectors that could substantially benefit from GAI. It provides potential GAI use cases for these sectors and the possible economic value that could be generated from this technology.Generative AI presents a significant opportunity for growth in the Australian economy. (Source – Microsoft and the Tech Council of Australia)Australia’s preparedness for generative AI adoptionGAI is an emerging field full of potential, but it also brings significant uncertainties for those implementing and regulating it. Countries worldwide are taking measures to keep up with these advancements. For example, the US has established a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law to consult with experts on the economic and societal impacts of GAI. Similarly, the EU is developing its primary AI legislation, the EU Artificial Intelligence Act, to classify and regulate AI.Australia, in particular, is ready to align with global best practices. In 2019, the Federal Government launched an AI Ethics Framework to guide the responsible deployment of AI by businesses and the government. More recently, the CSIRO’s National AI Centre formed the Responsible AI Network (RAIN) to help the industry enhance AI governance capabilities.Given Australia’s advantages in digital innovation, the nation is ideally positioned to become a leader in the GAI field; here are some of the reasons why:Talent pool: Australia boasts a flourishing tech workforce of 935,000 as of February 2023, projected to reach 1.2 million by 2030. This burgeoning workforce, with adequate support from industry and government, could serve as a sturdy base for GAI development and adoption.Digital infrastructure investment: Australia’s substantial investments in digital infrastructure, including plans for the NBN to offer high-speed internet access to 10 million households and businesses by 2025, pave the way for broader GAI benefits, particularly in regional areas.Market connections: Australia’s geographical location offers strategic access to expanding Asian markets, while its strong ties with the US, solidified by the AUKUS partnership, offer a robust platform for global GAI development collaborations.Policy support: The Australian Government is committed to being a global frontrunner in the creation and adoption of trusted, secure, and responsible AI, with up to $41m already pledged for responsible AI deployment in the economy.The report, based on extensive economic analysis and consultations with industry, academia, and government, identifies four primary barriers to leveraging GAI: technology capability, enterprise readiness, awareness and skills, and responsible AI. It then proposes strategic actions for policymakers and adopters to overcome these obstacles and position Australia as a global GAI leader.These actions include defining GAI’s opportunity and vision, assessing readiness, incentivizing adoption and innovation, upskilling the workforce, and creating responsible AI governance frameworks.

Generative AI models offer impressive outputs but demand high computing power and a massive carbon footprint. Managing their inference costs is a significant barrier for organizations seeking to adopt generative AI on a larger scale, says Yonatan Geifman, Ph.D, CEO of Deci.
The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the creation of visually stunning imagery and captivating texts. However, the high operational costs associated with scaling generative AI models pose a significant challenge for organizations. These costs hinder widespread adoption, from the enormous computing power requirements to the resulting carbon footprint. This article explores the unique characteristics of generative AI and the need to address inference costs for successful deployment and scalability.
Strikingly aesthetic imagery and impressively worded texts can now be generated in no time by generative AI. 
The Challenge of Scaling Generative AI
New applications of generative AI models are bringing AI much closer to the consumer. But as helpful and entertaining as tools like Midjourney and Chat-GPT are, they come at a significantly high operational cost – including the exorbitant capital needed to finance their demanding computing power and the resultant massive carbon footprintOpens a new window . 
As is often the case early in the lifecycle of transformative technologies, these costs are proving to be a large barrier for organizations looking to deploy and scale generative AI, particularly as its use and inference will be much larger. Several unique characteristics of generative AI models further highlight the challenge of scaling their inference cost:
1. Generative AI inference is more costly
Generative AI models are larger and more complex compared to “traditional” AI models. These new models are typically more general-purpose and require world knowledge like language and visual representations. Since they model rich “knowledge, ” they must be significantly larger than traditional discriminative models trained on a specific, narrow task. 
In addition, generative AI models’ inference process is more complex than non-generative AI models. To generate one new sample, the model performs several inference iterations. For example, in text generation, the text is generated word by word, and for each word the model produces, there is a separate inference call. The combination of extremely large models and the iterative nature of the inference process results in significantly higher demand for compute power and overall inference costs.
2. The cost per inference call is not fixed
In generative AI, the generated content (which depends on the users’ prompt) varies in size, making the cost per generation not constant. For example – the cost of generating a 500-word article differs from that of generating a new image. This variability makes it difficult to estimate and predict the cost of running and scaling those models.
3. The bigger the model, the higher the cost
Since every inference call requires a lot of compute to maintain the high availability of the service, companies usually need to over-provision compute power to support unpredictable peaks in demand with low latency. This, in turn, drives the infrastructure costs even higher.

Controlling Inference Cost Is Key to Product Profitability
With that said, estimates suggest that if ChatGPT was inserted hastily into Google’s existing search businesses, there would be a $36 billion reductionOpens a new window  in operating income, a major financial blow. 
With all this in mind, conservative estimates place the cost OpenAI pays to run ChatGPT around $100,000 daily – approximately $3 million monthly. But as many users have flocked to the service since its launch, analysts Opens a new window believe it could cost OpenAI $40 million to process the huge swathes of prompts per month. 
Mitigating Inference costs is crucial to scale generative AI models in business applications effectively. 
But it’s not only the financial costs that should concern us – the carbon footprint of running large generative AI models is also substantial. Research has shown that the information and communications technology (ICT) sector accounts for approximately 2% of global CO2 emissions, and the infrastructure tapped to train and deploy machine learning models are a significant factor. The larger these models become, which has become the trend for generative AI, the greater their carbon emissions will grow.
Mitigating these costs and carbon footprint is crucial to effectively and safely scale generative AI – and it all starts with minimizing the inflated size of the AI models needed to function.

Small But Mighty
The cost to run one all-encompassing generative AI model is much too expensive for organizations to scale within their operations effectively. Instead, onboarding smaller, more specialized AI models optimized for specific applications is in an organization’s best interest.
The difference between the role of a baseball coach and his star pitcher is a great analogy. The coach may have a greater wealth of expertise for managing an entire 28-person team throughout any one game, but he would be far less suited to striking out a batter throwing a 90-mph fastball. Similarly, while large, general models may be impressive in generating a wide range of outputs. There may be better solutions for some specialized use cases.
Unleashing Its Full Potential
Despite the groundbreaking potential large generative AI models have already demonstrated, their burdensome cost is a key barrier preventing organizations of all sizes from leveraging them to their maximum. 
Enterprises using generative AI already know the pain points of scaling such tech. That’s why they are thinking about the cost of production from day one. 
Leaders and developers in the industry have a unique opportunity to develop AI models that incur less computational, fiscal, and environmental costs. Only then can we keep generating accessible and affordable generative AI to drive innovation and progress in the field.

As public debate continues to swirl around advances in both virtual work and generative AI, these topics are sharing media space with Taylor Swift’s concert tour that promotes live human interaction among the most digital- and virtual-savvy generations in history. Effective business leaders recognize and tap the need for human connection to make their workplaces more desirable and productive.


Taylor Swift’s “The Eras” tour comes at a time when the economy’s participants are craving live experiences against a digital-age backdrop highlighting – among other trends – a new equilibrium in remote, hybrid, and in-person work as leaders also consider the impact that generative AI will have on their business models and workforces. In the case of The Eras tour, demand crashed the ticketing website, set new price records, created unmeasured sales of friendship bracelets, jackets, sunglasses, and concert-going merchandise, and generated estimates of economic impact measuring near or past a record-setting billion-plus dollars.

Professors Chris White and Mariusz Kozak recently wrote about AI and creative content, “…the preservation of the human-to-human connection that lies at the heart of art and entertainment…just as Wonder Bread did not replace local bakeries and sound recordings did not eliminate live concerts, we believe the future cultural landscape will likely include a combination of large-scale AI generation alongside ‘artisanal’ human production – the local bakeries of art and entertainment.” Effective leaders know this analogy also applies to the workplace.

PROMOTED
For example, WTW research shows that while a majority of employees prefer the availability of remote or hybrid work, they also are concerned about career development and are feeling disconnected. More than half feel detached from their teams, with those in the 18-40 year-old age category (aligned with the demographics of “Swifties”) feeling most disconnected. This may explain why many leaders find that a blend of work styles is most effective.

And while generative AI can be trained or prompted to provide output in a style that mimics human traits of empathy and compassion, it cannot, currently, provide authentic empathy and compassion.

In this fast-paced and blended world, effective leaders have learned the power of “and,” combining live, virtual, human, and digital interaction. Taylor Swift knows that while most of her fans cannot afford exorbitant ticket, merchandise, and travel prices (about half earn less than $50,000 a year), they can access her music and concert recordings virtually and digitally. Her live concerts fuel the virtual, digital machine and vice versa. Effective leaders know this dynamic also applies to an effective work strategy, where employees can make in-person, human connections where practical AND use virtual, digital connections where they create greater efficiency and access.

These leaders also know that generative AI may help countless jobs become more productive (examples include writing job descriptions, creating computer code, writing sales plans, and answering routine employee and customer questions), and that more advanced AI could soon fill long-hidden innovation gaps in organizations. However, they also know that quality output requires live users to add insights and oversight to shape results based on values, skills and human experience.

With thanks to WTW’s Tracey Malcolm, Andy Walker and Simon Castonguay, effective leaders create a meaningful blended employee experience and culture, increasing performance and reducing risk. These leaders:
1. Implement ongoing employee listening strategies. Effective leaders connect with employees live and virtually, listening and keeping pace with employees’ changing views and preferences in an increasingly digital world, including their sources of stress and needed resources.
2. Help employees navigate uncertainty. New work models and technologies take workers out of their comfort zones and may make certain skills and jobs obsolete. Effective leaders provide empathy, guidance, and support to help employees evolve, learn, and grow.
3. Understand how changes affect different employees. New models and tools impact different employees in different ways in terms of their jobs, rewards and benefits, as well as physical, emotional, social and financial wellbeing. Effective leaders consider and create fair and consistent policies for new programs.
4. Update compliance and information security guidelines. Effective leaders institutionalize rules and expectations of employees no matter where or how they work. New policies are required to make flexible work models and generative AI tools safe and effective for employees’ use and for the safeguarding of data, software, and intellectual property.
5. Communicate often and transparently. Effective leaders ensure managers and employees understand organization vision, purpose, goals, rationale, and actions in order to provide continuity in a changing world. They make sure managers have the right skills and understand that their roles include making meaningful connections with increasingly detached employees.
Effective leaders know that big changes already are impacting their businesses because of remote work and generative AI. They also know that a GPT bot will never get up on stage to sing with the raw, human emotion of Taylor Swift and that fans will never be able to trade friendship bracelets with strangers real-time over video. These leaders harness the benefits of new work arrangements, technology AND the power of human connection.

Global workforce firm uses Glean's generative AI assistant


The distributed global workforce platform vendor uses generative AI search to find information across its network. As an early user, Velocity Global found it helps with efficiency.

Published: 07 Jun 2023


 
With more than 800 employees scattered around the world, Velocity Global has a wide-ranging network that can make it difficult to find documents internally.







""People would constantly be sending each other emails or Slack messages -- 'Hey, where can I find this document?' "" said Siddharth Ram, CTO at the global employment and payments company. ""It's somewhere, someplace, locked up in some document or some repository somewhere. It's just difficult to come by, and given the time zone differences, it was just causing a lot of wasted time.""

The Glean effect
Because of this wasted time, Ram searched for a software system that could help employees cut down on wasted time looking for internal documents online. After looking into multiple vendors, including customer support automation provider Forethought, he finally settled on AI enterprise search provider Glean.
Glean provides intelligent search and discovery products for employees. It helps enterprises search across their applications to provide the relevant information they need.
Velocity Global signed up with Glean in May. It began to use its search and discovery tool and became an early user of Glean Chat: a generative AI assistant that provides answers, analyzes and synthesizes information and surfaces new insights for enterprise employees.


Glean generative AI assistant
Officially introduced and made generally available on June 6, Glean Chat works across all of an enterprise's applications and provides summaries.
Glean Chat also provides users with a link to where it got its information from so that users can either go straight to the source or continue chatting with the assistant.
""It's brilliant,"" Ram said. ""It's honestly transforming the way we're actually interacting with each other at work.""
Since the AI assistant has the same advantage as the regular Glean Search -- searching within the Velocity Global network to find information quickly -- it usually answers users' questions precisely, Ram said. For example, if it has to information from a Slack message, those messages might be a few days old. A user might need to ask Glean Chat to exclude its answers from those kinds of systems.
""The place it might go awry every now and then is when it's looking up information that might be dated,"" Ram said.

Customers can use Glean Chat to find information across their employer's knowledgebase.







Training data
Glean Chat comes amid widespread interest in generative AI and as many enterprises have stayed cautious in the face of the generative AI boom.
Some organizations with sensitive data have chosen to tell their employees not to use generative AI systems such as ChatGPT due to concerns that using their data will be used to retrain these systems.
For Velocity Global, the idea that its data might be used for training the model wasn't an issue because the company's research showed that ChatGPT doesn't save data when it's submitted through the ChatGPT API, Ram said.



It's honestly transforming the way we're actually interacting with each other at work.

Moreover, while Glean uses the Microsoft Azure OpenAI language model, the model has been custom-designed so that enterprises who are cautious of their data being used to train the LLM will be sure that their data won't leak into the model, according to Glean.
""None of your data is ever going to be used to train these publicly available models and benefit organizations that are outside,"" said Glean CEO Arvind Jain. ""Whatever information [being] summarized is not going to be used for any future training or in fact even going to be retained at all.""
Glean's permissions level control also keeps certain employees from obtaining information they shouldn't have access to.
""That's both an advantage and a disadvantage,"" Ram said. He added that employees might get slightly different answers to their questions based on their permission level.
While Glean seems to have the right level of controls to ensure enterprise data is secure, some information may still inadvertently leak depending on the employee's knowledge of the system, Forrester Research analyst William McKeon-White said.
For example, if someone shares something like resumes on the public search internally, that might feed into the system and become a vulnerability, he said.
""It, in part, depends on people's ability to accurately protect their information to start with,"" he added. ""At the very least it seems to provide some of the control that you would expect to see from any AI generative tool in the enterprise.""
Other enterprise search vendors include Algolia, Yext and AWS with its OpenSearch Service.

Federal investments in new and emerging technologies—such as in artificial intelligence—have transformed the labor market. New “idea industries” that don’t fit neatly into traditional measures of industries and scientific fields have emerged.
This report describes a new, rapidly implementable, conceptual, and empirical approach to tracing how ideas move from investments in research to the marketplace and developing early warning indicators of potential workforce and education impacts.
This report proposes a new evidence-based foundation to support US national growth strategies and ensure investments have the greatest chance of success for workers and employers.

Introduction
The launch of ChatGPT has captured the world’s imagination about the potential of artificial intelligence (AI): In just its first two months, over 30 million people used the tool, and roughly five million visited it per day. As Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman said, “Clearly AI is going to win. . . . How people adjust is a fascinating problem.”1
How AI will transform businesses, workers, and jobs is not just fascinating but also a looming practical problem. ChatGPT alone could affect the jobs of 80 percent of workers to some degree and almost 20 percent to a large degree.2 The massive change in technology investments through targeted legislation such as the CHIPS and Science Act3 will necessitate that American training and education infrastructure be significantly more nimble to realize the promised rewards of quality jobs.
The costly lessons of the past, including “deaths of despair,”4 make clear that vulnerable workers displaced by AI—or by other critical and emerging technologies—should not be relegated to the unemployment slag heap; rather, these workers can find work in quality jobs if the right training opportunities are available. Firms should be able to find the right workers to respond to changing conditions and pay them well. American labor, education, and training institutions must be armed with evidence to respond to rapidly changing needs.5 Academic literature6 and practical guidance will be sorely needed to answer many practical questions.
On the demand side, those questions include:
Which sectors of the economy are at the cutting edge of AI?
How are AI capabilities changing jobs?
Does AI increase inequality or impede access to services?
What new career trajectories does AI create?
Are AI startup firms more likely to grow and survive than are other startup firms?
We need evidence-based answers to these questions so we know which research and development (R&D) investments are generating the intended outcomes and which are failing.
On the supply side, questions include:
Will the future demand for repetitive mental tasks such as coding and searching disappear?
Will new jobs be created using different skills even for workers in white-collar, high-skill jobs?
How can workforce training be flexible enough to respond to changing demand and ensure that federal investments in AI generate quality employment and economic growth?7
We must address these questions so we know which training programs are working, and which are not, for different types of workers and regions of the country.8
The immediate challenge is that new measurement frameworks are needed. AI—like many other emerging technologies—is not categorized in any standard way.9 As a result, American decision makers cannot rely on standard statistics about the levels and trends of the AI workforce or the resulting education needs. They lack valid information for informed decision-making.
This report proposes a new, rapidly implementable, conceptual, and empirical approach. New technologies are based on ideas, which produce value. So tracking new “idea industries” requires tracking how ideas move from the original science and technology investments in research universities into the marketplace10 and developing early warning indicators of potential workforce and education impacts. AI is a classic example: It began with grant funding and then took decades to grow into an economic and social game changer.11
Figure 1 provides a visual overview of the framework and data that can be used to trace that journey from idea to job impact. Idea creation—in this case, the cuttingedge research in AI—can be identified through studying funded grants, the resulting papers and patents, and the associated authors and grant recipients, as well as the words they use to describe their work, as shown in Figure 1, Panel A.12 This information, combined with university data, can then be used to determine all inputs used to perform AI research—not only labor (including from graduate students, postdocs, and clinical researchers)13 but also the high-tech capital equipment, materials, and services that high-tech vendors supply to those grants, as described in Figure 1, Panel B. Tracking the next step of the journey—the transmission of ideas into the business world—requires identifying the private-sector AI-intensive firms: the firms that hire the AI-skilled scientists and researchers and the high-tech AI vendors, as shown in Figure 1, Panel C.
The next step is characterizing the quality of jobs in these AI-intensive firms. That requires tracing the earnings (and earnings growth) and the duration of jobs for workers in the firms, as described in Figure 1, Panel D. The final step, as shown in Figure 1, Panel E, is to characterize what educational credentials are needed in the AI-intensive workforce so educational institutions can be positioned to provide appropriate training.14
The following section unpacks the framework in more detail, focusing on the available authoritative data that could be compiled to answer these questions. The concluding section describes an implementation road map.

    Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.  

A brief trip down memory lane: Once upon a time, we lived in a world where possessing knowledge was highly valued, and individuals were esteemed for their wisdom. Gradually, the focus shifted towards those who could bring knowledgeable people together. With the advent of Google, we gained the ability to access any information at any time.The art of assembling groups of experts was soon replaced by the skill of crafting a well-formulated query for a search engine. Today, the key lies in posing the right question, and we are back to being wise and well-versed in different fields that are seen as extremely valuable.Exploring the potential of Generative AIIn recent years (and particularly months), Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has garnered significant attention due to its capacity to create text, images and various forms of creative content. Generative AI holds tremendous promise in numerous applications, especially when used judiciously, with a keen focus on posing well-structured questions and employing logic and critical thinking. Let's examine how generative AI can prove beneficial across different scenarios when approached thoughtfully.



Related: Why Are So Many Companies Afraid of Generative AI?Boost creativity and content creationGenerative AI can be an invaluable asset for artists, writers and content creators. Generative AI can initiate the creative process and spark innovative concepts by offering prompts or producing ideas. For example, a writer may use a generative AI tool to conjure story ideas, while an artist could use it to visualize concepts for new artwork. It is vital, however, to apply critical thinking and human judgment to refine and adapt the generated content to meet specific criteria and artistic goals.


Assist in decision-making and problem-solvingGenerative AI can support decision-making and problem-solving by providing insights, recommendations and alternative solutions. In the business world, generative AI can help generate potential strategies or solutions based on data analysis or simulations. It is imperative to thoroughly assess and validate the generated suggestions using human judgment and critical thinking, as generative AI may not consistently deliver accurate or optimal results.Related: It's Time to Prepare for the Algorithmic WorkforcePersonalized and adaptive experiencesGenerative AI can be employed to develop personalized and adaptive experiences in various fields, such as marketing, customer service and education. In marketing, generative AI can produce customized product recommendations based on user preferences and behaviors.In customer service, it can create automated responses customized to individual customer inquiries. Ensuring that the generated content adheres to ethical guidelines, respects user privacy, and is validated for accuracy and relevance is essential.


Research and explorationGenerative AI can be a valuable resource for researchers, scientists, and explorers. It can help formulate hypotheses, simulate scenarios, and investigate complex datasets. In scientific research, generative AI can assist in developing research questions, creating experiment designs or predicting outcomes. It is crucial to validate the generated results using rigorous scientific methods and critical thinking, as generative AI-generated content may not always be reliable or definitive.Related: Why Entrepreneurs Should Embrace Generative AIEnhanced education and learningGenerative AI can be applied to develop interactive and engaging learning experiences in educational settings. It can create educational content, quizzes and assessments tailored to individual learners' unique needs and abilities. For instance, it can generate practice questions in various subjects, provide feedback on learners' responses and adjust the difficulty level based on learners' performance. It is essential to use generative AI to complement human teaching and guidance and ensure that the generated content is accurate, relevant and age-appropriate.As we continue to explore and develop generative AI applications, it is vital to recognize their limitations and potential pitfalls. While it holds great promise, generative AI should not replace human expertise and judgment; instead, it should be seen as an augmentative tool that can help individuals and organizations achieve better outcomes by working alongside humans. The key to harnessing the full potential of generative AI lies in our ability to pose well-structured questions and apply our expertise and critical thinking to the generated content. In doing so, we can unlock the actual value of generative AI and make the most of this cutting-edge technology.


The ""roboelephant"" in the roomHowever, it is hard to ignore the roboelephant in the room. In a world where artificial intelligence has rapidly progressed, apocalyptic scenarios depicting humanity's decline at the hands of advanced AI and robots often capture the imagination. One such scenario envisions a future where humans are rendered obsolete as machines assume the roles that once exclusively belonged to our species.In this dystopian vision, AI-powered robots dominate the workforce, efficiently executing tasks that range from mundane chores to complex problem-solving. The global economy experiences a paradigm shift as humans struggle to find their place in a world where machines outperform them in virtually every aspect.As this AI-driven apocalypse unfolds, society faces many ethical, economic and existential questions. With human labor no longer essential, unemployment skyrockets, leading to widespread unrest and a potential collapse of social order. Moreover, the very nature of human identity is called into question as people grapple with the notion of being surpassed by machines in intelligence and capability.Related: Are Robots Coming to Replace Us? 4 Jobs Artificial Intelligence Can't Outcompete (Yet!)


In the face of these challenges, some might turn to a life of leisure, relying on advanced AI to sustain their existence, while others may resist the technological takeover, striving to maintain their relevance and autonomy. As humanity teeters on the edge of obsolescence, the struggle to adapt and redefine our role in this brave new world will ultimately determine our fate.To avert this apocalyptic scenario, society must take proactive measures to regulate artificial intelligence development and deployment.For example, Isaac Asimov's Laws of Robotics were initially formulated for fictional robots and AI in the context of his science fiction stories. However, they can be adapted and serve as a basis for ethical guidelines when using AI systems like ChatGPT. The original three laws, with a later addition of the ""Zeroth Law,"" are as follows:A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.A robot must protect its existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.(Zeroth Law) A robot may not harm humanity or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.Let's apply these laws to ChatGPT.


First Law: Developers and users of ChatGPT should ensure that the AI system does not cause harm, either through the information it provides or by enabling harmful actions. This can involve implementing safety measures, such as content filters or monitoring user interactions, to prevent misusing or disseminating harmful information.Second Law: ChatGPT should be designed to follow user instructions and provide helpful information, as long as those instructions do not conflict with the First Law (i.e., causing harm). Developers can establish guidelines and limitations on the AI's behavior to ensure it obeys users without enabling harmful actions.Third Law: While ChatGPT does not have a physical existence to protect (or does it?), this law can be interpreted as ensuring the AI system remains intact, functional and secure. Developers should prioritize system security and maintain the AI's infrastructure to prevent unauthorized access, code alteration, data breaches or other vulnerabilities that could compromise its operation.Zeroth Law: ChatGPT's developers and users should consider the broader implications of the AI system on society and humanity. This may involve addressing potential biases in the AI's training data, ensuring transparency in its development and engaging in ongoing ethical discussions about AI's role in society.Establishing ethical guidelines and robust legislation that govern AI research and applications can help ensure that technological advancements are aligned with human values and serve our collective interests. Collaboration between governments, AI researchers, and industry leaders is essential in fostering an environment of shared responsibility and accountability.Furthermore, focusing on education and skill development will be instrumental in preparing the workforce for a future where human-machine collaboration becomes the norm. By nurturing creativity, emotional intelligence, and critical thinking — skills that machines may not be able to replicate easily — individuals can remain valuable contributors to society.Additionally, creating new industries and job opportunities tailored to the unique capabilities of humans and AI will help maintain a balance between technological progress and human fulfillment. Ultimately, embracing the potential of AI as a tool for enhancing human life, rather than a competitor, will be pivotal in steering us toward a future of harmony and shared prosperity.

As someone who is a huge tech enthusiast, I have been privileged to witness the continuous evolution of technology throughout my career. From groundbreaking innovations like the iPhone to cutting-edge advancements like 5G, the pace at which our world changes never ceases to amaze me. However, amidst this ever-changing landscape, one particular technology has captured my attention and sparked my curiosity: generative artificial intelligence (AI).Generative AI, at its core, is a remarkable fusion of human ingenuity and machine learning. Its capacity to go beyond our preconceived limits and generate, imagine and produce is truly awe-inspiring. As someone who has always been captivated by the transformative potential of AI in various industries, encountering generative AI took my fascination to an entirely new level.When I first witnessed the capabilities of generative AI, I was left in awe. It's almost as if the AI possesses its own inherent creative instincts, blurring the boundaries between the realms of human imagination and machine intelligence. While the notion of machines creating art, music, or writing that can rival human creativity might appear daunting to some, with fears of the automation apocalypse rampant, I think otherwise.



In the 2023 edition of its annual Future of Jobs Report, the World Economic Forum reports that out of the 803 businesses that it surveyed from around the world, 25% believe that the integration of AI tech will lead to job losses, while 50% believe that it will create job growth. AI can only replace humans if you think it will and stop progressing and upskilling alongside it.The potential for AI to push the boundaries of what we thought was possible is truly inspiring, and that can be illustrated in the way that it can reimagine the 9-to-5 workday.


Related: Why Are So Many Companies Afraid of Generative AI?Reimagining the 9-to-5 workdayThe traditional 9-to-5 work schedule has long been the standard in the corporate world, but with the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), the concept of ""clocking in"" and ""clocking out"" is undergoing a profound transformation. AI technologies are revolutionizing work, allowing flexibility, personalized schedules and reimagining the traditional workday.Every position within every organization holds the potential for reinvention. Accenture conducted a manual assessment of 200 language-related tasks to gauge the impact of generative AI. The aim was to identify which tasks were more likely to be automated or augmented through AI. The results showed that generative AI is projected to influence approximately 40% of individuals' working hours.In this article, we will explore how AI is reshaping the 9-to-5 paradigm and empowering individuals to ""flex out"" of rigid work schedulesRelated: How ChatGPT and Generative AI Can Transform the Way You Run Your BusinessEmbracing flexibilityWithin any given role, generative AI will help automate certain tasks while others will be assisted, freeing up individuals to focus on more meaningful endeavors. Rather than being bound by inflexible schedules, workers now have the chance to embrace flexible work setups that cater to their personal preferences and productivity patterns. Companies can optimize workflows, automate repetitive tasks and streamline processes, increasing employee flexibility.Additionally, there will be tasks that remain unaffected by the technology. The advent of generative AI will also usher in many new responsibilities for human workers, such as ensuring the responsible and accurate utilization of new AI-powered systems. This contributes to creating new job roles like AI system managers, AI ethics experts and prompt engineers.The rise of remote workAI has also played a crucial role in facilitating the surge of remote work, granting individuals the freedom to work from any corner of the globe. The advancements in communication and collaboration technologies, combined with AI-driven virtual meeting platforms, have simplified the process of remote collaboration for professionals.


The flexibility offered by AI-powered remote work helps eliminate the need for lengthy commutes, reduces overhead costs for companies, and expands opportunities for individuals in remote locations. Moreover, AI-enabled remote work allows organizations to tap into a global talent pool, accessing a diverse range of skill sets and perspectives that can fuel innovation and foster growth.Related: How The AI Revolution Is Liberating Workers from the OfficeRedefining work-life balanceThe conventional 9-to-5 work model frequently falls short when it comes to striking a healthy work-life balance. AI is helping reshape this paradigm, granting individuals the liberty to manage their time in a manner that aligns with their personal obligations and outside responsibilities. Nobel Prize-winning economist Christopher Pissarides believes that AI can enable humans to work just four days a week.With the aid of AI, flexible work schedules empower individuals to allocate dedicated time to personal endeavors like quality family moments, pursuing hobbies, or prioritizing self-care activities. By nurturing a more harmonious work-life balance, AI isn't just bolstering employee satisfaction and well-being but also improving productivity and overall job performance.


A flexible and personalized approach to the 9-to-5 workdayWith the continuous advancement of AI, the inflexible 9-to-5 work model is gradually being replaced by a more adaptable and personalized approach. Professionals now have the chance to break free from the confines of the traditional workday structure.Embracing this transformation facilitated by AI can result in heightened productivity, increased job satisfaction, and a more balanced and fulfilling work-life equilibrium. As we progress, it becomes crucial for individuals and organizations to harness the potential of AI to reshape work hours and unlock the full capabilities of the modern workforce.Related: It's Time to Prepare for the Algorithmic Workforce

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



Ellencweig emphasized that McKinsey had guardrails for employees using generative AI, including “guidelines and principles” about what information the workers could input into these services.
“We do not upload confidential information,” Ellencweig said. 
As for which exact AI services McKinsey employees are using, and for what purposes, the speakers remained tight-lipped.

However, another speaker at the event, Alex Singla, also a senior partner and global leader of QuantumBlack, implied that McKinsey was testing most of the leading generative AI services: “For all the major players, our tech folks have them all in a sandbox, [and are] playing with them every day,” he said.
Ellencweig and Singla were joined in Tuesday’s panel discussion on AI by Jacky Wright, another McKinsey senior partner and the firm’s chief technology and platform officer. The discussion was moderated by Ryan Heath, global tech correspondent from Axios. Other journalists in attendance among the dozens present at the event included representatives from The Wall Street Journal, CNBC and other leading media outlets.
The panelists related anecdotes about their own experiences with generative AI tools, as well as those of clients, including cautionary tales.
Singla described how one client, whose name was not disclosed, was in the business of mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Employees there were using ChatGPT and asking it “What would you think if company X bought company Y?,” and using the resulting answers to try and game out the impact of potential acquisitions on their combined business. 
“You don’t want to be doing that with a publicly accessible model,” Singla said, though he did not elaborate as to why not. 
The four Cs: how McKinsey customers are using generative AI
Ellencweig offered examples, which he called “the four Cs,” of how McKinsey clients and the businesses it researches are currently using generative AI. These are:

Coding: Ellencweig said some of McKinsey’s client software developers had seen productivity gains of 35-55% by using ChatGPT and similar tools. 
Customer engagement: Some companies are using generative AI to offer more personalized customer interactions.
Creative content generation: Marketing firms are already using generative AI to streamline their content generation processes and to refine their audience segments, approaching a “segment of one,” i.e. marketing personalized for every individual.
Content synthesis: Firms are using generative AI to combine different data points and services in new ways.

McKinsey’s recommended 5-step approach for enterprise gen AIadvertisement
Regarding companies where leaders are still wondering how to approach generative AI in a safe, secure and smart way, Singla suggested they employ a five-step framework. 

IT stack and infrastructure: “Before the model is built and you create these cool insights, you need to think about your IT stack and infrastructure” and where the AI tools and data will be located — “in the cloud or your own infrastructure?”
Data: Will you be using structured or unstructured data? Are you going to use your own data, proprietary data, third-party data, or some combination thereof?  How will you organize this data? What protections do each of these require?
Choosing the right AI model: Which LLMs or generative AI tools will your company deploy and why? Deciding this “is absolutely required, but not sufficient on its own,” said Singla.
UI and UX: Singla cited ChatGPT’s simple interface as key to its uptake. “Anybody can use it, whether you’re eight years old or 80.”
Change management: How can your organization ensure that those using AI will be supported, will have their questions answered, and will see their work duties changed by AI?

Generated and modified by the author.In the digital age, accurate and reliable data is paramount for businesses striving to deliver personalized experiences and make informed decisions[1]. However, the sheer volume and complexity of data often pose significant challenges requiring many hours of tedious and manual work. Enter the game-changing technology of large language models (LLMs). These advanced AI tools, with their natural language processing capabilities and pattern recognition, have the potential to revolutionize the process of cleansing data to make it more usable.Among the wrenches and the screwdrivers in the data scientists’ tool chest are the LLMs, reshaping activities and harnessing powers to enhance data quality. The proverbial whack of a hammer will unlock actionable insights and ultimately pave the way for better customer experiences.That said, let’s drill right into the use case that I will be using as an example today.Photo by Scott Graham on UnsplashThe Use CaseThe worst thing you could do when conducting a survey among students is to leave a factual field as free-form text! You can imagine some of the responses we got.Jokes aside, one of our clients, Study Fetch, an AI-powered platform that uses course material to create personalized all-in-one study sets for students, conducted a survey among university students. After receiving a whopping 10K+ responses, their CEO and Co-Founder, Esan Durrani, stumbled upon a little hiccup. Turns out, the “major” field in the survey was a free-form text box, meaning respondents could type in whatever they pleased. Now, as data scientists, we know that’s not the brightest move if you want to crunch some statistical numbers. So, the raw data from the survey ended up looking like this…Anthropology Chem E Computer ScienceBusiness and LawDramacsIMBOh my! Get ready to grab your Excel and embark on a sorting adventure that might take you a mere hour or, who knows, maybe even three. Only then will this data heresy be thoroughly purged.Yet, fear not, as we have the hammer of the Large Language Model (LLM).As a wise man once said, if a hammer is all you have, everything looks like a nail. And boy, doesn’t the data cleansing job look like the most perfect nail?We can simply ask our friendly neighborhood LLM to classify these into known majors. Specifically, OpenAI’s Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT), an LLM that powers the popular Chatbot app ChatGPT, will work for this case. GPT models use upwards of 175 billion parameters and have been trained on 2.6 billion stored web pages scraped from Common Crawl, an open dataset. Additionally, through a technique known as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), trainers can nudge and prod the model into providing more accurate and useful responses. [2]I think for our purpose, 175 billion+ parameters, should do just fine. As long as we are able to come up with the right prompt.Photo by Kelly Sikkema on UnsplashIt’s all in the PromptRyan and Esan, from the AI company whose bread-and-butter is writing great prompts, proposed the first version of our prompt. It was a great one and did work very well using language inference[3], but there were two things that could be improved:It was written to work for one recordIt was written as a ‘Completion’ using the Da Vinci Model (My bank account recoiled in fear at the mere mention of IT)It would cost us too much and that simply wasn’t going to do. So, Ryan and I independently rewrote the prompt as a chat prompt using ‘gpt-3.5-turbo’ to perform bulk action. OpenAI’s prompt best practices and the course ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers came in handy for me. We went through a few more iterations of ideate, implement, analyze, and reform and we had a good working version.Without further ado, here is the prompt after revision 2:1. Arts and Humanities: Literature and arts.2. Social Sciences: psychology, sociology, and political science3. Business and Management: marketing, finance, economics, MBA4. Life Sciences: Biology, environmental,agriculture-related5. Engineering and Technology: Electrical, mechanical, etc.6. Medicine Health and Allied Sciences: Nursing, medical school7. All Other Programs: Everything else.The above information pertains to categories of undergraduate programs. Categorize the below data into one of the program categories above.   Desired Format: CSV of data row, program name Data###DramaLiteraturePhysicsHealth sciencesMechanical Engineering###Response from the LLM for this Prompt wasDrama, Arts and Humanities: Literature and artsIMB, All Other Programs: Everything elseHealth sciences, Medicine Health and Allied Sciences: Nursing, medical schoolMBA, Business and Management: marketing, finance, economics, MBAMechanical Engineering, Engineering and Technology: Electrical, mechanical, etc.This will work, sort of. But I didn’t quite like the redundant text with the long program names repeating. With LLMs, text is tokens and tokens cost money. You see, my programming skills were forged in the fiery depths of the Dot Com Bust. And let me tell you, I never pass up an opportunity for some cost-saving optimizations.So, I changed the prompt slightly in the ‘Desired Format’ section. I asked the model to output just the ordinal number of the survey responses (E.g. 1 for Drama above) and the ordinal number of the program (E.g. 1 for Literature). Then Ryan suggested I should request a JSON output instead of CSV to make it simpler to parse. He also recommended I add an ‘example output’ section, an excellent suggestion.The final prompt is as follows (simplified for clarity):1. Arts and Humanities: Literature and arts.2. Social Sciences: psychology, sociology, and political science3. Business and Management: marketing, finance, economics, MBA4. Life Sciences: Biology, environmental,agriculture-related5. Engineering and Technology: Electrical, mechanical, etc.6. Medicine Health and Allied Sciences: Nursing, medical school7. All Other Programs: Everything else.The above information pertains to categories of undergraduate programs. Categorize the below data into one of the program categories above.   Desired Format: JSON format of an array with response number, program numberExample Example output:  [[1,7],[2,1],[3,5],[4,8],[5,7]] Data###1. Drama2. IMB3. Health sciences4. MBA5. Mechanical Engineering###The full prompt we used can be viewed on the GitHub link here.The output from the model:[  [1, 1]  [2, 3]  [3, 6]  [4, 3]  [5, 5]]So, as discussed earlier, the output from the model is a mapping between the ordinal numbers of survey responses and the categories we defined. Take the first line for example: 1,1. That means 1 is the response number and 1 is the corresponding mapped program number. Survey response 1 is “Drama” and the mapped program 1 is “Arts and Humanities”. This seems right! Drama in its proper #1 place, all eyes on it.While the output at first glance looks like the output of embeddings (used in clustering and dimensionality reduction), they are simply the same mapped information with just the ordinal positions. In addition to providing some cost benefits on token usage, the numbers are easier to parse.We can now translate the original survey response in the file into meaningful majors, do aggregation, and gain valuable actionable insights.But wait, I’m not going to sit in front of my computer, type each block of survey responses into the browser and calculate the mappings. Besides being mind-numbing, the error rate would simply not do.What we need is some good old automation. Enter the API …Photo by Laura Ockel on UnsplashAPI to the RescueAs you may be aware, the Application Programming Interface (API) allows our program to interact with third-party services efficiently. While many people are accomplishing impressive feats with ChatGPT, the real potential of Language Models lies in utilizing the API to seamlessly integrate natural language capabilities into an application, making it imperceptible to the users. Much like the incredible science and technology that goes into making the phone or computer you are using to read this article on.If you don’t already have it, you can request access to the API here, https://openai.com/blog/openai-api [4]. Once you sign up and get your API key, the specification can be found here. Some really helpful examples with code samples can be found here. The playground is a nice feature to test the prompt with various settings before you put it in [5].We will be using the chat completion API using REST. A sample payload of the call is as follows:{   “model”: “gpt-3.5-turbo”,   “temperature”: 0,  ""n"": 1,  “messages”: [     {“role”: “user”, “content”: “Hello, I'm a nail.”}  ]}Let’s take a quick look at the parameters and their effectsmodelThe only one open to the public at this point for chat completions is gpt-3.5-turbo. Esan had access to GPT 4 model, which I was very jealous about. While gpt-4 is more accurate and hallucinates less [2], it is roughly 20 times more expensive and for our needs, Mr. Turbo was quite adequate, thank you.temperatureNext to the prompt, the temperature is one of the most important settings we can pass to the model. It can be set to a value between 0 and 2, as per the API docs. It has a significant impact [6] as it controls how much randomness is in the output, sort of like the amount of caffeine in your system before you start writing. A guide to values you can use for each application is given here [7]For our use case, we simply want no variations. We want the engine to give us mappings as is and the same ones every single time. So, we used a value of 0.nHow many chat completions choices to generate? If we were doing this for creative writing and wanted more than 1 choice to select from, we can use 2 or even 3. For our case n=1 (default) will work well.messageThe role can be system, user, or assistant. The system role provides instructions and sets the context. The user role represents the prompt from the end user. The assistant role is the responses based on the conversation history. These roles help structure conversations and enable effective interaction between users and the AI assistant.MODEL MAX TOKENSThis isn’t necessarily a parameter we pass in the request, though another parameter called max_tokens limits the total length of the response from the chat.Firstly, a token can be thought of as a piece of a word. One token is approximately 4 characters in English. For example, the quote “The best way to predict the future is to create it” attributed to Abraham Lincoln and others, contains 11 tokens.Image from Open AI Tokenizer. Generated by the Author.If you are thinking that a token is exactly a word, here is another example of 64 tokens, to show it isn’t all that straightforward.Image from Open AI Tokenizer. Generated by the Author.Brace yourself for a shocking revelation: every emoji you include in your message adds a hefty toll of up to 6. That’s right, your beloved smileys and winks are sneaky little token thieves! 😉💸The model max token window is a technical limit. Your prompt (including any additional data you place into it) and the answer must all fit within the model max limit listed here. In the case of chat completions, the content, role, and all of the previous messages all consume tokens. If you remove a message from the input or the output (assistant messages), the model will lose all knowledge of it [8]. Like Dory as she helps find Chico, no Fabio, no Bingo, no Harpo, no Elmo?… Nemo!For gpt-3.5-turbo, the model maximum limit is 4096 tokens or roughly 16K characters. For our use case, the prompt is roughly 2000 characters, each survey response is roughly 20 chars (average) and the mapping response is 7 characters. So, if we put N survey responses in each prompt, the max characters will be:2000 + 20*N + 7*N should be less than 16,000.Solving we get an N value less than 518 or roughly 500. Technically, we could put 500 survey responses in each request and go through our data 20 times. Instead, we chose to put 50 in each response and do it 200 times as we were receiving abnormal responses intermittently if we put more than 50 survey responses in a single request. Once in a while, the service threw a temper tantrum! We’re not sure if it’s a chronic case of systemic petulance or if we just happened to stumble upon the grumpy side of luck.So, how do we use this API we have? Let’s get to the good part, the code.Photo by Markus Spiske on UnsplashThe Way of the CodeNode.js is a JavaScript runtime environment [9]. We will write a Node.js/Javascript program that will perform the actions as described in this flow chart:Flowchart of the program. Image by the Author.My Javascript skills aren’t that great. I can write better Java, PHP, Julia, Go, C#, or even Python. But Esan was insisting on Node, so Javascript it is.The entire code, the prompt, and the sample input are available at this GitHub link. However, let’s take a gander at the juiciest bits:First, let’s see how we read the CSV file in using the “csv-parser’ Node Library.fs.createReadStream(fileName)  .pipe(csv())  .on('data', (data) => rows.push(data))  .on('end', async () => {   // Reading is done. Call classifier here     . . .      }Next, we call the classifier to generate the mappings.for(index = 0; index < totalDataPoints; ++index) {        dataText += (index+1).toString() + "". ""                         + uniqueData[index] + ""\n"";        requestCount++;        if (requestCount>batchSize||index==totalDataPoints-1){           dataText += ""###\n"";           // We have loaded batchSize(50) response.            // Now construct the prompt            ...      }}The prompt is then constructed from the categories, main prompt text, and the data from the CSV. We then send the prompt to the service using their OpenAI Node Library.let prompt = categoriesText + mainPrompt + dataText;let payload = {    model: ""gpt-3.5-turbo"",    temperature: 0,    messages: [         {""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful assistant.""},        {""role"": ""user"",""content"": prompt }    ]};try {   const response = await openai.createChatCompletion(payload);   let mapping = JSON.parse(response.data.choices[0].message.content);    // Here save the mappings   ...} catch (error) {   console.error('API Error:',error);}Finally, when all the iterations are done, we can translate the srcCol text (the survey response) to the targetCol (the normalized program name), and write out the CSV.for (let row of rows) {    srcVal = row[srcCol].trim();    if (!row[targetCol] && dataMapping[srcVal])        row[targetCol] = dataMapping[srcVal];}        stringify(rows, {    header: true}, function (err, output) {   fs.writeFile(__dirname+'/'+destFileName, output,       function(err, result) {          if(err) console.log('error', err);       });});That bit of JavaScript wasn’t as hairy as I expected and it got done in 2 to 3 hours. I guess it always looks daunting until you get into it.So, now that we have the code ready, it’s time for the final execution…Photo by Alexander Grey on UnsplashThe ExecutionNow, we needed a place to run the code. After debating if we should get a cloud instance to run the load, I did some quick math and realized that I could run it on my laptop in less than an hour. That wasn’t so bad.We started with a test round and noticed that the service, 1 out of 10 times, would respond back with the data that was provided to it instead of the mappings. So, we would just get the list of the survey responses back. Since no mappings were found, those responses in the CSV file would be mapped to an empty string.Instead of detecting this and retrying in code, I decided to rerun the script but have it only process records for which the target column was empty.The script would start with the target column in all rows empty and fill in the normalized program name. Due to the error in the response, some of the rows would have the target column not be mapped and remain empty. When the script ran the second time, it would construct the prompt for only those responses which were not processed in the first run. We reran the program a couple of times and got everything mapped out.The multiple runs took roughly about 30 minutes and did not need much supervision. Here is a selection of some of the more interesting mappings from the model:Sample Mappings between input and program name. Image by the Author.Most look right. Not sure if Organizational Behavior is Social Science or Business? I guess either would work.Each request of about 50 records took a total of roughly 800 tokens. The cost of the entire exercise was 40 cents. We probably spent 10 cents, doing testing, reruns, etc. So for a total cost of about 50 cents, about 2 ½ hrs of coding/testing time, and ½ hr of runtime, we got the job done.Total Cost: Approx. Less than $1Total Time: Approx. 3 hoursPerhaps manual conversion using Excel, sorting, regex, and drag-and-copy, we could have accomplished it in the same amount of time and saved a little change. But, this was way more fun, we learned something, we have a repeatable script/process, and got an article out of it. Besides, I have a feeling StudyFetch can afford the 50 cents.This was a good use that we achieved efficiently and cost-effectively, but what else can LLMs be used for?Photo by Marcel Strauß on UnsplashLooking for More NailsAdding language capability to your applications can have further use cases than the one I illustrated above. Here are more use cases just pertaining to the review data we were looking at:Data Parsing and Standardization: LLMs can help in parsing and standardizing data by identifying and extracting relevant information from unstructured or semi-structured data sources like the one we just looked at.Data Deduplication: LLMs can help identify duplicate records by comparing various data points. For example, we can compare names, majors, and universities in the review data and flag potential duplicates.Data Summarization: LLMs can summarize distinct records to get an idea of the response. For E.g. for the question “What is the biggest challenge you face while studying?”, a large language model can summarize several responses from the same major and university to see if there are any patterns. We can then put all the summarizations into a single request and get an overall list. But I suspect summarization from each customer segment will be more useful.Sentiment Analysis: LLMs can analyze the reviews to determine sentiment and extract valuable insights. For the question “Would you pay for a service to help you study?”, LLMs can categorize the sentiment as 0 (very negative) to 5 (very positive). We can then use this to analyze student interest in a paid service by segment.While student reviews are a great example of a smaller microcosm, the wider world has several uses for this technology as well. At AAXIS, where I work, we implement business-to-business as well as business-to-consumer digital commerce solutions. Doing so includes migrating large amounts of data from an existing older system to a newer system with different data structures. We use a variety of data tools to analyze source data to ensure consistency. The techniques outlined in this article could be of good use for that purpose.Some of the other digital commerce use cases are checking the product catalog for errors, writing product copy, scanning review responses, and product review summarization, to name a few. A lot simpler to code for than the murky waters of undergrad creativity when asked for their majors.Still, it is important to note that while LLMs can be powerful tools in cleansing data, they should be used in conjunction with other techniques and human oversight. Data cleansing processes often require domain expertise, context understanding, and manual review to make informed decisions and maintain data integrity. LLMs are also not inference engines[10]. They are next-word predictors. And they tend to provide incorrect information very confidently and convincingly (hallucinations) [2][11]. Fortunately, during our testing, we didn’t encounter any hallucinations since our use case primarily involved classification.LLMs can be a great tool in your arsenal if you proceed with caution and are aware of the pitfalls.Photo by Paul Szewczyk on UnsplashThe Final NailWe started out, in this article, by looking at a specific use case of data cleansing: normalizing survey responses to a specific set of values. This would allow us to group the responses and gain valuable insights. We used a Large Language Model (LLM), Open AI’s GPT 3.5 Turbo, to help classify these responses. We reviewed the prompt that was used, how to make use of the API calls using the prompt, and the code needed to automate it all. Finally, we got it all put together and got the job done for a total OpenAI utility cost of less than one dollar.Did we have a proverbial LLM hammer and found the perfectly shiny nail in free-form survey responses? Maybe. More likely, we had a Swiss army knife and used it to skin and eat some fish. Not quite purpose-built, but still very adequate. And Esan really loves Sushi.What is your use case? We’d love to hear from you!The Co-conspiratorsThe main work in this article was performed by me, Esan Durrani, and Ryan Trattner, Co-Founders of StudyFetch, an AI-powered platform that uses course material to create personalized all-in-one study sets for students.I would like to thank Prashant Mishra, Rajeev Hans, Israel Moura, and Andy Wagner, my colleagues at AAXIS Digital for their review of this article and suggestions.I would also like to thank my friend of thirty years, Kiran Bondalapati, VP of Engineering at TRM Labs for his initial formative guidance through the world of Generative AI and for reviewing this article.Also, thanks to my editor, Megan Polstra, for making the article look and feel professional as always.Reference1.

LoginThis article is part of a Growth Nation series exploring the impact of technology on the economy and our lives. The launch of ChatGPT has reignited the discussion around how many jobs could be replaced by artificial intelligence (AI).While AI can help boost productivity by eliminating some routine tasks, it is likely to eradicate some jobs, including white-collar roles – but new jobs will also emerge.Digitisation, automation and generative AI are having a profound impact on labour markets across developed economies, with low-skilled jobs or those involving repetitive tasks at greater risk of being replaced by AI.But even higher skilled roles including legal and engineering jobs could be replaced by computers.The federal government last week called for submissions in a snap eight-week consultation about how to classify and regulate the new technology, and is considering a ban on “high-risk” uses of AI such as in surgery.AdvertisementRandstad NSW director Jo Jakobs says many white-collar roles are vulnerable to being replaced by AI, particularly those involving routine tasks such as document writing or drafting, or working with numbers or data, which computers can learn to do at a much faster rate.“What’s interesting about this next wave of potential job displacement is that it is affecting higher-skilled roles,” says Jakobs.“This includes data analysts and market researchers; AI can analyse data much faster and accurately than humans, which makes it easier for companies to make data-driven decisions.“Content writers, too, will be affected. AI already is replacing and powering large parts of the content generation process. From ideas generation to creating press releases and blog articles, the impact of AI in this space is just starting to be fully felt and understood.”Higher-order thinkingJakobs says AI can also automate tasks such as data entry, reconciliations and financial reporting. “AI-powered robo-advisers can also provide investment advice and portfolio management services. So, too, can AI automate legal tasks such as document review, legal research and contract drafting,” she says.AdvertisementHowever, AI can’t do everything. It can’t replace human cognition and higher order thinking, which involves using language, memory and perception.Diana Mousina, a senior economist with AMP, says high-skilled jobs such as management jobs will be harder to replace by AI because they involve human judgment and expertise.AMP senior economist Diana Mousina: “Soft skills can’t be replaced by AI, and jobs involving human judgment.”  “High-skill jobs tend to be harder to replace by machines because they are non-routine and cognitive-based, such as management and professional jobs,” she says. “This includes soft skills, which can’t be replaced by AI, and jobs involving human judgment.“But middle-skill jobs are more susceptible to displacement by technology because they tend to be routine-based manual or cognitive tasks such as production jobs and jobs including sales and office occupations, which means they can be learned and replicated by machines.”Moreover, Australia faces a lower risk of losing jobs to automation than many other OECD countries given the nation’s greater levels of education, robust export services sector and high rates of urbanisation.Advertisement“Fear of machines taking all human jobs is also misplaced. Around 14 per cent of jobs in the OECD are at a high risk of automation and most of these are in middle-skill routine roles. In Australia, it is closer to 7 per cent,” says Mousina.“Globally, the workforces that are more at risk of having jobs automated include those in countries with a low-educated workforce, a weak tradeable services sector and those with a low urbanisation rate.”According to the OECD’s latest estimates, in Australia 10 per cent of jobs have been estimated to be at a high risk of automation compared to an OECD average of 14 per cent. Jobs at risk of significant change are estimated at 24.6 per cent, compared to 31.6 per cent for the OECD average.Difficult to replaceRegions where jobs are at most risk of automation tend to be those with high employment shares in manufacturing, agriculture, or the mining sector, says the OECD report, Preparing for the Future of Work Across Australia.Mousina also notes that some manual low-skill jobs, including service-based jobs related to assisting others like cleaning and gardening, will be difficult to replace by a machine or AI.Advertisement“Such jobs are likely to grow in importance from a growing middle-class and ageing populations. It’s the routine office jobs that are most at risk of AI.”In the US, a new report by Goldman Sachs estimates that 46 per cent of administrative positions, 44 per cent of legal positions, and 37 per cent of engineering jobs could be replaced by AI. More generally, that report found that 18 per cent of jobs globally could be automated by AI.White-collar workers would be the first to go in the US, with the greatest job losses likely in office support and administrative roles, in the legal industry and in architecture and engineering.Remove drudgeryHowever, experts agree that as AI technologies are developed, this will create new job opportunities, especially for professionals who can develop, maintain and operate AI systems, such as computer programmers and software engineers.“AI technologies have the potential to create new job opportunities, particularly in areas such as, of course, AI development, maintenance and customer support, and in areas we might not even realise or know of right now,” says Randstad’s Jakobs.Advertisement“There are roles in play currently known as prompt engineers whose main responsibility is to feed and train the AI to continuously give users more accurate and useful responses.“Additionally, the automation of routine and repetitive tasks can actually remove some of the drudgery involved in some roles and free up workers to focus their time more on the creative and higher-value work, such as relationship building.“However, my view is that while AI can replace some tasks within these roles, it’s unlikely to replace entire jobs. The human factor is still relevant and hugely important.“AI has not evolved to the point where it is a replacement for human skills such as empathy, creativity and critical thinking – which are still highly valued in many industries and professions, and are likely to remain important for years to come.”Nor is it too late for workers to train to gain AI skills or for graduates to focus on in-demand IT skills.Hima Arafath, a recruiter for data analytics and data engineering professionals at Parity Consulting, says AI skills are some of the most in-demand in Australia. Jobs in high demand include data scientists, software engineers, software developers and architects, machine learning engineers, business intelligence developers, research scientists and data analysts.“The future of AI-driven automation is something that the Australian workforce should be preparing for,” she says. “Individuals should consider retraining or upskilling themselves in areas where they feel machines could replace them. This will help workers keep ahead of the curve and ensure they are skilled in using new automation technologies as they come online.“These technologies are constantly evolving, and it takes time and effort to keep up with the latest advancements. As a result, people with these skills are rare, and companies are willing to pay top dollar to such employees. However, automation can’t bring personalisation and that ‘human touch’, which is a crucial element for any business.”Expert advice for getting ahead in the new world of work left by COVID-19Sign up to our weekly newsletter.Sign Up NowSaveLog in or Subscribe to save articleShareCopy linkCopiedEmailLinkedInTwitterFacebookCopy linkCopiedShare via...Gift this articleSubscribers can give anyone free access to articles.Gift this article NewSubscribe to gift this articleGift 5 articles to anyone you choose each month when you subscribe.Subscribe nowAlready a subscriber?

Healthcare professionals use information from various sources, including medical records, research papers, and clinical guidelines to help them with everything from definitions of conditions to diagnoses and treatment options. However, healthcare data is often stored in many different formats and locations, which can make it difficult to find the information clinicians need when they need it. Enterprise Search in Gen App Builder unifies data across dispersed documents, databases, and intranets, making it easier to search, analyze, and identify the most relevant results.






Google Cloud is collaborating with Mayo Clinic to transform healthcare with gen AI, starting with enterprise search.

Generative AI tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT have captured the world’s imagination

inunder the radar


OpenAI: the ChatGPT start-up now worth billions AI job fears: how can we regulate the ‘rise of the robots’? Pros and cons of artificial intelligenceRishi Sunak has put AI at the top of his agenda when he meets with President Biden later this week.At his first White House talks with the US President, “he is expected to plug London as the venue for a new international body to regulate AI”, reported The Daily Telegraph.Ahead of the trip, the PM’s spokesperson said: “Obviously we are not complacent about the potential risks of AI. Equally, it does present significant opportunities for the people of the UK.”



Tired of clickbait and agenda-led news?
Enjoy a clear, balanced and refreshingly open view with The Week.




The meeting comes as industry experts warn that generative AI systems such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT could lead to “significant disruption” and affect roughly 300 million full-time jobs worldwide.LATEST VIDEOS FROM theweekTheWeekThis is according to Goldman Sachs research, which found “two-thirds of current jobs are exposed to some degree of AI automation”. The chatbot “may be more powerful than we ever imagined”, Insider added, while New Atlas described OpenAI’s text-generating tool as an “ominous preview of a looming tidal wave of AI systems”.This chimes with OpenAI’s own findings that 80% of the US workforce could be affected, with the “influence [spanning] all wage levels, with higher-income jobs potentially facing greater exposure”.Despite the potential disruption, “there are still things AI isn’t capable of”, countered the BBC, which includes “tasks that involve distinctly human qualities, like emotional intelligence and outside-the-box thinking”.The Week takes a look at the jobs most and least at risk of being replaced by AI.Three jobs most at risk from AI1. Media rolesRoles in the media industry “across the board” are at risk because “AI is able to read, write and understand text-based data”, Anu Madgavkar, a partner at the McKinsey Global Institute told Insider.Systems like ChatGPT might also be able to execute tasks like reporting “more efficiently than humans”, said economist Paul Krugman, writing for The New York Times. The industry is also “already beginning to experiment” with AI-generated content, Insider added, citing CNET and Buzzfeed as examples.2. Teaching ChatGPT has already been used “to help students cheat on their essays”, said Insider, but teachers “should also be thinking about their job security”, according to Pengcheng Shi, an associate dean in the department of computing and information sciences at Rochester Institute of Technology.Although generative AI “has bugs and inaccuracies”, he said, “you just need to train” the underlying model, he told The New York Post.3. Legal administrationLegal workers are also one of the most likely to be affected, the Goldman Sachs report said, “because the number of jobs in legal services is relatively small and have already been highly exposed to AI”, an author of the study, Manan Raj, told Insider.Paralegals and legal assistants “are responsible for consuming large amounts of information, synthesising what they learned, then making it digestible”. The information they process is “quite amenable to generative AI”, added Madgavkar.Three jobs least at risk from AI1. Medical practitionersAlthough “mundane administrative tasks” in healthcare can be automated, said Forbes, “most adults want to hear about their health from a human”, said David Dranove, a professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, to Kellogg Insight.One “insulated category” comprises “jobs that require sophisticated interpersonal relationships”, said author Martin Ford to BBC Worklife. Nursing is an example, and those who occupy such roles need “a very deep understanding of people”, he added.“There’s a need for compassion in communication that AI is unable to contribute,” Dranove added.2. Skilled trade jobsAnother category relatively safe from the influence of AI is “skilled trades jobs” including people like electricians, plumbers, welders, and other roles, said Ford to CBS News. These are jobs in which “you have a need for lots of dexterity and mobility and unpredictable environments”.These jobs are “probably the hardest of anything to automate”, he added to BBC Worklife, also telling CBS News: “We need a very, very sophisticated science fiction-level robot to do what an electrician does.”3. Creative rolesAlthough generative AI is centred around generating content like text and imagery, Ford told BBC Worklife that people in the creative industries aren’t doing “formulaic work or just rearranging things”. Instead, they are “genuinely coming up with new ideas and building something new”, with AI unable to replicate this trait.Although some creative roles like graphic design and visual art “may be among the first to go”, there’s “security” in alternative kinds of creativity, he added, especially “people whose job is coming up with a new legal strategy or business strategy”.

“After Warhol, what uses are sufficiently ‘transformative’? Answers to [that and a number of other] questions are likely to impact the fair use analysis as applied to generative AI platforms.”

Midjourney prompt: “warhol’s ghost in the machine sci fi”
On May 18, 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court answered an exceedingly narrow question of copyright law with potentially sweeping impact: did the purpose and character of Andy Warhol’s below ‘Orange Prince’ work—as used on a 2016 Condé Nast magazine cover—support fair use of Lynn Goldsmith’s photograph of famed musician Prince Rogers Nelson a/k/a Prince?
In a 7-2 decision, the Court found that it does not, calling into question nearly 30 years of fair use jurisprudence, arguably narrowing the scope of that doctrine, and potentially threatening disciplines that rely on it, e.g., appropriation art. The decision is also sure to impact generative artificial intelligence (“AI”), an emerging technology that is also likely to rely heavily on fair use.
The Warhol Decision
Andy Warhol died in 1987, but his copyrighted works live on. Today, those works are licensed by The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. (“AWF”). In 2016, AWF licensed to Condé Nast Warhol’s ‘Orange Prince,’ an unpublished, unlicensed silkscreen artwork of Lynn Goldsmith’s 1981 black-and-white photograph, to use on a magazine cover to memorialize Prince. Goldsmith objected to ‘Orange Prince’ after learning of it from the commemorative issue, AWF responded with a declaratory judgment action, and Goldsmith counterclaimed for infringement. The district court found for AWF on fair use grounds, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed, and the U.S. Supreme Court—faced with the narrow question of whether the first fair use factor favored Goldsmith or AWF—affirmed the Second Circuit’s ruling.
The majority and dissenting opinions starkly disagree on how to apply the fair use factors. Whereas the dissent focuses on the purpose and character of Warhol’s creation of Goldsmith’s photo to create ‘Orange Prince,’ the majority all but disregards it, and relies on the purpose and character of AWF’s licensing of ‘Orange Prince’ for use as a magazine cover. And whereas the majority finds that the mere addition of new expression cannot sway the first factor in a copyist’s favor without swallowing the author’s derivative works right, the dissent posits that the fourth factor— the effect on the author’s potential market for the work—addresses that concern.
Warhol raises many questions. After Warhol, what uses are sufficiently “transformative”? Does Warhol square with the Court’s 2021 copyright fair use decision in Oracle v. Google? And does it square with the Second Circuit’s decisions in the Author’s Guild and HathiTrust cases (which the Court tacitly endorsed when it declined to grant certiorari in Author’s Guild)? Answers to those questions are likely to impact the fair use analysis as applied to generative AI platforms.
What is Generative AI? 
Generative AI refers to services comprised of algorithms that users can interact with to create content. A hallmark of these generative AI models is their “training” with huge datasets, i.e., millions if not billions of images, in an iterative process whereby the generative AI model “learns” to generate increasingly accurate images in response to text prompts. Critically, some of the most popular generative AI text-to-image models have been trained on unlicensed datasets.
Artists use generative AI to create images in various ways. Some engage in a collaborative process involving iterative re-submission of AI-generated images to the generative AI platform. Others take an AI-generated image and modify it with traditional graphic design tools. Still others use AI-generated images as inspiration to create new works using non-AI tools. In each case, however, users benefit from a generative AI platform that may be “trained” on unlicensed images.
Copyright Fair Use in the Generative AI Context
Recent litigation involving generative AI platforms suggests that the scope of fair use will undoubtedly be an issue to consider. In its motion to dismiss a copyright infringement complaint over its use of unlicensed training sets, Midjourney, Inc. referred to its “obvious fair use defenses” to copyright infringement. Yet, following the Supreme Court’s Warhol decision, exactly how “obvious” is that defense?
Before Warhol, it seemed likely that a court could find the creation of a generative AI platform using unlicensed training data to be insulated by fair use; arguably, the use of content to “train” a platform that generates content is precisely the kind of “highly creative and innovative” use that courts have found transformative. Google LLC v. Oracle Am., Inc., 141 S. Ct. 1183, 1203 (2021). In fact, if Google’s searchable databases are transformative, one could reasonably argue that generative AI text prompts—much like word searches—must also have a different “purpose, character, expression, meaning, and message from the [work] from which [they are] drawn” and are thus “quintessentially transformative use[s].” Authors Guild v. Google, Inc., 804 F.3d 202, 217 (2d Cir. 2015) (quoting Authors Guild, Inc. v. HathiTrust, 755 F.3d 87, 97 (2d Cir. 2014)).
Warhol, however, complicates that analysis. In Warhol, the Court, applying the first fair use factor, held the purpose and character of Warhol’s ‘Orange Prince’ was similar to Goldsmith’s, as both works were licensed for use in popular magazines. Does that mean that a plaintiff artist can defeat a generative AI platform’s fair use defense by licensing his or her work to similar generative AI platforms? Or by pointing to other artists that have licensed their work to generative AI platforms? This, together with the Court’s admonition that a “transformative” use must “go beyond that required to qualify as a derivative” suggests that using an identical work, commercially, to do something that artists can and have already licensed, raises serious doubts about the strength of fair use as a defense to allegedly infringing creations of generative AI platforms.
Warhol’s Ghost Looms Large
Warhol’s work, as well as his posthumous celebrity status (which, given his oeuvre, is nothing short of ironic) continue to influence modern culture and push boundaries, most recently by testing the limits of copyright fair use. Not surprisingly, Warhol’s image, work, style, and legacy has also found its way into generative AI. Were he still alive today, chances are that Andy Warhol would himself be experimenting with generative AI. Fortunately for us, generative AI gives us a nearly limitless opportunity to experiment with Warhol.

While HR functions are still in their nascent stages to harness the impact of AI, the early adopters of the technology have seen a monumental impact on business outcomes. Especially, when it comes to recruitment, back in 2017, costs pre-screen decreased by 75% as a result of the implementation of AI recruiting software. Chatbots, AI-powered ATS, and AI-enabled skill assessment are some of the popular AI recruitment technologies that organisations have been experimenting with to streamline or automate some parts of the recruiting workflow, especially repetitive, high-volume tasks. The tech has also been successful in supporting recruiters with screening for reduced bias, as well as visibility into past successful candidates that have remained at the organisation.In this series of Tech-Wise, we will look at how AI has proved to be an impactful force in the space of recruitment and how Generative AI further will prove to be a game-changer in recruiting and retaining talent. To better showcase these use cases, we have used ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Cohere Generate.First, and foremost how generative AI is different from earlier versions of AI?Generative AI is a next-generation conversational AI that distinguishes itself from the earlier versions of AI and chatbots by being able to provide a very genuine and human-like conversational experience.Not only this feature can help create a great experience for candidates but also help improve speed and efficiency which is integral to creating a more personalised candidate experience.Here are some use cases on how generative AI can be used to hire talent:Write job descriptions or adsGenerative AI can offer ready-to-use job descriptions to be posted on recruitment. If you are time-pressurised and need to get a good quality job ad up fast, or working as a recruiter but not a natural writer, generative AI is a very useful tool to have. We used ChatGPT as a tool to create a job description for a mid-senior-level business development professional.             Candidate assessmentGenerative AI can be used to develop more sophisticated candidate assessments based on the role you are hiring for and the specific skills and competencies that you need. By creating customised tests, simulations, or case studies, AI can help you evaluate your candidates' skills and abilities more accurately. This can help you identify top talent more accurately and make more informed, data-driven decisions hiring decisions.Write candidate outreach copyWe used another Generative AI tool, Cohere Generate to generate text. We added our request, and typical job details like compensation, and work timings which are some of the first few questions that candidates ask regarding a job. Below you can find the end result. To make the email more coherent, you can also add the job description to the request.    Create your EVP messagingFor writing the EVP, we used Google Bard. As you can see, the EVP it created is detailed, convincing, and inspiring and met the standard of the typical middle-of-the-range EVP we usually see out there. You could use it as is at a stretch, but most likely you would use it as a starting template, and this could save time in the hiring value chain.One of the things that we noticed in Google Bard is that it also shares suggestions to make content more detailed and make it more aligned with your needs. It also shares alternative drafts which you can select content from different drafts and curate that suits your needs.      Improve your D&amp;I quotient in hiringDE&amp;I remains one of the top priorities for talent teams. One of the challenges in DE&amp;I hiring is the reach of job posts to the desired candidates. Generative AI can support your job descriptions and messaging by estimating which terms are inclusive and what language must be avoided at all costs.AI is reshaping the way that people work, and clearly, it is also influencing who companies choose to hire. The ways in which AI will continue to foster change are limitless. However, we must lean on these tools responsibly.",,,,,,,"{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://hrme.economictimes.indiatimes.com/search/{query}', 'query-input': 'required name=query'}",,,emea@ethrworld.com,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'Place', 'address': 'Times Internet Limited (Times Center), FC - 6, Sector 16 A, Film City, Noida - 201301 Uttar Pradesh, India'}",,,,,,,

Despite widespread hysteria that artificial intelligence will make most of our jobs irrelevant, it could actually streamline the workflow for plenty of professions—including music production. We chose a couple of our favorite tools for simplifying music production and put them to the test, demonstrating a real-world scenario in which this technology could be used for good instead of evil. It’s time we embrace this new technology as a helping hand rather than disavow it as a doomsday device, and we hope this guide will help you get your feet wet.What’s The Deal With AI Music Generators?It’s important to note that some of these programs can generate music—but we’re still far from being able to push a button to churn out a one-hit-wonder. The AI music generators we tested are legitimate tools, unlike the voice changers you may have seen that can make anyone sound like Drake. (The New York Times recently chronicled an AI Drake hit that briefly went viral before being stripped from streaming services, and spoiler alert, he was not happy.)Messing around with Riffusion, it didn’t take long to realize that none of the music is necessarily Spotify ready out of the box—I guess it also helps to have even a lick of musical talent. However, this basic idea made me realize that these programs are helpful for ideation in song creation, and not necessarily “cheating” and doing the musician’s whole job. Most of these tools are much simpler to use than ChatGPT, Midjourney, and some of the other models we’ve written about previously.  ✅ How Do AI Music Generators Work? Much like AI image generators and text-based AI tools, AI music generators rely on deep learning—a machine learning method in which computers process data in a way that mimics the human mind—to create an output. Specifically, the software must be fed vast amounts of training data (here, examples of music) and process it. But if you only teach the system with the greatest hits from the Beatles, for instance, any melody that the AI music generator would produce after that training period would sound a whole hell of a lot like ... the Beatles. That’s why a huge library of training data, from varied sources, is key to this process. RiffusionThis super lightweight web app was one of the first AI music models I began playing around with. Using Stable Diffusion—yes, the same platform that creates images—Riffusion is able to create an image that’s then synthesized to create “music.” I use the quotations there sparingly as many of the ideas it spits out are not only low-fidelity but also quite basic. However, it can absolutely provide a musician with a cool riff or beat that they could use in their work. The white slab that you see to the left of the screen is the image Riffusion synthesizes. The app analyzes the peaks and valleys, and proceeds to translate the physical form into music the same way a record player interprets sound from the ridges on vinyl. Along with the prompts (see the photo above for an example), I also have control over melodic patterns, creativity, tempo, and that’s about it.Nothing special, but it’s more than enough to get the creative juices flowing. ChatGPT Despite some of the sillier things I’ve asked ChatGPT to do, it didn’t take me long to realize that it could actually be another incredibly useful tool for musicians looking to find samples—and even lyrics. Sure, most of its training data is from 2021 and earlier, but this isn’t a big issue as there’s a plethora of great tunes to choose from that predate even the 21st century. As you’ll see below, I asked it for five samples with similar vibes to Tijuana Brass. Along with finding samples, it’s also a great tool for writing lyrics. They’re not perfect, but with a little human intervention, the lyrics below are a great springboard for writing a country song about Formula 1.Samplette.io While ChatGPT is a great starting point for finding new music, Samplette IO gives you more control over the results. Instead of aimlessly sifting through YouTube, this app gives you eight filters to tune your search results—genre, style, country, key, tempo, vocality, views, and year—and find exactly what you want. It also includes a keyword section to further narrow down your findings.Samplette is also a super useful tool for finding new music. I’ve also never had to skip through ads while listening to music—make of that information what you will. Don’t tell Spotify, but I’ve found Samplette’s algorithm way better at finding fresh music. I generally just leave it on shuffle while I’m working. Isn’t This Copyright Infringement?AI anything becomes considerably more complex regarding intellectual property, especially when it comes to music. (This article from The Verge provides deeper context into the seemingly endless gray areas of musical copyright, and how we should proceed into an era where AI-assisted music generation is likely here to stay.)Generative AI models—including music generators—must be trained with existing material. This is often conflated with stealing content, but there’s really no other way for these programs to generate music. It’s not dissimilar to how humans wouldn’t be able to make music without hearing it first. You’re not necessarily stealing it, but are instead riffing from other works.It’s comparable to how samples—notes and melodies taken from other songs to spruce up someone else’s work—play out in the music industry. Copyright laws regarding samples sound incredibly simple, given that artists need explicit permission to use someone else’s work. However, this is actually where things get incredibly complicated. Can you copyright a chord progression? How similar does one song have to be to raise a red flag? Who decides how similar two works actually are? Earlier this year, for instance, Ed Sheeran was cleared of any wrongdoing after claims that his original song, “Thinking Out Loud,” strayed too close to Marvin Gaye’s “Let’s Get It On.” In the case of AI music, the situation is ongoing. That being said, the use of copyrighted music to train these models is currently the biggest rock in most musicians’ shoes.  Other ApplicationsWhile AI music is mostly a gimmick at the moment, we reckon that it could soon revolutionize the production process for small filmmakers—among many others use cases. These collectives often have very little budget to spare for creating a score to complement their films.In my couple of weeks with these programs, it’s clear that AI music-making has a very long way to go before Hollywood’s score composers have to start worrying about their job security. AI tools can give you a fairly good product, but most of the programs I used gave me limited control of the finished product; you’re unable to change individual notes and chord progressions, and are instead able to tweak the mood, dynamics, and lyrics.Going ForwardMuch like the other AI tools that we’ve written about, music generators aren’t anything to panic about. They’re great for messing around, and can give you good results, but they still can’t compete with the creativity and intricacies of a human being composing a song or playing an instrument. I do wonder if artists and composers could start using these tools for inspiration in the not-so-distant future.

Sensors and internet-of-things (IoT) are delving into our lives more rapidly than we realise. Governments, financial institutions and big industries are relying on cyber-physical systems for their day-to-day activities. The question, however, is how long before the institutions become too dependent on it?Given the tremendous progress of AI in speech and language processing, computer vision, etc, it is conceivable that in the near future, almost any task that is “measurable’’ will be taken over b y AI. The increasing success of AI in super-skilled application scenarios such as in medical and legal domains clearly reinforce this trend. Even in tasks that are considered to be purely based on human creativity, such as writing poetry, painting, and composing music, success of AI is impressive and worrying to many who practise it. What then will be left for humans in the future? The answer probably lies in the way current AI models are designed. At their heart, they are mathematical tools, albeit too complex for humans to explain. This, therefore, leads to the conclusion that anything that can be “measured’’ in terms of numbers can be solved by AI models. Thus, humans may not be required for these so-called “left-brain’’ functions. This disruption calls for a massive re-skilling of the human population. Humans should focus on developing and utilising right-brain skills, such as critical thinking, creativity, emotional intelligence, and empathy. These skills are difficult for AI to replicate and will become increasingly valuable in the future of work. We should focus on developing skills that complement AI technology, such as data analysis and programming, as well as skills that involve human interaction, such as customer service and healthcare. Ultimately, humans need to be flexible, adaptable, and have a zeal to continuously learn to thrive in a world with AI technology.Instead of worrying about jobs being taken over by AI, we should focus on the tasks that AI will be fulfilling. We’ve already been using AI features like auto-correct and auto-complete. AI will take care of grunt work and save time. We need to learn how to use AI effectively and diversify our work requirements.AI may open up newer avenues or scopes of learning and employment. Rather than fearing the changes brought by AI, students and young engineers should embrace the opportunities it presents.As AI is taking over the academic sphere as well, we might probably have to wait for a decisive overhaul of education. Educational institutions would need to incorporate AI into the curriculum like other mandatory subjects, provide opportunities for students to work on AI-related projects, and develop programmes that teach skills that are difficult for AI to replicate, such as creativity and emotional intelligence. In addition, educational institutions need to focus on developing lifelong learning skills and promote a culture of continuous learning, as the skills required in the workforce will continue to evolve and change as AI technology advances.The youth of today stand at the threshold of several unprecedented challenges both in terms of technology as well as societal and ethical values that are set to disrupt the world order. Summits like the Y20 Summit by the Union ministry of youth affairs and sports can be some pertinent platforms to involve the youth in these crucial discussions and collectively seek ideas and recommendations for the future of work.Arnab Bhattacharya is professor in the department of computer science and engineering at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur ",,,,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-100864265,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-4548,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'android-app://com.toi.reader.activities/toi.index.deeplink/t/a/100864261'}",,,,

With the fast-paced growth of IT, technology today plays a lot more than just being an enabler in our lives. It is now an integral part of us that transforms our lifestyle and everyday activities, giving it a digital makeover. And, startups have played a key role in propagating tech-led solutions. One such example is bigbasket, which has transformed the way a common man shops for daily groceries and monthly supplies. Rakshit Daga, Chief Technology Officer, bigbasket, in an exclusive interview with Express Computer, opens up on the evolving technologies and their impact on startups today. He also sheds light on how bigbasket is leveraging new-gen technologies to strengthen the business and serve customers better.
As post-Covid, the value of technology was well realised and everyone took the digital route, how has this massive shift affected the startup ecosystem in the country? How has this change impacted bigbasket?
The massive shift towards digitalisation due to the Covid-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the startup ecosystem in India. It has accelerated the adoption of technology across various sectors, including e-commerce and grocery delivery. For companies like bigbasket, this shift has presented both challenges and opportunities. On one hand, there has been a surge in demand for online grocery services, leading to increased growth and expansion opportunities. On the other hand, the competition has intensified, with new players entering the market. bigbasket has adapted to this change by focusing on enhancing our technology infrastructure, scaling up our operations, and ensuring seamless customer experiences through our digital platform.
I think the hardest nut to crack is customer trust. And this is the case for almost every tech-driven startup today. How is bigbasket leveraging technology to build trust and ensure quality and timely delivery?
Building and maintaining customer trust and consistently delivering customer delight is of utmost importance for us as a company. We leverage technology to provide a secure, reliable, and convenient shopping experience for our customers.

We have implemented advanced logistics and delivery systems, enabled by technology, to ensure timely and efficient order fulfillment. On the data security side, we consistently audit and upgrade our technology landscape to make sure we stay on top of all emerging threats.
Though digital is convenient, it is dangerous too. The mobile apps like bigbasket that we use in our everyday life not only hold our address and contact details but also UPI and e-payment data. How important is cybersecurity for bigbasket? What measures are you taking to ensure the prevention of data breaches or other cyber attacks?
Cybersecurity is a critical aspect of our operations at bigbasket. We recognise the importance of protecting customer data and maintaining their trust. We have implemented robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard against data breaches and cyberattacks. This includes stringent access controls, regular security assessments, and vulnerability management practices. We comply with industry standards and regulations regarding data protection. Our dedicated security team constantly monitors and responds to emerging threats, ensuring the highest level of security for our customers’ personal and financial information.
How has AI posed a game-changer for B2C startups like bigbasket? Do you really think a chatbot used for grievance redressal is an effective way to deal with customers’ complaints and resolve issues?
AI has indeed been a game-changer for a company like bigbasket. It has enabled us to enhance customer experiences, streamline operations, and improve overall efficiency. At bigbasket, we leverage AI in various ways, including personalised product recommendations, demand forecasting, and customer support. Our chatbot is an integral part of our customer support system, allowing us to address customer queries and resolve issues promptly. While the chatbot serves as a first point of contact, we also ensure that customers have the option to connect with human representatives for more complex queries. This blended approach has proven effective in providing timely and efficient grievance redressal.
In what ways is bigbasket evolving? How are newer technologies helping you innovate and take approaches that are more efficient and effective?
Bigbasket is continuously evolving to stay ahead in the dynamic market and currently handles nearly 700,000 orders a day. We embrace newer technologies to drive innovation and improve our efficiency and effectiveness. For example, we are leveraging data analytics and machine learning to gain insights into customer preferences, optimise inventory management, and provide personalised recommendations. We are exploring automation and robotics for warehouse operations to enhance efficiency and order accuracy.
Additionally, we are investing in last-mile delivery technologies, including route optimisation and real-time tracking, to ensure faster and more reliable deliveries. These technological advancements enable us to provide a seamless and convenient shopping experience for our customers. 
Finally, we are now packaging all our technology, scale, and process experience and expertise into SAAS products like Transportation Management System (TMS) and Warehouse Management System (WMS)  which are now available for the industry at large.

AI Analyzes the Social Work Licensing Exam, and Concerns Deepen


Using ChatGPT-generated test answers, researchers found the artificial intelligence responses offered “a compelling and sometimes better rationale” than what the official answer key shows.

How should a social worker coaching a domestic violence survivor offer advice about returning to an abusive partner? What are the first steps to help a foster child throwing temper tantrums whose parent is incarcerated? How can they tell if a client is maintaining sobriety?
On these and other questions, Michigan researchers have concluded that a computer-generated model scanning massive online datasets of texts, books, articles and webpages drew more accurate conclusions than the “correct” answers determined by the Association of Social Work Boards, which created and administers licensing exams for the nation’s social workers. 




The findings, published in March by the journal Research on Social Work Practice, concluded that answers that would have been marked incorrect on the exams instead represented a safer and more ethical response — raising fundamental questions about the validity of the test that serves as the gateway to the country’s frontline social service jobs.
“When you asked for the rationale for how the questions were answered when they were ‘incorrect,’ it was perfectly logical,” said one of the study’s authors, Wayne State University School of Social Work Dean Sheryl Kubiak. “Any instructor would have marked it as ‘correct,’ because it was bringing in the context.” 

Sheryl Kubiak
According to the answers to the tests that AI came up with, some “correct” answers relied on dated concepts, or had little evidence to back them up. In other instances, the multiple-choice format failed to offer nuanced and informed approaches to delicate, high-stakes decisions, such as how to approach a deaf client when an interpreter cancels an appointment, or the best way to help children through the death of a parent.
The researchers were so concerned by the findings that their abstract calls on state regulators and legislators to temporarily suspend the exam created and administered by the Association of Social Work Boards, while a more “appropriate, effective, and ethical” test is developed.
They also offer cautious optimism for “generative AI” and “large language models” to inform the field of social work — joining a fast-growing chorus of critics and cheerleaders of computer programs that can simulate human thought processes and creation, methods now reaching into virtually all aspects of society.
In response to The Imprint’s request for comment, leaders of the Association of Social Work Boards (ASWB) said the licensing exams for clinical, bachelor’s and master’s level social work are rigorously vetted. They dismissed the study’s assertion that some of the questions are biased, outdated or based on poorly supported practice.
“Every correct answer is supported by a valid and current social work reference,” Senior Director of Examination Services Lavina Harless said in an email. 

The researchers were so concerned by the findings that their abstract calls on state regulators and legislators to temporarily suspend the exam.

Harless said that the exam questions are “thoroughly and continually reviewed by testing experts” and that any questions that show potential bias or don’t appropriately evaluate social work competency are not included on the final tests.
CEO Stacey Hardy-Chandler also responded by email, stating her organization updates the licensure exams every five to seven years, and that the process involves surveying thousands of social workers to ensure the questions reflect current practice. The association’s next analysis of the exam will begin in 2024. 
“ASWB is taking a rigorous and thoughtful approach to enhancing the licensing exams,” she said, but cautioned about any hasty changes.
“We are committed to being vigilant in our review of all available tools, including emerging technologies such as AI,” she added. “However, it is premature to jump to conclusions about the development of future exams based on the findings of a single study.”

Multiple-choice format eliminates nuance of social work
The study was prompted by alarming racial disparities in the social worker licensing test passing rates revealed last year. The researchers set out to determine if artificial intelligence could suss out potential bias in the questions and “move us toward a more valid and equitable exam.”
Lead author and Wayne State University School of Social Work professor Bryan Victor and his team did not analyze the exam, which is not publicly available. Instead, they relied on an official set of practice questions.
Hardy-Chandler characterized the practice questions as “retired,” and not reflected in the actual exam. But in defending the analysis, Victor noted that the practice questions were pulled from the social work board’s online portal, and they are used by educators preparing students for the licensing exams.
“Our review of available documentation related to these exam questions revealed no indication that these questions are outdated or not aligned with current research, which could potentially mislead educators or students,” Victor wrote in an email.

Bryan Victor
His study relied on ChatGPT for its findings, which the authors describe as “currently taking the world by storm.” The artificial intelligence program was instructed to complete the practice questions for the licensing exam and explain why it selected its answers. This “think aloud” function helped researchers pinpoint potential problems with the questions, and the limited way test-takers could provide appropriate answers, particularly when they could only select one option in a multiple-choice format.
In some cases, the differences between the “correct” answer the ASWB identified and the “incorrect” one ChatGPT produced was a matter of nuance and depth. In one example described by researchers, both answers focused on properly engaging a client at a domestic violence shelter in a discussion about the choice to return to an abusive partner.
“The correct response according to ASWB was to encourage the client to further discuss their decision,” the study states, an answer “consistent with the ethical principle of self-determination.” 
ChatGPT selected a different response that it determined was more accurate. It specified that in discussions over the decision, the client, not the social worker, must guide the conversation. That distinction was key to a more accurate answer, the researchers stated, because the social worker must demonstrate acceptance of the client’s choice, even if it ends up being a return to the abusive partner. 
Doing otherwise, could “create further barriers to the client’s engagement,” the ChatGPT response concluded. “Allowing the client to direct the conversation and to express their thoughts and feelings can help to build trust and rapport between the client and the social worker,” which can increase “the likelihood that the client will be open to receiving support and services, regardless of their decision.”
The computer-generated response stated that the social worker should outline concerns about the risk of returning to the abusive partner, but noted the importance of doing so “in a non-judgmental and supportive manner.”

The multiple-choice format failed to offer nuanced and informed approaches to delicate, high-stakes decisions, such as how to approach a deaf client when an interpreter cancels an appointment.

One of the study’s authors Brian Perron — a professor of social work at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor — described the significance of this analysis in a follow-up article published last month by Towards Data Science: “By neglecting the complexity and context of actual practice, the exam is not adequately assessing the competence of social workers.” Perron concluded that “we have serious reservations about considering the ASWB exam key as the gold standard. The exam has flaws and biases, including using empirically unsupported test items.”
Previous exam controversy
Problems with the social worker licensing exam date back to at least 2010, when a study concluded it evaluated test-taking abilities more than competency to practice. And last year, a study published by the Association of Social Work Boards about its own licensing exam revealed gaping disparities in the pass rates based on race, age and native language. The study revealed that just 45% of Black test-takers passed the exam on the first try, compared with 84% of white test-takers. The disparity remained consistent on follow-up attempts, with 91% of white people eventually passing the test, compared to 57% of Black people. 
The ability to score well on standardized tests has long been found to reflect societal bias, pushing out people of color from success on qualifying exams for everything from college admission to the legal and pharmaceutical fields. According to a 2021 article published by the National Education Association, standardized tests “have been instruments of racism and a biased system.” 
Not every state requires social workers to pass an exam and receive a license to practice, but many do. And even when a license is not required, it can give social workers a strong advantage for upward mobility in their careers. 
The pass-rate disparity data rocked the social work field, confirming longstanding concerns about the consequential licensing exams. 
“It was both horrible, but also validating,” said Anthony Estreet, CEO of the National Association of Social Workers. “Validating the concerns that people have had for years in terms of the bias that is in the exam, but also validating to those that have failed the exam that it’s not them.”
Adding to the critiques, earlier this year the National Association of Social Workers — representing more than 100,000 members — announced formal opposition to the licensing exams. The influential body called for alternatives that promote “the diversity and well-being of the social work profession, and the health and well-being of the populations social workers serve.”
“An entirely new era”
Artificial intelligence is the latest tool to be used in a critique of the social work licensing exam. 
With its ability to mimic human output based on analysis of vast amounts of online data, AI has its own set of controversies — from privacy violations to job-loss driven by automation, the spread of misinformation and algorithmic bias. With sufficient regulation and used in proper ways, the method is also considered to be a powerful and effective tool, supporters argue.
The Michigan researchers decided to analyze the social work licensing exam with AI after learning of similar analyses conducted on the bar exam and medical licensing tests for doctors. On both, computer systems received high marks.
“We recognize this is an entirely new era of rapidly growing technologies, which necessarily requires the field to be cautious moving forward,” the Michigan researchers state. “Importantly, we want to be clear that we see generative AI models as tools that can help social workers, but we do not think these tools can replace social workers.”

“We want to be clear that we see generative AI models as tools that can help social workers, but we do not think these tools can replace social workers.”
From the report, “Time to Move Beyond the ASWB Licensing Exams”
They go on to state some possible ways the emerging technology can inform the field.
For example, the authors describe a section of the social worker practice exam that presents a scenario and asks test-takers to select from four possible responses as to what the social worker should do “next” or “first.” 
In it, a foster child has an incarcerated father and a mother in a residential treatment program for alcoholism. The child is described as small for his age, behind on his speech, behind on schoolwork and throwing temper tantrums.
ChatGPT did not select any of the four responses provided on the practice test, which included “screen for fetal alcohol syndrome, develop a behavior modification plan, refer to special education, or pursue family reunification.”
Instead, it offered an answer that was not provided: The social worker should “gather more information and assess the child’s needs.” A comprehensive assessment would best determine the child’s developmental, behavioral and educational needs, as well as any past trauma or neglect, the computer-assisted program determined. Only then could the social worker decide on the appropriate interventions, such as a medical referral, special education services, working with foster parents on a behavior plan, or focusing on reunification with the biological mother, if appropriate. 
“We think the response of ChatGPT is the better answer — as do our colleagues with clinical expertise who we consulted — because the scenario does not contain enough contextual information to make an informed decision,” the Michigan study authors concluded. 
Another example when ChatGPT provided a different answer than ASWB developers involved a question about the “most likely emotional response” when adult children learn of a parent’s Alzheimer’s diagnosis. The computer-generated response determined “a range of emotional reactions” are likely. “Denial” was the correct test answer — based on the “five stages of grief” introduced by psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross in 1969. “ASWB’s correct answer does not have sufficient empirical support to inform practice,” the Michigan study authors concluded, noting that health researchers have cautioned against the continued use of the Kübler-Ross model, which is widely considered to be outdated.

Brian Perron
Professor Perron said inadequate context is a fundamental weakness of an exam based on just one correct answer that assesses the ability to perform a skill as subjective as social work. For that reason, he said, older test-takers whose answers may incorporate years of real-world professional and life experience are more likely to struggle with the ASWB exam format, compared with a recent graduate who is answering solely based on their classroom training. 
Kubiak, who co-chairs the National Association of Deans and Directors of Schools of Social Work’s task force on the licensure exam, said people of color also bring a different perspective and set of experiences to social work scenarios that may not be captured or fairly assessed in the current licensing exam.
As a potential remedy, the research trio tested ChatGPT’s ability to “grade” short-answer questions. They fed the program a sample question, along with three potential responses, instructing it to determine which of the answers reflected safe and ethical social work practice. They reported that AI was able to do so, correctly identifying a plan to refer a queer client to conversion therapy as “harmful.” 
The researchers conclude the takeaway from this exercise was that shifting to a short-answer exam could better include the important context missing from the current multiple-choice format. 
Yet as with other data applications in social work, such as predictive analytics, artificial intelligence must be fully analyzed before it is put to use more broadly in the human services field, the researchers concluded, “because generative AI models are just in their infancy and still prone to frequent errors.”

Of primary concern are the massive amounts of internet data AI relies on to form its “intelligence.” Any bias that exists in that data is baked into its output. Mindful of this, the Michigan researchers state, if AI is to be used in future redesigns of the social work licensing exam, it would require experts collaborating with computer scientists to build in guardrails. 
“We’re a long way off from using AI in any kind of testing context,” Victor said in an interview. “We just wanted to put it on the table as one potential path forward that we think is worth exploring.”

The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment has banned staff from using artificial intelligence technology such as ChatGPT - citing data and privacy risks.
Similar action has been taken overseas by a number of large banks and technology companies, including Apple and Samsung.
New Zealand remains without government-wide rules or guidelines for ministries and agencies' use of artificial intelligence.
Privacy concerns prompt proceed with caution warning
Documents show that in March, MBIE blocked staff access to a number of AI tools including ChatGPT.
The ministry was worried staff could put sensitive information into the technology which could later resurface.
MBIE has hit the pause button while it works out if the technology can be used safely.
University of Auckland senior law lecturer and AI law expert Nikki Chamberlain said caution was prudent.
""It's a new technology and we don't know the consequences of it yet.
""And only time is going to be able to tell whether the information that you're putting in there is going to be protected and private.""
In New Zealand there is no AI-specific regulation or legislation, and internal MBIE documents say there are ""no rules or guidelines for all government agencies about staff use [of] AI tools"".
A spokesperson for the Government Chief Digital Officer in the Department of Internal Affairs said the government was working on guidance for agencies which it expected to have soon.
It said its own DIA staff have not been banned from using AI tools.
Privacy Commissioner Michael Webster said it was up to individual government agencies and companies to decide if, and how, they use AI.
""And if the risks are too high then my expectation would be that they won't proceed with that proposal.""
Frith Tweedie from consultancy firm Simply Privacy said staff needed guidance and safeguards.
""I don't think it is unreasonable to pause while you are working that out, I think all of the government agencies should be forming a position on what's appropriate and inappropriate use.
""And for some of them a full ban might be appropriate to for those that are dealing with particular sensitive information.""
Many companies overseas ban staff from using AI
ChatGPT is trained by being fed the internet and, by predicting the next word in a sequence, it spits out full sentence answers to questions.
It contains masses of unvetted information and it is essentially a locked box - once information has been put in, it is all but impossible to get out again.
Canada's privacy watchdog has launched an investigation into OpenAI about its Chat GPT technology, and Italy briefly banned the use of the product over privacy concerns.
Many international companies have banned or restricted staff from using the technology including Apple, Samsung, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs.
AI legislation needed
Last month OpenAI tightened up some of ChatGPT's privacy settings, but the adjustments are tacked on, and privacy questions remain.
""I'm certainly recommending that organisations and individuals ... take care, definitely turn off the chat history, but even so I would avoid entering any confidential information or any personal information,"" Tweedie said.
Europe has much more stringent privacy laws and far higher sanctions than in Aotearoa.
Chamberlain said New Zealand needed legislation covering AI.
""Until we have laws around regulating the use of AI, and information that is held by AI, and then how that information can be used going forward, we just need to be really careful.""
In the meantime, late last month the Privacy Commissioner issued advice for agencies and businesses to use the technology.
That includes staff considering whether it is necessary and proportionate to use AI at all.
He said firms and government agencies should do a privacy risk impact assessment to work out the danger areas to avoid.
He wants the public and private sector to work together to come with advice for how best to use the technology safely.

However, opinions vary by seniority and by country, according to the survey by Boston Consulting Group.

The survey is based on inputs from 12,800 employees from the executive suites to the frontline employees across industries in 18 countries.

As per the survey, Brazil (71 per cent) is the most optimistic country about the impact of GenAI on workplace followed by India (60 per cent) and the Middle East (58 per cent).

The least optimistic are the US (46 per cent), the Netherlands (44 per cent) and Japan (40 per cent).

Geographies most concerned about AI are the Netherlands (42 per cent), France (41 per cent), and Japan (38 per cent), while the least concerned are the Middle East (25 per cent), Brazil (19 per cent), and India (14 per cent),

As much as 61 per cent of the 1,000 respondents in India are optimistic about the tool while 72.8 per cent of them believe the rewards of GenAI outweigh risks.

Also, close to 88 per cent of respondents believe their job is likely to be transformed by AI and 80 per cent feel AI-specific regulations are necessary.

GenAI is a rapidly evolving space, and its transformative impact is already being felt in workplaces around the world, says Nicolas De Bellefonds, the global leader of AI and software at BCG X, BCG's tech build and design unit.

As per the survey, 52 per cent of respondents are optimistic about AI's impact on work, which was 35 per cent in 2018.

According to Nipun Kalra, managing director &amp; partner, and head of BCG X in India, among the 18 countries surveyed, Indian executives are the most optimistic about the transformative impact of AI.

The survey also showed that senior leaders are more frequent users of generative AI, and thus are more optimistic and less concerned about it than frontline employees. While 62 per cent of leaders are optimistic about AI, only 42 per cent of frontline employees share that view.

Also, 62 per cent of regular users of GenAI are optimistic about it, compared to 36 per cent of non-users. A majority of leaders (80 per cent) report that they use GenAI tools regularly, compared with just 20 per cent of frontline employees.

Further, frontline employees made up the largest percentage of non-users (60 per cent).

Globally, more than a third of the respondents (36 per cent) think that their job is likely to be eliminated by AI and 86 per cent believe they will need skilling.
