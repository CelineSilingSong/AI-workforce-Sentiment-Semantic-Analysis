Among them is a solid conceptual framework to help underline the benefits for armed forces. Second, AI solutions need to be integrated into a complex web of legacy systems, which puts a premium on interoperability. Third, defense AI solutions must comply with legal requirements. Finally, Europe lacks a common, trusted defense data pool.European leaders should take a lesson from the military mobility project, which simplifies and standardizes cross-border military transport procedures to ease the movement of personnel and equipment. Europe needs to match physical mobility with digital mobility. Data needs to travel, too.To stimulate defense AI solutions, the continent needs a platform economy that emerges around a portfolio of relevant infrastructure elements and services that a new “Center for Defense AI” could build.For the platform to become attractive, the data acquisition strategy must focus on the need to share. Readiness to share must be incentivized by a data pool that offers true, added value. Therefore, the center would offer access to data on anything from missile defense to combat aircraft maintenance under strict, government-controlled regulation, enabling users to build novel use cases for military scenarios.RELATEDWho should manage the Pentagon’s AI data? DARPA’s director has a suggestion.Artificial intelligence can't be ""owned"" by any one entity at the Defense Department, said the head of DARPA. But there does need to be one central hub to manage all of the data supporting AI across the military, he added.By Jill AitoroMission-critical systems cannot rely on a single machine-learning technology but require a combined approach to data fusion that increases reliability and reflects the specific requirements of the different domains like land, sea, air, space and cyberspace. In addition, data must be validated to avoid manipulation.This data pool would become enormously attractive if the center managed to establish arrangements with the European Union and NATO to share data collected in international operations. This would provide an unprecedented opportunity to develop future concepts, models and algorithms based on real-life data reflecting mission requirements, environmental conditions in different theaters of operation and adversarial behavior.In addition, the European Defence Agency and NATO’s Science and Technology Organization should make use of the joint data pool for their defense AI projects, thus expanding the data pool as well as the concepts and models used for data curation and solutions development.With the help of the European Defence Fund, the center could establish the first European defense data pool spanning across military services, missions and domains. This will drastically reduce data-handling costs, as data curation activities required for every single defense AI project can be pooled.While hugely important, data is only a means to develop capabilities-based AI solutions. That’s why the center would offer complementary services addressing two current shortfalls: First, commonly available computing capacity required for large-scale learning is somewhat novel to the defense industry. A new defense AI cloud would significantly enhance data mobility by offering elastic computing capacity up to supercomputer levels, and dedicated data fusion capabilities currently unavailable to train very large-scale, AI-based data fusion models.Second, the center could provide a sophisticated simulation environment to run AI operations in a realistic battlefield environment. Based on its trusted data sources, the center and defense AI developers could join forces to build a defense AI app store. Apps could capture different sensor and effector characteristics or emulate particular patterns of adversarial behavior.Defense contractors and defense procurement agencies could use these apps to verify and validate new AI systems as if they had access to the respective algorithms, but without exposing the original vendor to the risk of being reverse engineered.In addition, the simulation environment would be instrumental to assess the ethical, legal and societal impact of AI solutions, thus providing a sound basis to decide on the use of AI systems and to enhance live, virtual, constructive training solutions.Europe should take bold steps toward channeling its collaborative defense AI activities, building on the strengths of each partner: The center would offer joint services; defense AI developers could concentrate on designing and producing intelligent sensors, effectors and decision-making solutions, while military end-users would contribute capabilities-based thinking and operational experience.Heiko Borchert runs Borchert Consulting & Research, a strategic affairs consultancy based in Lucerne, Switzerland.

Rewards and risks in humanitarian AI: an example

6 September 2019, Data and digitalization / New technologies / Restoring family links 




 
4 min
New technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, can make humanitarian work better, faster and more effective, but there are dangers too, which is why the ICRC is proceeding with caution. Various departments across the ICRC – among them Digital Transformation & Data, Protection, Information and Communication Technology, Law and Policy – are grappling with these innovations and their implications in different ways. Here we look at one example.
When the ICRC recently began testing artificial intelligence (AI) to help reunite lost loved-ones in the wake of the European migration crisis, it represented a breakthrough technological opportunity. The ICRC’s pioneering Trace the Face website was already helping people who were looking for their missing relatives to post their own photo online in hopes of being recognized and reconnected. Recently, the application of artificial intelligence for facial recognition to automate searching and matching is revealing further potential of new technology to accelerate one of the ICRC’s core activities.
“This was the starting point of our exploration,” says the ICRC’s Strategic Technology Advisor Vincent Graf Narbel. “What if we could improve the work of our field colleagues and provide a way to assist them by matching people’s faces using AI facial recognition techniques?”
Not long ago, separated family members had to sift through pages of photographs in physical books but that is changing, fast. The ICRC’s current database of people separated in the escape from war and hardship, part of which is accessible through Trace the Face website and touchscreen kiosks known as Trace the Face Corners, is helping to speed up this process and reunite more families than ever before.
“Trace the Face was the starting point,” says Graf Narbel. “The objective has shifted now to something much broader.”
Reuniting victims of war all over the world is among the ICRC’s most important functions, and remains even more so as the number of lost, disappeared, and missing continues to grow.
Informing these continued efforts is the evolution of projects such as AI for facial recognition that is revealing a range of new questions and challenges coexisting with the potential benefits of this brave new world.
Power and pitfalls
As seen in the trial for Trace the Face, AI-based facial recognition and name processing and matching technologies have obvious applications in filtering the database for duplicates and connections, so what’s the problem?
“Just because you can do something, it doesn’t mean you should,” says Graf Narbel. “There are data protection issues that are very specific to the ICRC.”
With Trace the Face, no photo can be published without the individual’s consent. But there is much personal data in the world that does not have consent, is not protected, and can be open to use – including abuse – by third parties.
This is a grave concern. “We have to be very cautious with our metadata and database security,” says Graf Narbel. “The question is how we can leverage these technologies while safeguarding the personal data of individuals – a critical aspect of protecting their rights – and adhering to International Humanitarian Law. We are exploring the power and pitfalls of technology.”
That exploration is simultaneously underway across other parts of the ICRC, including in relation to humanitarian law and policy, and armed conflict.
Do no digital harm
Working solely within its own database is one way the ICRC can ensure that protection standards are upheld, but this also means ignoring a plethora of other potential sources – such as Facebook or similar social media platforms – that could make finding the missing more successful.
The ICRC has always been concerned with protecting the people it serves from the physical dangers implicit in surviving conflicts, crises and disasters, but nowadays there is the new threat of virtual risk leading to actual physical harm.
In June, the ICRC published ‘Artificial intelligence and machine learning in armed conflict: A human-centered approach’, a report seeking to identify the potential risks as new technologies are applied in conflict scenarios.
“At a time of increasing conflict and rapid technological change, the ICRC needs both to understand the impact of new technologies on people affected by armed conflict and to design humanitarian solutions that address the needs of the most vulnerable,” the report states.
It is in this context of caution, thoughtfulness and a willingness to go slowly to get it right that the ICRC is seeking to situate its own application of artificial intelligence and machine learning. “There is a growing recognition of the power of technology to improve the work, but also a recognition of the dangers of technology to the people we’re serving,” says Graf Narbel.

About five years ago, I was the vice president of data for Kickstarter. People would come to the crowdfunding platform with wild ideas—before I got hired there, I used Kickstarter to raise funds for a translation of Moby-Dick into emoji—and company staff got to decide which projects could solicit money from the public. For those working on the Kickstarter projects team, being able to see an obviously worthy idea, and approve it five seconds later, was a total blast. In the early days, it felt like everyone at the company was competing to see what kind of fun and interesting projects we could recruit to our platform.But as the number of inventors and artists seeking money on Kickstarter exploded, the projects team needed an automated solution to help process the influx of new ideas during surge periods. Holiday weekends were especially difficult, as the projects team’s queue would back up with hundreds of worthy projects. Those delays began frustrating creators who were waiting for the team to approve their proposals. So I oversaw the development of an automated system that would consider each product’s stated purpose, its creator’s past record of success, and other factors, and fast-track the most promising ones.To read this story, Sign in or start a subscription.CloseNever miss a story.

L’Oréal’s Technology Incubator

L’Oréal’s first incubator lab was located in New Jersey, but it now also operates additional labs in San Francisco, Paris, and Tokyo that are focused on a small number of products—a mix of apps and wearables and objects to help cosmetics be connected and customized to meet the specific needs of each customer. The incubator partners with entrepreneurs and academia to develop the latest and greatest products by using technology.

Makeup Genius

In 2015, the incubator launched the Makeup Genius, a mobile app that allows customers to see hair color and makeup on their own face before they buy with the help of augmented reality. All customers need to do is upload an image of themselves or use their computer’s camera to try on cosmetics or different hair color. A live before and after comparison is available through the apps' sliding feature.

Smart Hairbrush
Another product the incubator created through a partnership with smart technology maker Withings and Kérastase (L’Oréal’s luxury hair-care brand) is aimed at responding to those who want to reduce their bad-hair days. The brush uses a conductivity sensor, accelerometer, gyroscope, microphone and Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connections to gather technical insights, upload them to an algorithm that will be able to use the information to provide personalized product recommendations about the best way to care for the user’s hair.
Technology in L’Oréal’s Production Facilities
Along with sensors, cameras, and lasers, IBM's Watson IoT platform helps L’Oréal provide production facilities that are ready for the challenges and opportunities presented by Industry 4.0. Customers are demanding—they want the right formulations to address their specific concerns and accommodate personal preferences. Technology helps L’Oréal production facilities respond to these demands by being more responsive and agile.

Facebook Messenger Bot
As evidence of L’Oréal’s belief in conversational marketing, it partnered with Automat Technologies to launch a Facebook Messenger Bot to enable more personalized conversations with customers (that will ultimately drive sales). Artificial intelligence powers this bot, and by communicating with its customers in a conversational way, individuals will be more likely to open up about their personal preferences. Lubomira Rochet, the company’s chief digital officer, told Marketing Week that “I believe AI is as big a revolution as the internet itself.”

Streamline Recruiting and Hiring
Another way the cosmetics giant uses artificial intelligence is in recruiting and the hiring process. For about 15,000 openings a year, L’Oréal must process nearly a million applications and now uses AI in a variety of ways to free up their human employee’s time. So, Mya is a chatbot that saves significant time in the early stages of the recruiting process by handling questions from candidates and can check off important details such as availability and visa status. Then candidates encounter Seedlink, AI software that assesses their responses to open-ended interview questions. This tool has found candidates that might have been overlooked when just reviewing resumes. In one instance, the company’s recruiters believe they saved 200 hours of time to hire 80 interns out of a pool of 12,000 candidates.

AI-Powered Skin Diagnostic
After acquiring ModiFace, an AI/AR company that offers try-on simulations of beauty products with live video, L’Oréal had a new technology tool to offer customers—a skin diagnostic tool. Of the acquisition, Rochet said in a statement, “With the acquisition of ModiFace, we have started a second phase of L’Oréal’s digital transformation, focused on reinventing the beauty experience through technologies such as voice, AR and AI.”
Using deep learning, the tool uses ModiFace’s AR capabilities with L’Oréal's photo database, skin aging expertise, and Skin Aging Atlases to provide women with a personalized product routine after they upload a selfie to the company’s website. After launching in Canada as Vichy SkinConsultAI at the beginning of 2019, it should be available worldwide later in the year.
It’s expected that L’Oréal will continue to leverage artificial intelligence and technology to its competitive advantage and hopes to remain on the cutting-edge of product personalization and how best to use technology to enhance the beauty industry.

It’s much like the internet has emerged into everyone’s life as a game changer. Artificial intelligence and Data Science are ready to transform our unimaginable lives years ago.Let’s dig deeper into what they have to offer in near future.But before we jump into future, it’s ideal to understand these terms.So let’s get started.What is Data Science and Artificial Intelligence?A streamlined solution process for beings is Artificial Intelligence. It allows software to do duties without being programmed explicitly. Neural networks and profound learning are included. It is the larger notion that machines can execute duties as we consider them.And, the field of studying science that incorporates domain experience, programming abilities and mathematical and statistical knowledge to gain significant insights from data is defined as Data Science. In addition to other experimental types, data science needs observations, questions, assumptions, tests, results analysis and practical suggestions.Why are AI and Data Science Important?In view of the increasing amounts and variants of accessible information, the need for computer processing becomes essential to provide in-depth, inexpensive and readily accessible information. With the assistance of A.I. and Data Science, models that can analyze larger, more complicated information can be automatically automated to return more quick and precise outcomes.Data Science is important because company issues are resolved. When you–and the administration –recognize this, you are on the correct track. Too often companies want to learn the machines, big data projects without thinking about what they really do. If you want to succeed your information researchers, introduce the issues to them–let them develop the alternatives. Simply building a machine learning project will not want to be told. Knowing what the end goal is is crucial.AI is important because they are sufficiently effective to decrease human effort in different fields. Many of them use artificial intelligence to conduct multiple operations in the sector, creating machinery slaves that regularly conduct multiple operations. The application of artificial intelligence helps to make the job quicker and with precise outcomes. The primary reasons behind artificial intelligence are error-free and effective worlds. Even while creating today’s mobile applications, AI has a major role to play. Also many industries have begun using AI technology in recent years to decrease human effort and to achieve more effective and quicker outcomes.Who Is Using These Technologies?BankingThere is always a danger of fraudulence in the banking industry. Monitoring financial market and helps to detect and reduce abuses or malpractices. Data Science has been helping the banks to effectively focus on their resources, take smarter decisions and enhance efficiency. Whereas AI has been helping them overcome traditional obstacles to customer service by providing support lending and regulatory compliance choices.2. E-CommerceData Science helps E-commerce businesses gain a more complete understanding of customers through capturing and integrating web-behavior of customers and their life events, which led to the purchase of a product or service, following the interaction of customers with various channels and more. Whereas AI allows businesses to collect and research information in real time, thereby enabling greater effectiveness and company competence.3. FinanceArtificial intelligence leads to the next economic revolution, from client service to risk management. In finance, AI has automated procedures and decreased customer service costs dramatically. Although the price of financial services has been lowered by AI, on the one side, funding has become highly easy to use. Whereas finance is the data hub. Early consumers and pioneers of data science were used in financial institutions. In the area of developing innovative software development solutions for risk analysis, customer management, the detection of fraud and algorithm trading, data science is commonly used.4. Healthcare & FitnessMedicine and health is a revolutionary sector that offers promising alternatives to data science. Data analysis moves medical science to a whole new level, from computerisation to drug discovery and the exploration of genetic diseases. Healthcare and data science are often connected by finances, since the sector is using a big amount of information to decrease its costs. Whereas The transformative strength of artificial intelligence (IA) is repercussive throughout many sectors, but it has an effect on one — health care — that genuinely changes life. AI apps are revolutionizing how the health industry operates to decrease expenditure and enhance patient results, ranging from hospital care to clinical studies, drug development and insurance.5. InsuranceFrom fraud detection to increased client experience, specialists predict that any significant insurance choice in the next century could be backed by artificial intelligence. And, with the automation of tedious and labor-intensive company procedures, insurers will be able to boost sales and free up time to deal with clients using AI. Whereas Big Data analysis enables the insurers improve their price precision, build tailored goods and services, identify fraud, process for claims, create value for end clients and helps to improve company efficiency and profitability automatically.6. Transportation and ConveyanceWhen customers collect more connected equipment or devices, businesses concentrate on using the information produced by those devices to improve real-time consumer analysis with the help of Data Science. Whereas from independent cars to intelligent roads AI is becoming an important factor to consider in transportation.7. Sales and MarketingAI allows to scale growth for marketers by driving income, and customizing client experiences. Savvy marketers find that AI is an extremely strong approach. It empowers them to excel in their positions through personalized, focused messaging — all at scale — to engage with their audiences. Whereas using data science marketing professionals understand the needed to determine which marketing strategies are most efficient for particular customer.Future of Data SciencePredictions for a science that comprises so many distinct disciplines are very hard to create. This implies you must reflect on the present trends and outlook for each discipline. However, the previous and present state of data science should serve as a useful base for forecasting the future of data science. Data science is therefore mainly concentrated on descriptive analysis in both the past and the present. In other words, the future of Data Science depends on information collection and on what has occurred in the past.However, specialists expect more advanced analytics, including real-time and predictive analysis, to be developed in the future, thanks to fast advances in technology. The industries will once again have a major effect on the look and objectives of data science.Machine learning is also anticipated to change considerably as one of the fundamental components of data science. The data scientists will have to unleash their creativity and make use of distinct modes rather than put their main attention at this teaching mechanics. Although the data scientists have a high degree of efficiency, they will need to improve their efficiency if they want to stay competitive in future and change the way they practice in machine learning.As stated before, the futures and trends that we can expect are not easy to predict, but some researchers believe that there is little to be done in the future simply on the basis of our experience in future trends of data science so far.First of all, we will see fresh information sources emerge. The Internet of Things is not new, but the link between machines supported by this idea in the future will lead to links across electronic devices. Data scientists today use clickstream data, purchase data and sales data, but they will have to include data collected from distinct retail settings, manufacturing streams, offices, cars, staff, etc. in near future.Moreover, the tools used by today’s data scientists are very likely to become more advanced, making complicated tasks much simpler. In fact, we are already witnessing this with so-called BI tools as well as open-source libraries. Many of the algorithms had to be created from zero. There are ready-made codes today that can make this job easier. With the advancement of technology, even new analysts are anticipated to conduct cross-validation and machine learning alone.The increasing level of collaboration between data scientist and system engineers is another thing that will most probably occur in the near future. The first instance of such collaboration has proved very useful to the company’s general efficiency.Finally, two fundamental tasks is required to be focused by data scientist. The first is the preparation of input data using their domain and business understanding. Secondly, the results produced by the tools needs to be analysed and interpreted.Data science is not a fresh idea, but it is becoming more important now and will become much more important in the future according to many professionals.Future of Artificial IntelligenceScience-fiction has always fascinated man, trying to recreate some of the wildest technological imaginations. The fascination was born of robots, smart machines, sophisticated software, artificial intelligence and neural networks, which are now all a thing of the past. We have come a long way from a vision to real progress. The intriguing science and technology that is slowly molding the future of Artificial Intelligence.We think, however, that when artificial intelligence takes complete shape, the future will become more epic. We foresee the future of artificial understanding as nothing short of the best science fiction films. Here is the future of artificial intelligence to paint a better image in your mind.On self-driving cars we’ve heard, read, and seen enough. We have already experienced the first step towards automated transport with technological mammoths like Tesla, Google, Uber and others with self-driving cars. Although certain tests failed, it was successful to take the self-driving cars. We will see replicas on our highways from Back to Future, where cars such as government buses, cabins and even personal cars go driverless and autopilot. Smart cars can take the highways more precisely and pave the way for safer, quicker and more economical transport systems.Today, people are doing some of the most hazardous employment. We go down, get our hands dirty and risk our life, from the cleaning of the waste to fighting fire and disseminating bombs. The amount of life that we lose in these procedures is also very big. Machines or robots can be expected to look after in the near future. With more artificial intelligence evolving and intelligent robots rolling out, people can replace them on some of the world’s most risky employment. This is the only moment that we expect employment from automation.Some of us would have used virtual assistants already. However, we can expect the technology to become private helpers and emotional people as the technology develops. It is extremely feasible that we can emoticize robots and provide them with assistance with artificial intelligence, deep learning and neural networks. They can be used for tons of reasons, such as hospitality, day-care, elderly, clerical employment and many other things. Nowadays many businesses are looking to hire mobile app developers who have expertise in AI as they want to incorporate virtual assistants in their mobile apps.Data is presently one of the strongest stuff. As humans, the absence of knowledge of the present conditions and their implications is one reason we can do nothing about climate change. We also have limited knowledge about the impact of little change and actions on climate change in our day-to-day lives. This is not the situation with computers. With IoT evolving and towns becoming intelligent, we can considerably cut back on the harm that we cause daily with automated utilities, homes and more.Ending upAll these might sound far away, but you’d never believe if we said people have already started working intensively on artificial intelligence. We’re nowhere near seeing the first prototype of super intelligent robots. Machines can make the world a better place with their access to data and accuracy. Therefore, AI development company should do more research and strive hard to bring forward more cutting edge AI technologies to make our lives better and easier. What do you think? What do you believe? Mention your thoughts in the comment box below.Demand for IT experts and mobile app development company in Los Angeles and elsewhere in the world is always high, but it is difficult to discover a highly reliable and extensive on-line Data Science And Artificial Intelligence company in such a rapidly changing sector. Many companies want to deliver excellent services in these areas need to do adequate research in the core AI and data science technologies and hire expert developers only.For the next generation of programmers, engineers and developers, these companies should have intent to be the starting point and a resource for current professionals.",,,,,,,,,2019-09-09T11:53:04.029Z,5ef0ace4e80c,['Sophia Martin'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Right now they don’t.Sept. 6, 2019Credit...Claire MerchlinskyShare full articleRead in appBy Gary Marcus and Ernest DavisDr. Marcus is cognitive psychologist and robotics entrepreneur. Dr. Davis is a computer scientist.Artificial intelligence has a trust problem. We are relying on A.I. more and more, but it hasn’t yet earned our confidence.Tesla cars driving in Autopilot mode, for example, have a troubling history of crashing into stopped vehicles. Amazon’s facial recognition system works great much of the time, but when asked to compare the faces of all 535 members of Congress with 25,000 public arrest photos, it found 28 matches, when in reality there were none. A computer program designed to vet job applicants for Amazon was discovered to systematically discriminate against women. Every month new weaknesses in A.I. are uncovered.The problem is not that today’s A.I. needs to get better at what it does. The problem is that today’s A.I. needs to try to do something completely different.In particular, we need to stop building computer systems that merely get better and better at detecting statistical patterns in data sets — often using an approach known as deep learning — and start building computer systems that from the moment of their assembly innately grasp three basic concepts: time, space and causality.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTToday’s A.I. systems know surprisingly little about any of these concepts. Take the idea of time. We recently searched on Google for “Did George Washington own a computer?” — a query whose answer requires relating two basic facts (when Washington lived, when the computer was invented) in a single temporal framework. None of Google’s first 10 search results gave the correct answer. The results didn’t even really address the question. The highest-ranked link was to a news story in The Guardian about a computerized portrait of Martha Washington as she might have looked as a young woman.Sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter  Get expert analysis of the news and a guide to the big ideas shaping the world every weekday morning.  Get it sent to your inbox.Google’s Talk to Books, an A.I. venture that aims to answer your questions by providing relevant passages from a huge database of texts, did no better. It served up 20 passages with a wide array of facts, some about George Washington, others about the invention of computers, but with no meaningful connection between the two.The situation is even worse when it comes to A.I. and the concepts of space and causality. Even a young child, encountering a cheese grater for the first time, can figure out why it has holes with sharp edges, which parts allow cheese to drop through, which parts you grasp with your fingers and so on. But no existing A.I. can properly understand how the shape of an object is related to its function. Machines can identify what things are, but not how something’s physical features correspond to its potential causal effects.For certain A.I. tasks, the dominant data-correlation approach works fine. You can easily train a deep-learning machine to, say, identify pictures of Siamese cats and pictures of Derek Jeter, and to discriminate between the two. This is why such programs are good for automatic photo tagging. But they don’t have the conceptual depth to realize, for instance, that there are lots of different Siamese cats but only one Derek Jeter and that therefore a picture that shows two Siamese cats is unremarkable, whereas a picture that shows two Derek Jeters has been doctored.In no small part, this failure of comprehension is why general-purpose robots like the housekeeper Rosie in “The Jetsons” remain a fantasy. If Rosie can’t understand the basics of how the world works, we can’t trust her in our home.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTWithout the concepts of time, space and causality, much of common sense is impossible. We all know, for example, that any given animal’s life begins with its birth and ends with its death; that at every moment during its life it occupies some particular region in space; that two animals can’t ordinarily be in the same space at the same time; that two animals can be in the same space at different times; and so on.We don’t have to be taught this kind of knowledge explicitly. It is the set of background assumptions, the conceptual framework, that makes possible all our other thinking about the world.Yet few people working in A.I. are even trying to build such background assumptions into their machines. We’re not saying that doing so is easy — on the contrary, it’s a significant theoretical and practical challenge — but we’re not going to get sophisticated computer intelligence without it.If we build machines equipped with rich conceptual understanding, some other worries will go away. The philosopher Nick Bostrom, for example, has imagined a scenario in which a powerful A.I. machine instructed to make paper clips doesn’t know when to stop and eventually turns the whole world — people included — into paper clips.In our view, this kind of dystopian speculation arises in large part from thinking about today’s mindless A.I. systems and extrapolating from them. If all you can calculate is statistical correlation, you can’t conceptualize harm. But A.I. systems that know about time, space and causality are the kinds of things that can be programmed to follow more general instructions, such as “A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm” (the first of Isaac Asimov’s three laws of robotics).We face a choice. We can stick with today’s approach to A.I. and greatly restrict what the machines are allowed to do (lest we end up with autonomous-vehicle crashes and machines that perpetuate bias rather than reduce it). Or we can shift our approach to A.I. in the hope of developing machines that have a rich enough conceptual understanding of the world that we need not fear their operation. Anything else would be too risky.Gary Marcus (@GaryMarcus), the founder and chief executive of Robust AI, and Ernest Davis, a professor of computer science at New York University, are the authors of the forthcoming book “Rebooting AI: Building Artificial Intelligence We Can Trust,” from which this essay is adapted.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

WASHINGTON, D.C.-Today, U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry announced the establishment of the DOE Artificial Intelligence and Technology Office (AITO). The Secretary has established the office to serve as the coordinating hub for the work being done across the DOE enterprise in Artificial Intelligence. This action has been taken as part of the President’s call for a national AI strategy to ensure AI technologies are developed to positively impact the lives of Americans.DOE-fueled AI is already being used to strengthen our national security and cybersecurity, improve grid resilience, increase environmental sustainability, enable smarter cities, improve water resource management, as well as speed the discovery of new materials and compounds, and further the understanding, prediction, and treatment of disease. DOE’s National Labs are home to four of the top ten fastest supercomputers in the world, and we’re currently building three next-generation, exascale machines, which will be even faster and more AI-capable computers.     













“The world is in the midst of the Golden Age of AI, and DOE’s world class scientific and computing capabilities will be critical to securing America’s dominance in this field,” said Secretary Perry.  “This new office housed within the Department of Energy will concentrate our existing efforts while also facilitating partnerships and access to federal data, models and high performance computing resources for America’s AI researchers.

Although we don't see the motivation or reasoning behind the algorithms we spend so much time with, they are doing great things for us, and so we love them. Unfortunately, we don't necessarily understand them or how they will change us. By we, I don't just mean the general public. I mean software developers, their managers, and even machine learning engineers. AI does some things well and some things poorly, but on balance, the benefits exceed the costs of having an algorithm making decisions.

Just like any relationship, it’s about accepting your partner’s flaws just as much as their charms, and understanding how both can shape your future together. Thought leaders are having a pretty public debate about where this technology is going, and where the relationship may sour. In one specific recent example, Jack Ma and Elon Musk recently discussed the future of humanity in a world run on artificial intelligence. The general viewpoint from Ma was upbeat, while Musk urged caution. These two points of view both have merit. AI is delivering a lot of value, and could also cause a lot of problems. On the positive side, automation with AI is already changing the way we work and play. However, on the cautionary side, imperfect AI systems will not only annoy us, they could bring s to question the technology itself. Simplifying artificial intelligence as Musk and Ma have, casting “AI = good” vs “AI = bad” misses the point that “AI = now”. AI is already here and it will keep getting better. Just so you understand, regular non-AI software does what you tell it to do, whereas AI looks at a set of data to figure out what to do based on the data.

Beyond Deep Learning: Computers That Improvise | The Great Rewrite

AI algorithms have their flaws but so do things we like, such as driving, and we still accept them. As we embrace the bots (AI algorithms), we shouldn’t hide from the flaws in how things work today. Driving cars causes car crashes, but we love driving. It’s worth the risk. There are many problems in the AI field that need work, including the interpretability of AI models, better tools for dataset handling, more automated machine learning, and avoiding bias. And yet the benefits massively outweigh the risks. We use artificial intelligence in many aspects of our lives, from spam filters to movie recommendations. 

PROMOTED
What are the signs the evolution of artificial intelligence will follow a positive path of widely adopted technology, rather than concentrating within a few large companies? The artificial intelligence community is making a concerted effort to supply tools and education to regular software developers so that more and more business processes can integrate artificial intelligence. For example, there is probably code on GitHub for achieving common artificial intelligence tasks, licensed for free commercial use. I’m not suggesting that these models are production ready, but it’s good to have this development out in the open. The major cloud providers such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and IBM have made machine learning resources easy to access, and they also support integration partner networks for custom AI development. This is a really good situation, but there is room for improvement. 

AI is a complicated set of technologies, and the way these technologies are used to build products is still evolving. It is well known in the AI industry that there are flaws in the way machine learning models are shared between researchers and eventually used to deliver projects in industry. Specifically, AI models can be fooled with carefully designed adversarial examples (the model sees something when it should see nothing or vice versa), backdoors (the model does the main task but also some other hidden task), and privacy leaks (the model can be reversed to reveal the private training data, or simply bypasses encryption). These problems can apply to everything from self-driving cars to doorbells.

I feel that today the world is using many artificial intelligence capabilities by following a strategy known in the software security world as ""security through obscurity"". It is a bad idea to assume that tinkerers won't eventually figure out how to ""hack"" flawed machine learning models, especially those that they can buy and take apart. And so it makes sense to assume that academics, hackers, and regular Joe will try breaking into places that developers did not want them to go, including analyzing AI models with randomly generated data to see what happens. Trying random data is called fuzzing, and in computer hardware, it has revealed a series of CPU instructions that were not meant to be in the public domain. Similar hacks are going to spring up against AI systems, and like regular software, I predict that AI bugs and data breaches are going to be in the news.

Reverse engineering a doorbell does not seem problematic, but reverse engineering stock trading algorithms would be bad. Simply knowing that someone else uses a particular AI model gives you an advantage in how you operate. Even knowing that a certain signal triggers most AI models to make a mistake is an opening to do naughty things.

[+] cuts a Margherita Pizza for a customer on June 26, 2019. (Photo by Nathan Klima for The Boston Globe via Getty Images)Boston Globe via Getty Images
For example, Alice and Bob are sitting in Eve's pizza shop. Bob uses a free and widely available AI model called ""wants pizza"", to predict that Alice is hungry and wants to buy the last slice of pizza for $1 in 2 minutes. Bob also has a crush on Alice and so he doesn't want to buy the last slice of pizza. Bob is faced with a hunger for pizza, and a fear of rejection, and so he pulls out some cash and is ready to pay $10 for a new pie of Eve's pizza. Eve knows all about the poor quality ""wants pizza"" AI model that Bob is using, and she has studied it well. Eve has a copy of the ""wants pizza"" AI model, and so she knows what it predicted for Bob. Eve also has a better AI model and predicts that Alice will instead get up to use the bathroom, costing Eve $9 in lost revenue when Bob decides to simply buy the last slice for himself. Eve now has an excellent picture of what Alice and Bob think and can take advantage of the pizza market by quickly taking Bob's $10 pizza order before Alice gets up to ask for the key to the restroom. Obviously, this example of information asymmetry applies to more than the pizza market. Trading outfits can take advantage of dark pools to mask their intentions from an order book, and there are many other strategies to avoid telegraphing in advance what orders will be placed. However, regardless of the cat and mouse games to try and hide information from other parties, the main idea I'm trying to convey with this story about Alice, Bob, and Eve is that our software ecosystem today is good at detecting bugs in regular software, when we care about it, but not as good at detecting machine learning bugs, or even knowing about them. Our complicated relationship with models that make predictions will be an important issue even in the very short term. This is an area for improvement.
The general rule in artificial intelligence is that data is power, especially proprietary data. However, keep in mind that AI models are trained on data, and common practice of using pre-trained models means that, even if the source data is not disclosed, the behavior of a disclosed model could be extracted and turned inside out. The most vulnerable AI models are the pre-trained off-the-shelf kind that is widely used but not necessarily widely audited.
Identifying unintentional flaws (bugs) is how Eve keeps one step ahead in the pizza game. There are many ways that these bugs can find their way into AI models. For example, squishing a model down to a smaller size so that it fits onto a phone can cause errors (quantization error), but careful testing can avoid this sort of problem. As with regular software, artificial intelligence can be designed to be really robust, but it takes extra effort that most developers and companies will not invest. 
When you tell an AI-based assistant to set a meeting and it uses the wrong timezone, the two common reactions are “the software is broken” or “I used the software wrong”. Interacting with a human personal assistant, you develop a relationship and develop expectations for how certain tasks will be carried out. As we increasingly rely on AI-based assistants, how do our expectations, and our sense of self, begin to change?
And so it seems that problems abound. Why don't software developers at companies simply fix the problems? Well, many of these problems are not solved yet, and often the issues with machine learning models are introduced by a programmer who has never spoken with the person who wrote the code for the task they are running, who also never met the person who collected the raw data, and so on. As soon as you unwrap the gift basket of machine learning, you will find that complicated math is running under the hood. AI developers need to check that their assumptions are consistent with the mathematics of the software library developers. 
Artificial intelligence, as imperfect as it is, has huge potential to continue to improve our lives, and with any disruptive technology, there will be issues. I want to give you a realistic view of where artificial intelligence has been adding serious economic productivity gains, and where it's just not ready for primetime. I don't want to set off the alarm bells that everything is terrible. It isn't. But in this same vein, we need to acknowledge that as a society we are always playing with stuff while it is still being invented, and eating raw cookie dough because we don't want to wait for the cookies to bake. 
Given that there are these open problems in artificial intelligence that people are working on right now, I foresee artificial intelligence adoption following a similar model to WiFi technology. We upgraded the technology for WiFi several times since the 1990s - remember WEP, WPA, and WPA2 - and even though it was annoying, we all just rolled with the punches because WiFi did (and continues to do) great things for us. 
Moving forward, let's assume these problems get ironed out over time. As artificial intelligence grows up and integrates ever more deeply into our everyday lives, how will AI affect the modern workforce? Let's take a look in the rearview mirror to think about what the past can tell us about where artificial intelligence may take us, and where it really will take a wrecking ball to jobs held by humans today.
Anxiety is a strong motivator, and office workers I talk with feel that automation is coming for their jobs. They don't realize that all the problems mentioned in the first half of this article are limiting the broad adoption of AI. Until that last traffic light comes down in America, we can't have autonomous cars whizzing through intersections without stopping, unlocking the greater efficiency you see when a crowd of humans walks past each other in a courtyard. It's that locked in legacy process of having a system in place that makes radical change slow and costly. And so I'm not worried about, for example, all programmers losing their jobs to AI, as we have been trying to put ourselves out of a job for many years with automated tools, and the sector just keeps growing. But what about office workers, accountants, marketers, and all the rest of the citizens of the cubicle maze? 
The talent economy, in my view, is still strong on the supply and demand sides of the global high-tech economy. There are reasons to be optimistic about the near future. There is a talent shortage among artificial intelligence developers, and even among the broader economy employment is historically quite good, even with underemployment factored in.
So, if the optimistic Jack Ma picture is right in the short term, when will the ""artificial intelligence is good"" party be over? Should humans be looking down in fear at their computerized replacements? I don't think so. The warnings from Musk should encourage us as a society to have a lively debate, not to hide under our desks in the fetal position.SHANGHAI, CHINA - AUGUST 29: Alibaba Group Chairman Jack Ma (L) and Tesla Co-founder/CEO Elon Musk ...

There is a secular trend toward the adoption of AI. It is in a growth mode, driven in part by technology and in part by the general economy. The growth rate of adoption may be fast or slow, but it won’t be negative. Although AI, a term coined in 1956, was based on research in the 1930s and 1940s on neural networks, the majority of techniques in practical applications of AI are still quite new. The end of the last artificial intelligence winter coincided with the beginning of the longest period of stable economic growth in US history. Therefore, the resurgent field of AI has not been battle-tested by a recession as older fields have, such as the dotcom bubble and real-estate crises. Furthermore, the artificial intelligence field, like many emerging technologies in their time, has been plagued by hype, overpromise, and misinformation. Problems with AI are still easy to point out. Problems like AI interpretability, dataset handling tools, automated machine learning, bias, adversarial examples, backdoors, privacy leaks, legacy systems, and so many other factors are holding back AI adoption like a wall of inertia. And so I don't see AI racing to empty office buildings of their human workers. Does that mean the AI field is cooling off? In the short term, I don't see a new AI winter as likely. Recession is a scary word, and the average person still has a visceral reaction to the pain of the 2008 recession and the economic reset that followed. But no two recessions are alike. A recession in the overall economy does not necessarily mean a recession in the artificial intelligence field or even in the high-tech field. 
Even if several signs point to an impending recession (e.g. yield curve inversion), it is important to view corrections in the economy as a controlled burn to keep the core economy healthy, rather than an uncontrolled burn to level the economic neighborhood. In a recession, which hopefully doesn't materialize, people and corporations look for efficiency, and artificial intelligence is all about efficiency. Have a look at a long term chart for a broad index like the Russell 3000 (represents about 98% of all public US equity), which moved from around 200 in the early 1990s to the 1700 level in 2019. Even adjusted for inflation, that's really broad-based growth. The story behind this rise in the US economy has a lot more to do with automation in general than it has to do with something specific like artificial intelligence. Spreadsheets changed the way business is conducted by humans in offices, and that story started way before artificial intelligence shot to prominence over the past decade. I do feel that artificial intelligence is moving into the driver's seat of the automation school bus. Literally. If you drive a truck, automation is coming after your job, plain and simple. It's not paranoia if they really are out to get you.

Other jobs in the economy will not be automated in my lifetime, simply because we don't want robots watching our babies or cutting our hair. And AI, in my view, is more likely to improve human productivity like the spreadsheet did for office workers, rather than replace the humans with complete automation.
And so I take a middle of the road view on how seriously to take the problems with AI and how the technology is being adopted. There are plenty of technical challenges to address right in the here and now. We have not solved cancer yet. We don't have fusion reactors yet. There is a lot of work to do as we humans finish inventing artificial intelligence as a field, and the hope - my hope - is that progress in artificial intelligence will propel us forward in many key areas where humanity could really use a helping hand.
Key Points:


Is AI good or bad? On the whole, artificial intelligence can be a force for good, although it still needs work, because we already have such a complicated relationship with our tech
Is the AI field cooling off? Progress probably won't slow down
Is AI a huge job killer? No more than the humble spreadsheet was. In the same way that spreadsheets provided a jolt of productivity to a wide range of jobs, today's artificial intelligence advances will have a broad impact on many job categories, but will only apply deep damage to a few select areas where humans can be fully replaced, like driving
Should you be integrating AI into your plans and processes? Yes

But today, the 29-year-old does data labelling and makes up to Rs 15,000 a month. The money isn't much but it's more than she made as a teacher, and enough to pay her kids' school fees and her own expenses.She chanced on data labelling work through a You-Tube video in 2017. Today, she scans videos and marks and labels objects encountered by self-driving cars. Her output is used to train artificial intelligence algorithms powering such cars. All Mathi knows is that it makes her life easier. ""I can work from home and don't have to choose between work and family,"" she says. 71049251 Experts say there are about a lakh data labelling jobs posted on various portals currently (Pic: Indranil Das)Mathi is one of the faceless workers helping companies in the US and Europe perfect their machine learning models. For instance, if you're trying to get a driverless car to correctly identify a stop sign, you need to feed that algorithm thousands of images correctly labelled as stop signs. Sharmila Gupta of Gurgaon-based AI Touch likens data labelling to training a newborn. ""Any AI model requires labelled data to get trained. This is like teaching a small child multiple times till they understand."" It's a job that only humans can do and since it is quite labour intensive, it is being outsourced to countries with cheap labour like India, Malaysia, the Philippines and Kenya. 71046795 There is a new AI workforce, says Ajay Shah of HR company TeamLease Services. From an opportunity point of view, there are about a lakh jobs posted on various portals currently.Mary Gray, a researcher and author of the book 'Ghost Work: How to Stop Silicon Valley from Building a New Global Underclass', says there are two main reasons why companies are turning to India for data-labelling and annotation. ""It has a workforce trained in English as a first language and an internet infrastructure created during the first outsourcing boom that relied heavily on India as an offshore labour market,"" says Gray. There is also a growing demand for data-labelling services that are ""localised""- both linguistically and culturally relevant to India - and this work can't be done by workers in the United States. 71046495 Data labelling workers in KolkataPlayment, a crowd-sourced marketplace that trains annotators from scratch, where Hyderabad's Mathi works, has 25,000 annotators between the age of 18 and 30 years working remotely across India, and its co-founder Siddharth Mall claims that anyone with a laptop and basic English skills can start working. ""Everybody talks about how AI will make people lose their jobs, but there are also new kinds of jobs being created,"" he says. These youngsters earn anywhere between Rs 20,000 and Rs 30,000 a month.It's not a fortune but it's helping many annotators - most of them stay-at-home moms, fresh graduates and even students, such as 21-year-old Shiekha Mahara from Nalgonda, Telangana - get by. Mahara, who recently completed a BTech degree, began looking for online work opportunities to help out with her family's finances. She has earned Rs 1.3 lakh so far while doing occasional projects for Playment over the last year and a half. 71046796 Unlike Playment which pays people on a contractual basis, iMerit, a data annotation company with offices in India and the US and data labelling centres in Ranchi, Shillong, Vizag and Kolkata, has 2,500 people on their rolls. What they have in common is an overwhelmingly young workforce. At iMerit, the average age of employees is just 24. Jai Natarajan, VP, marketing and strategic business development, says that nearly 80% of their employees come from underprivileged backgrounds, while 50% are women. ""Our employees are positioned for the future because they understand that they have to learn new things, that nothing stays still,"" says Natarajan. iMerit's employees do data labelling for drones in the agriculture sector, medical imagery such as MRI scans, e-commerce, and sports analytics.Mujeeb Kolasseri, a high school dropout from Mannarkkad in Kerala, founded his own data labelling company Infolks in 2015 after learning the work online. Today, the company employs nearly 250 people, nearly half of them from poor families in Kolasseri's village. New employees get trained on image annotation tools for two months. ""Nearly 80% are freshers. With proper training, anyone can work on image annotation without any technical knowledge - you just need to be a quick learner,"" says Kolasseri, who was forced to quit his studies because of his family's financial problems. 71046535 Data labelling workers in KeralaJitendra Kumar, 27, would agree. Six months ago, Kumar, who used to drive a four-wheeler for weddings and parties in his hometown Etawah, Uttar Pradesh, found a data labelling job with Gurgaon-based firm AI Touch. ""Now, I get a salary on time, work in an office and can spend some time with my family as well,"" says Kumar.Kumar's colleague Satyam Barthwal, a Chinese interpreter, was hired after the company got work from a Chinese AI company. ""I hadn't even heard of data labelling before I got the call,"" says Barthwal, who sees the job as a way to earn money till he fulfils his dream of becoming a singer. ""The work is easy - we just need to read labels.""But as machine learning evolves, will it make the work of data labelling redundant in the future?

From daily lives to corporate cultures, everything is being impacted by the novel technology. Artificial Intelligence (AI) strategically improves business processes by giving managers the power to analyze a vast amount of valuable data derived from customers as well as employees.When it comes to human resources, AI is particularly solving one of the greatest issues managers have been facing for many years- to improve employee engagement and retention rates.Trending AI Articles:1.

Visual Music & Machine Learning Workshop for KidsThe Looming Engagement Crisis across IndustriesAI has the potential to give managers the power to make a better workplace, where employees don’t feel distracted or dissatisfied with their job roles.Source: https://www.thepeoplespace.com/practice/articles/were-more-machine-now-man-hr-and-digital-journeyAt present, organizations are increasingly moving towards AI technology to enhance employee engagement within the workplaces. From onboarding to collaboration, training to information sharing, AI is changing the way human resource department functions to keep employees satisfied.And in a way, AI is helping organizations deal with several critical crises through innovative use cases and applications.Impact of AI on Boosting EngagementCorporate organizations have been dealing with the problem of dissatisfaction and non-engaged workers for a long time. Often, corporate appraisal and feedback process are long, asking managers for feedback on employee’s performance, annually.In a dynamic work environment where every employee is seeking purpose and growth opportunities, such obsolete practices lead to a feeling of discontent among the workforce. Non-satisfied work is often not engaged and committed to their jobs, like they should, leading to a dip in productivity and efficiency.Artificial Intelligence can be used to identify instances of dissatisfaction among the workforce through a unique sentiment analysis solution. With the help of artificial intelligence, organizations can understand how an employee is feeling about developments within the office- the way his/her boss behaves, the work environment, relationship with his/her colleagues and lot more.Artificial Intelligence-powered sentiment analysis can analyze vast amounts of unstructured employee data to derive meaningful insights about overall employee engagement.Sentiment Analysis in Modern Corporate EnvironmentSentiment analysis is a unique concept that derives useful insights about employee’s mindset and thoughts by analyzing how he/she is communicating within the office environment. By keeping a close eye on his/her language, tone, and interests in communication via email and other channels, sentiment analysis can understand if he/she is happy or dissatisfied with what he is doing in a company.Language is how a person expresses his/her thoughts to others. Using sentiment analysis, companies can mine the underlying data in every sentence, interaction and correspondence for own benefit.Sentiment analysis allows companies to analyze large amounts of textual data and categorize the same based on the sentiment or attitude in which it has been created. By using the structured data, organizations can gauge the mood of the employees within a department, office or location and create meaningful solutions that boost employee engagement.Discover how AI can boost employee engagement through sentiment analysisHow Sentiment Analysis works?Sentiment Analysis blends natural language processing with machine learning and AI to offer meaningful insights from how an employee is responding to conversations. Making use of machine learning algorithms, a system is train to identify words that might be negative or problematic.Vast amount of data is then analyzed to see if employees are concerned about a specific aspect of their work environment or job. Using a mix of survey responses and emails, sentiment analysis discovers areas that might need intervention by a human HR manager.Real-world Applications of AI-powered Sentiment Analysis ModelsSentiment analysis has a variety of applications and implications in the modern corporate environment. In fact, there are more than a few ways to employ sentiment analysis techniques to gauge how employees feel about their jobs and workplace. Here are a few real-life use cases to leverage the power of sentiment analysis for building a better workplace:Using sentiment analysis for analyzing emailsThis is one of the most common ways of implementing sentiment analysis within office cultures. Sentiment analysis tools can be programmed to determine how engaged employees remain throughout the day. By identifying exact words and phrases, email-based sentiment analysis tool can help infer insights based on departmental level or individual level. Such insightful data can then be used to address specific issues or introduce organization-wide changes to improve the culture.Gauging Intent from Comments on Public PlatformsA great way to utilize sentiment analysis technology is to take insights from the feedback and comments posted by employees on the company’s public platforms, inter* net or performance review platforms. The data related to social commentary can be analyzed by machine learning tools to understand the basic sentiment and mood of the employees.Sentiment analysis can categorize comments by identifying negative issues or positive ones to create a general idea about how engaged and satisfied employees are on the job.Analyzing Employee FeedbackIt is a common practice among companies to gather employee feedback on various aspects like work culture, office environment, colleague relationships and what they feel while working. This system of listening to the employees is often not backed by meaningful decision making as companies lack the technologies to analyze the vast amount of unstructured data.With the help of sentiment analysis tools, companies can actually derive useful insights from the survey data and feedback received by the employees. The text analysis platforms powered by natural language processing, machine learning and artificial intelligence gives useful information about the employee sentiment and engagement.What Difference does Artificial Intelligence Make in Corporate Organizations?Artificial intelligence-powered sentiment analysis tools can serve as a potent solution to the problem of deteriorating employee engagement metrics. Here are a few ways how sentiment analysis powered by AI is helping corporate organizations improve employee engagementIdentifying Smart TrendsSentiment analysis algorithms analyze vast amounts of employee survey data and qualitative feedback to offer actionable insights on how to engage employees. Not only this provides a holistic picture of engagement levels, it helps the management in evaluating and rolling out changes based on the employee aspirations.Such deep analytics capabilities help organizations understand large scale trends that can enable organizations to make concrete changes to the overall employee engagement, learning and development and other HR policies.Employee EmpowermentSentiment analysis can empower employees like never before. When an organization takes advantage of artificial intelligence to listen and understand how employees feel about everything inside the office, it leads to the development of positive work culture. Management teams and HR desks make an effort to change the things that create dissatisfaction, which in turn make employees feel that their opinion, however subtle, is heard, appreciated and worked upon. This gives employees more confidence to speak out and be a part of the change, giving them a sense of empowerment.The data-based analytics powered by sentiment analysis is paving way for a better work environment where employees can make a real difference by voicing their opinions, which in turn gets heard by the management team.Wrapping UpArtificial Intelligence is a truly revolutionizing force that can change the way everyone works. While for the organizations, this means a better understanding of their workforce, for the employees it means higher satisfaction levels and a feeling of fulfillment. Just like a mutually dependent relationship, this synergy created by sentiment analysis is beneficial for all the stakeholders, employees, management as well as the end clients- as satisfied employees lead to better services.If you are eager to explore the advantages of sentiment analysis tools for your organization, you should get in touch with an artificial intelligence development company, today. A professional AI development company can help you deploy sentiment analysis tools that will help you analyze data and derive meaningful insights for higher engagement.Don’t forget to give us your 👏 !",,,,,,,,,2019-09-06T13:13:40.821Z,3aa7d2e0dd4b,['Namee Jani'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The new system is composed of three components:1. Domain logic service —”artificial intelligence”2. Storage & retrieval service3. Backing data-store (Redis)Domain logic service processes input data and produces a 1024-dimensional normalized vector that represents the data. Which is then passed onto the Storage & retrieval service to be persisted.At retrieval time, Domain logic service produces another vector from the input that is transformed using same processing logic and Storage & retrieval service is tasked with producing a set of vectors that are already persisted in the system that are most similar to the given input.The reason the system is decomposed this way is because storage and retrieval is a challenging problem in itself. To isolate the problem, I placed it in a self-contained service. And following text is intended to explain why.Vector SimilarityBecause we work with vectors, let’s define “similarity” of two vectors as follows: Vector a is similar to input vector b if a) a is identical to b or b) distance between vectors a and b is smaller than distance between vector b and any other vector in the dataset and this distance is lower than given threshold.There are different methods for calculating distance between vectors:1. Euclidean distance2. Cosine distance3. CartesianVisual representation of euclidean distance (d) and cosine similarity (θ)This is a visual representation of euclidean distance (d) and cosine similarity (θ). While cosine looks at the angle between vectors (thus not taking into regard their weight or magnitude), euclidean distance is similar to using a ruler to actually measure the distance.Cosine similarity is generally used as a metric for measuring distance when the magnitude of the vectors does not matter. Which is exactly what we are going to use here. Our vectors come to Storage & retrieval service normalized (all vectors are unit vectors with length 1).Now that we established what it means to find “similar” vectors, let’s look at the real challenge — retrieving the set of similar vectors.The ChallengeA brute force approach for finding similar vectors would be to take the input and calculate cosine similarity to every other vector in the data set. Comparing vector to “all other vectors” does not scale well (it’s linear — O(n)) and considering the dimensionality of the vectors, you can see this becomes very ineffective when the data set grows. Not very practical if you need a realtime system that will process high number of these queries per second…Locality-Sensitive HashingInstead, we are going to use Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH).In computer science, LSH is an algorithmic technique that hashes similar input items into same “buckets” with high probability (the number of buckets are much smaller than the universe of possible input items).LSH primarily differs from conventional hashing (aka cryptographic) in the sense that cryptographic hashing tries to avoid collisions but LSH aims to maximize collisions for similar inputs.With LSH, vectors that are close to each other (“similar”) have same hash value, and vectors that are far apart have different hash value (“dis-similar”).This offers a potential solution to us— if we hash our vectors using LSH, we can reduce the number of vector comparisons required for a match retrieval.We can limit our search to a bucket (or set of buckets) to dramatically reduce the number of vectors for which we calculate cosine distance. But number of vectors to search can still be significant even within a bucket, if we consider datasets with millions of vectors. More on that later.However, this comes at a cost. The keyword you should focus on in the previous LSH definition is “probability”. LSH is not an exact algorithm, it uses approximation. There is no guarantee that similar vectors in the dataset will end up in the same bucket. It depends on the parameters that we provide to our algorithm how “probable” it will be for similar vectors to have the same hash.An important thing to note here is that for my use case, similarity cut off (threshold) is the cosine distance of 0.36, which is very wide and that makes the use of LSH more difficult because you need to consider much wider set of vectors. And LSH works best on vectors that are very close together.Luckily, we have one advantage working in our favor. We don’t need the single most similar vector. We can approximate. We can terminate the search within a bucket as soon as we find the first vector with distance smaller than our threshold. Let’s take an example of facial recognition. There, each vector in the system represents a face. But every person has multiple faces (multiple photos of his or her face) associated. And let’s say we are searching for a person using another face as an input. We don’t need to retrieve the single closest vector — the most similar face. We just need a face that is “close” enough (below specified threshold). By definition, that threshold should guarantee that every such vector below the threshold represents same person.While gathering notes for this article, I decided to put my current implementation to a test to understand performance of my system, and to see if I can improve upon it. And boy, did I learn a lot of things!BaselineBecause my objective was to observe (and hopefully improve) my current implementation, I first had to establish a way to measure the system under observation and then establish a baseline upon which we are trying to improve.I am lucky because I have been developing and testing my system for a while now, and I have “real-world” data from test users to play with.To setup my experiments, I hand picked a dataset of ~250 vectors to seed my system and nearly 3000 vectors to be used for similarity retrieval (i.e. “is any of the 250 seeded vectors similar to each one of the 3000 test vectors?”). This is not a huge dataset if you were to talk about production scale, but remember that we want to use this to observe accuracy of our algorithms, not hardware performance. And for that purpose it should be sufficient. Also worth noting, this dataset mustn’t be confused with dataset for training the artificial intelligence sub-system. That is already pre-trained on millions of data points and it’s out of scope of what we are discussing here today.To establish accuracy baseline, I used simple “brute-force” approach. That way, I am always guaranteed the most accurate result, at the cost of comparing my input with every single vector in the “database”. That’s the dreaded O(n) linear performance.Total number of “matches” was 673, with following similarity distribution:Similarity distribution histogram for baseline scenario (no approximation)To state the obvious, probability of finding the “right” match in this case is always 1. That is, if a similar vector exists, it will be retrieved. Looking at the probability graph for different algorithms will be the key to understanding their accuracy.Probability of retrieving correct match in brute-force approachApproximationNext, I decided to measure my currently implemented algorithm. Enter the world of problem approximation with LSH. Ideally, what we would like to see with LSH is reduced complexity (better than linear) of our search but keep accuracy at — or close to- 100%. To achieve this holy grail we would need to come up with a step function that hashes all vectors below threshold to same bucket and all other vectors to a different bucket. If we then search vectors within that particular bucket, we greatly reduce the search space and yet we are guaranteed to find similar vectors (provided they exist in our data set).Ideal case — step functionFirst we need calculate binary hash from our input vector. To do that, we partition the space by n random planes. For each plane, vector ends up in one of the two regions which the plane separates. We assign value of 1 if vector is on the positive side, or 0 if vector is on the negative side. Intuitively, the closest two documents are, the more likely they will be on the same region for a random plane. For example, if two documents are almost on top of each other, then they will end up on the same region for most of the planes that you can come up with.For planes drawn at random, it can be mathematically proven that two documents x and y hash to the same value with probability:The expression encapsulates our intuition: The closer two documents are (small θ) the greater the chances they end up in the same region.If we use just one plane to split our space in half, probability of two vectors having the same hash would be:Probability of two vectors having same single-bit binary hashYou can interpret this as probability of two vectors with cosine similarity 0.36 (threshold) to be hashed into same bucket to be roughly 0.72 (72%). Which may sound ok at first, but it also means that in 0.38 (38%) of cases, similar vectors will hash to different buckets (and thus we won’t find our match). And we only reduced our search space by 50%. That is not a good optimization, considering we are loosing a fair bit of accuracy.Let’s add more more random planes to end up with a hash which will look something like this:01110011(8-bit hash constructed by dividing space by 8 random hyperplanes)Now our probability decreases. It becomes very unlikely for vectors to hash into the same bucket unless they are nearly identical. Which, if you recall, is exactly what we established early on about LSH — the algorithm works best for very close matches (very small cosine distance between vectors).Probability of two vectors having same 8bit binary hashBut there are different techniques we can employ to improve our situation.Explore nearby bucketsConsider partial hash matchesNearby bucketsTo explore nearby buckets, I added Hamming distance hash variations.The idea is simple: once we obtain LSH hash, we calculate variations of that hash up to n distance. This allows for error correction for vectors that are similar according to our criteria, but end up in different buckets.If we take the hash from previous example, variations with Hamming distance 1 would be:1111001100110011010100110110001101111011011101110111000101110010For Hamming distance 2, we get:101100111101001111100011111110111111011111110001111100100001001100110011001110110011011100110001001100100100001101011011010101110101000101010010etc.In my case I chose a Hamming distance of 3, which produces total of 1+8+ 7*8/2 + 6*7/2 + 5*6/2 + 4*5/2 + 3*4/2 + 2*3/2 + 1*2/2 =93 variations. This gives us following probability of finding the correct match:8bit hash with Hamming distance 3Which is much better than the previous case, and shape of the curve starts to resemble the ideal step function. But it’s a clear tradeoffs between accuracy (approximation) and performance (time/resources it takes to get the result).This configuration gives satisfactory 93% accuracy compared to the baseline, and the sub-linear complexity provides average 63.7% reduction in the search space. Let me explain: in a hypothetical scenario with 1 million uniformly distributed vectors in our database, we keep ~3906 vectors in each one of the 256 buckets (8 bit hash = 256 different buckets). We need to search 93 buckets per query, which gives us ~363281 vectors to search (36.3% of 1 million stored vectors). But I could not stress enough that these calculations are average results in idealized scenario (uniformly distributed vectors), in reality, vectors will be more clustered in some buckets producing widely different results for different queries.That is a modest improvement, but it also cost us 7% of accuracy. In other words, in 7% of cases, there was a similar vector in the database but we did not find it.For completeness sake, let me explain how the actual data persistence is implemented. I use Redis and every hash simply translates to a key in the data store. Value is a Redis list of vectors to be searched along with metadata (for example, in music recommendation service that could be name of a song, an artist, …) that is returned in the query response.Partial hash matchesAs a last experiment, I tried a slightly different algorithm that I found while doing my research on LSH.For this experiment, we generate longer hash, but split it in multiple groups and search every bucket where at least one hash group matches a group in our query.input: 01110011 11001001 11001100(24 bit hash split in 3 groups)And if we have two different vectors stored in the system, hashed asa: 00110010 11001001 10001100b: 11000011 11001001 11001000Our input vector will be considered similar to vector b because the second group (11001001) matches the second group of the input.It was not until later - when I started analyzing my results - that I realized mistake I made only using 24bit hash split in 3 groups. This third experiment had no chance of outperforming my current implementation. The reason was staring me right in the face:24bit hash split in 3 groupsOnce I calculated the probability graph, I understood why I only saw 71% accuracy compared to the baseline. The probability of hashing two vectors with cosine distance of 0.36 falls down to ~22%. While the performance was better — in our idealized scenario with 1 million vectors, using this algorithm we only need to compare (on average)~12k vectors, a.k.a we reduce the search space by 98.8%.Because we split the hash to groups and we need to consider each group separately, we need a different mechanism to query Redis backend.For a sample hash 01110011 11001001 11001100, we break it down to 3 Redis keys:01110011xxx11001001xxx11001100and we store the vector under each of the three keys. This creates duplication of data, but allows us to find vectors when only some of the groups that make up the hash match. We also need to introduce an additional step before returning our results to filter out duplicates.Can we do better?That is something I have been thinking about a lot. And it’s not just me — this is fairly cutting edge stuff and lot of people far more clever than me are spending a lot of time coming up with new algorithms to query large volumes of high-dimensional data.I have been playing with different configurations to fine tune precision vs. performance of the system. But at the end of the day, it’s just that — marginal improvements that, while important, don’t drastically change the observed behavior and the (at best) sub-linear performance.I try to look at the problem from a different angle, too. My system stores a large number of vectors that might be used shortly after being stored but more often than not aren’t used at all. It’s only a small subset of vectors that end up being returned in majority of cases as most similar.What if we were more aggressive about reducing the overall size of the dataset?My plan is to implement of time-to-live (TTL), concept well known in caching, to only keep vectors “used” (retrieved) in certain window of time (and re-new TTL every time the vector is used, perhaps even with a sliding window — first TTL to be 1 hour, after the vector is “used”, next TTL will be 1 day, then 1 week, and so on…). That, combined with the ability to disable TTL for some vectors, should allow me to purge large number of vectors from the data set and worry little less about performance of the algorithm.Another thing to consider in future is parallel processing. We could partition our data set to be stored and queried on different nodes and then combine partial results into a final result (map-reduce). Perhaps, that will be another interesting topic to write about soon?",,,,,,,,,2019-09-06T16:16:07.912Z,c404efade360,['Ondrej Stastny'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Modern ANNs, often also called Deep Learning (DL), have increased tremendously in complexity such that machines can train themselves to process and learn from data that has been supplied to them as input, and almost match human performance in many tasks. However, how they arrive at decisions is unknown, making them less useful when the reason for decisions is necessary.This work has been performed by Dr Vineeth N Balasubramanian, Associate Professor, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Hyderabad, and his students Aditya Chattopadhyay, Piyushi Manupriya, and Anirban Sarkar. Their work has recently been published in the Proceedings of 36th International Conference on Machine Learning, considered worldwide to be one of the highest-rated conferences in the area of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Speaking about this research, Dr. Vineeth Balasubramanian said, “The simplest applications that we know of Deep Learning (DL) is in machine translation, speech recognition or face detection. It enables voice-based control in consumer devices such as phones, tablets, television sets and hands-free speakers. New algorithms are being used in a variety of disciplines including engineering, finance, artificial perception and control and simulation. Much as the achievements have wowed everyone, there are challenges to be met.”A key bottleneck in accepting such Deep Learning models in real-life applications, especially risk-sensitive ones, is the ‘interpretability problem.’ The DL models, because of their complexity and multiple layers, become virtual black boxes that cannot be deciphered easily. Thus, when a problem arises in the running of the DL algorithm, troubleshooting becomes difficult, if not impossible, said Dr Vineeth Balasubramanian. The DL algorithms are trained on a limited amount of data that are most often different from real-world data. Furthermore, human error during training, and unnecessary correlations in data can result in errors that must be corrected, which becomes hard. “If treated as blackboxes, there is no way of knowing whether the model actually learned a concept or a high accuracy was just fortuitous,” added Dr Vineeth Balasubramanian.The practical implications of the lack of transparency in DL models are that end-users can lose their trust over the system. There is thus a need for methods that can access the underbelly of the AI programs and unravel their structure and functions. The IIT Hyderabad team approached this problem with ANN architectures using causal inference with what is known in the field as a ‘Structural Causal Model.’ Explaining this area of work, Dr Balasubramanian said, “Thanks to our students’ efforts and hard work, we have proposed a new method to compute the Average Causal Effect of an input neuron on an output neuron. It is important to understand which input parameter is ‘causally’ responsible for a given output; for example in the field of medicine, how does one know which patient attribute was causally responsible for the heart attack? Our (IIT Hyderabad researchers’) method provides a tool to analyze such causal effects.”Transparency and understandability of the workings of DL models are gaining importance as discussions around the ethics of Artificial intelligence grows, added Dr Balasubramanian on the importance of his team’s work on ‘explainable machine learning.’ This makes sense given that the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regulation requires that an explanation must be provided if a machine learning model is used for any decisions made on its citizens, on any domain, be it banking, security or health.The code developed by the IIT Hyderabad researchers to understand the workings of DL models, is available for free at https://piyushi-0.github.io/ACE/.
