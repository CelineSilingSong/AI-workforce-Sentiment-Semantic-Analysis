Asana's Work Innovation Lab has just released the State of AI at Work 2024 report, and it is one of the most comprehensive pieces of research regarding generative AI to date. The report discusses surprising use cases for the technology at work, breaks down the path to widespread AI usage, and explores adoption mindsets and the journey organizations must embark upon. This report moves the research and discussion beyond who is using AI and for what purpose and gets into the nuance of what it means, how it feels, and what opportunities it unlocks. All statistics referenced throughout the rest of this article are from Asana's report.


A new way for companies to assess where they are on their AI journey
Companies are at an AI tipping point. More than half (52%) of knowledge workers now use generative AI weekly — a 44% increase in just nine months. People are using it whether companies have a plan for AI or not — and only 31% of companies have a formal AI strategy in place. Those companies without a plan had better pick up the pace.

A good starting point is to figure out where they are on Asana's AI maturity model, which is detailed in the report. It consists of five stages: skepticism, activation, experimentation, scaling, and maturity. Rebecca Hinds, head of the Asana Work Innovation Lab, discusses the maturity model and the highlights of the report.

PROMOTED
When it comes to adoption, ""It's not that everyone should be at stage five,"" Hinds says. ""Rather, it's about how you get to that next step of the maturity curve.""

That journey itself brings opportunities and challenges. ""What stood out to me was how the concerns change as you move step to step,"" says Hinds. ""Concerns are inevitable, and they are healthy, but if you are less mature in your implementation of AI, the concerns are going to center on comprehension and understanding of how to use the technology. As companies reach those more mature stages, concerns shift toward ethics and responsible AI.""
This is a helpful guideline for how organizations should tailor their approach. Less mature companies should probably focus on comprehension, whereas those who have fully embedded AI will be more focused on ethics and re-designing jobs.

AI adoption is about mastering mindsets
55% of workers feel optimistic about using generative AI compared to just six months ago, and that optimism undoubtedly fuels experimentation. The top use cases for AI at work are email generation, information summarization, content generation, technical writing, ideation and brainstorming, and data analysis.

""The use case that stood out to me was brainstorming,"" says Hinds. ""There's this overwhelming narrative that the one aspect of human work AI can't take over is the creative thinking, brainstorming, and ideation."" A theory the study posits is that generative AI can help overcome ""blank page syndrome"" as well as provide feedback on initial ideas before they are shared in a group brainstorming setting.

Leadership modeling is one of the most important tools for any behavior change initiative, and executives are embracing AI at higher rates than people at all other levels of the organization. While 69% of executives report using generative AI at work at least weekly, only 43% of individual contributors do the same.
""Executives are more confident in their own skill set, and they are less concerned about job replacement,"" says Hinds. ""This is largely because they are responsible for strategic work that has yet to be replaced — most skill displacement at the moment is with administrative tasks.""
""So much of the learning at the moment is happening through personal experimentation and personal exposure, and a lot of executive learning is coming from conferences and that exposure has been helpful for executives to at least understand potential use cases of the technology,"" she says. This highlights a resource gap in training provided for executives and individual contributors. Executives are twice as likely to say that their organization has allocated budget for generative AI training.
Companies need to train their people and encourage experimentation, but framing messages correctly is incredibly important to overcome hesitancy in adoption — especially in unfamiliar areas. 64% of knowledge workers have little to no familiarity with the generative AI tools they could use at work. They're less enthusiastic about it as well, with only 50% being excited about the possibilities of AI vs 67% of executives.
""The way we frame technology in the stories we tell and the metaphors we use as we bring them into our organization matters — and it matters significantly for those individual contributors,"" says Hinds. She also isolates the word ""artificial"" as particularly problematic. ""It seems less real, more scary, and more like a black box. Why can't we replace it with 'amplified' or 'augmented' to convey that this technology is meant to amplify our human skills? It's not meant to be in conflict.""
Where's the best place to start embedding AI throughout the organization?
Hinds points out that AI is only going to improve. Therefore, this is the prime time to experiment with AI and learn with the technology as new models develop. You can't just dabble and expect to see results, though. 39% of ""dabblers"" report productivity gains whereas 89% of daily users report productivity gains. The message to employees is: start experimenting.
For companies, Hinds also has a clear starting point. ""One step you can take, no matter where your organization is on its AI journey, is to establish a set of principles for AI. Often executives will push back against having a concrete policy for AI, saying that it's too early for official guidelines, but even if you're super early on your journey, you can put together a list of principles in terms of how you see the role AI plays in your organization. What are your underlying beliefs in how the technology should be used?""
Hinds emphasizes that humans are at the heart of this. ""We should be building for human and AI teams and adopting a human-centric approach."" Even if they don't understand the technology, they still need to know the intention of bringing it into the workplace. ""When people see AI as a teammate rather than a tool, they're interacting with it differently. They tend to think more broadly about the use cases and how they can work with the technology — not just what it can do for them.""

Study finds UK organisations broadly deploying generative AI to support existing jobs, but execs say employment not affected

 Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is not yet replacing jobs in the UK, but is being broadly deployed to support existing roles, a study has found, indicating that fears the technology would have an immediate effect on employment may have been exaggerated.
Nearly three-quarters of UK tech leaders, such as chief information officers and chief technology officers, said they had deployed generative AI to at least some employees, but 99 percent said it was not yet replacing jobs, found the Tuesday study by digital services consultancy Nash Squared.
More than half of respondents were instead using generative AI to support existing jobs, the study found.
“In our discussions with tech leaders there is a sense that its impact will be evolutionary rather than revolutionary,” said Nash Squared chief executive Bev White.

AI business case
She added that the study indicated organisations with company-wide generative AI deployments were actually more likely than the average to be increasing tech headcount over the next year.
Organisations are rapidly bringing in policies and even chief officers to specifically handle generative AI, with the number of firms with such policies doubling over the past six months.
One in twenty UK-based firms now have chief AI officers, a figure Nash said it expects to rise over time to one in ten.
Nearly 40 percent of UK tech leaders said they remained concerned about the misuse of generative AI tools while more than half, or 55 percent, said they had yet to find a clear business case for them beyond personal productivity.

Budgets were also a constraining factor, with 27 percent citing this as an impediment to rolling out the technology.
A recent study found that public awareness of generative AI lagged far behind the industry’s hype around the technology, with 30 percent of respondents in the UK saying they had never heard of it.
Tech investment
Investment in technology generally remained strong for UK tech leaders, with 43 percent expecting to increase their tech budget in the next 12 months and just over one-third expecting to increase their tech headcount.
Sixty-seven percent said they were being held back by the economy, but there was a general expectation that things would bounce back by the start of next year.
Firms have also begun increasing the number of days employees were expected in the office, with 19 percent doing so in the past six months, typically moving from 2-3 days to 3 days.
Some 87 percent said they found hybrid arrangements were working ‘quite’ or ‘extremely well’, but the study noted that more days in the office did have an impact on issues such as diverse hiring.
Sixty-six percent of UK tech leaders said progress on sustainability had either stayed the same or declined, and a similar 68 percent reported the same with diversity initiatives.

The remarkable rise of generative artificial intelligence opened a universe of potential and brought a flood of founders and investors into the sector. 
As a result, Generative AI will usher in a new age of human creativity, but only once we work with it properly. 





Generative AI’s most profound implications and incredible possibilities are in creativity and content, where you find the challenges that will shape its future. 
Understanding Generative AI’s current shortcomings and how to remedy them will determine future success. The “first movers” of the AI craze involve industries and sectors with seriously outdated processes; it took Generative AI to start a change, but anything would have helped. 
But first, companies need to focus on the right problems and create models that enable human brilliance and continuously capture it.
Why what works for process does not work for content
The problems with content stem from a process that was under no pressure to evolve for centuries. Newspapers and TV channels, for example, had a virtual monopoly on the flow of verified information into society, until, suddenly, they didn’t.  
- A message from our partner -
The effect of this legacy is starkest in journalism. The loss of impactful but labour-intensive work, like investigations, and the urge to drive traffic through extreme biases and sensationalism are harming the world. Quantity rose, but quality fell away. 
And that is key to understanding the issue facing Generative AI. 
The hard part is not “Generating” the work. The hard part is conceiving the idea, finding new information, choosing how to present it, and then presenting it. It is a shifting confluence of quantifiable and intangible factors that inform a good content decision. 





It is ridiculous to think that automating creative micro-decisions that factor in culture, moments in time, society, and language will produce good content. 
You can automate to average at best – only by relying on information, media assets, and observations made outside your automation. 
For the first movers, it is straightforward to feed financial, harvest, or supply chain data into a model that brings it up at a demand. This disguises the “hard parts”, gathering the data (the work of many people over many years) and then the end-decision, or combined effect of a series of decisions, made by highly specialised people. 
To make original, accurate, and valuable content requires nuanced judgements enabled by being close to throughput – the entire production line behind the final output of content. 
Both the inputs and outputs of a single piece of creative work require subtleties of judgement of equal importance to any larger-scale decisions – and if the labour-saving factors do not perfectly alleviate the need to make those decisions, those process stages are not improved. 
In fact, in that scenario they’ve become worse: if you have to edit a single sentence or brush-stroke, being distanced from the labour becomes a severe disadvantage. Anyone who takes a minor creative risk – a quirk in their video, or a play in words that tests the rules of grammar – beats everything you produce. 
Even if you nail it, content evolves so subtly and so quickly, you end up in the same position. The less labour-intensive it becomes, the faster it evolves and the faster audience expectations rise. 
Tools change, but people don’t. Spellcheck did not eliminate the need for literacy – it just made us write faster. 
Reimagining people, AI, and process for a new content reality
AI will always work best when built around the fundamental skills and creative powers of actual – good – journalists, creatives, and writers: to originate a story, fact-check it, and approve it for publication; to conceive ambitious artwork, refine it, and bring it together. 
This is not a prophecy of doom – it’s the start of a revolutionary age for creativity. This is why I created my company and spent 5 years proving it across every possible scenario. Those who do content well will win big, but that means combining human brilliance with AI as a solution. 





The latest Google update obliterated a host of companies using generative AI to spam the world. I’ve seen this happen up close – a client insisted on using us for localisation only, and used ChatGPT to lay out their drafts. It went well for 6 weeks – then their entire investment went up in smoke. 
There is already a lot of content—content about everywhere and everything—but it is rarely informative, assuming it is accurate. We do not need more. 
That client experiment happened before Google’s update – it was natural selection. 
Authority in content will proliferate as specialists in niche areas emerge, their quality standing out from a sea of mediocrity. That means the winners will also become the de facto authorities for their niches. 
General-purpose, average content rapidly becomes useless. Even if that content has great SEO, Search is adapting to the new reality, and even if optimised-but-average content gets traffic for now, it will lose audience trust. 
How mistakes in generative AI happen
Every time a new tool comes on the market to “solve” some content aspect, another countdown begins. 
Huge investment is going into Generative AI wrappers that have focused use cases but no competency in originating the inputs they get from ChatGPT. Even those that approach it differently have the same flawed assumptions about the product. 
Using GPT-4 or an equivalent to automate a structure for SEO, by definition, guarantees that those structures will end up classed as spam, whether by search engines or by people. 
People are pouring money in because they can understand and contextualise the application of Generative AI with other technologies, but it is a victim of the same forces that plagued content investments. 
Those who know content are not thinking differently; those who think differently don’t know enough about content to understand the problems to solve, let alone how to break the problems down into solvable processes. They either don’t credit disciplines other than their own (usually coding and climbing academic ladders) or think automating to a finished product will de facto eliminate the issue. 





The best example is “fact-checking.” What startups really mean is corroborating via news sources or Wikipedia, etc. – this is not real fact-checking (which goes much deeper). It kills the chance for editorial judgements on information and the opportunity for subtle style changes. 
The developers may not see that as either possible or relevant – and that is precisely why they are not qualified to make these judgements. Content specialists, journalists, and media leaders share the blame here: holdover attitudes from before the digital age stifle original thinking and remain prevalent across age cohorts. 
The safest route, so the thinking goes, is to make tools. That can work, but not to the potential that Generative AI should carry. 
Investors want to back tools they can license. Imagine the best-case scenario: a dream client plugs all these new AI solutions into their centralised system. Now, they theoretically have less to do – but even if it works perfectly, internal and external expectations shift, and they suddenly have to manage a Frankenstein monster of plugins for just a subtle difference. That is more work, not less, just to maintain an average outcome. 
Founders and investors who do not understand how the above scenario is inevitable will be ruthlessly punished by the market. There is no out-spending that fate. 
Why solving Generative AI reveals the future of work
Content is about people, society, and how we think. It is the basic social function of communicating an idea – through both language and all that is left unsaid – from one person to another. Whether a mock bird call in the jungle, an immersive VR experience of the aftermath of war, or rebellious fashion trends. 
What sets Generative AI apart from prevailing wisdom is that the enormity of its potential demands a correspondent revolution in content processes. 
Generative AI demands a total rethink of how we work with technology, and how to reconstitute work itself. 





Everything from how content is made, to how expertise is cultivated – even how people are found, trained, and engaged – has to be remade to fit a system that enables higher thinking. That system can then enable the capture of “higher thought”, leading to the cultivation of Generative AI models with functions that have lasting creative and informational utility. 
To do this, every element of these Generative AI systems has to be radically different from what came before. That includes how you develop talent as well as technology. 
Every process must deliver efficiency gains on its own, work as part of a grander whole, and allow for managing, adjusting, and optimising AI throughout the system. The leaps of efficiency these radical changes demand must be apparent at scale, at the micro level, and when evaluating every element independently. 
This is how you build the flexibility creativity demands into a Generative AI solution. 
Integrating people with technology
Content has a bright future – the brightest ever – but it will only come by moving us closer to the core of what content really is: extracting an intangible “idea” out of the world and getting it to other human brains. 
Current Generative AI thinking distances people from influencing content’s communicative core, and that needs to change. 
Changing processes in this way will be extraordinarily difficult, from understanding the necessity to conceiving how and all the way through to implementation. It will take a lot of hard work to accomplish these goals. 
And so it should. 
What comes after will be the true age of creativity, dwarfing anything humanity achieved before. It is worth the struggle.

For lawyers who conduct legal research, this can be a reality, thanks to the launch of AI-assisted research on the Westlaw Precision Australia platform by Thomson Reuters.Typically, legal work, including research, can take days or even weeks, based on the complexities and nuances of the law and facts in any case. In Westlaw Precision Australia, lawyers can ask the AI-assisted tool a legal question, just as they might ask a trusted colleague. The tool reads and responds to the question at superhuman speed, using Thomson Reuters’ trusted content.As AI technology aids the legal profession by simplifying research, James Jarvis, the vice-president of global legal solutions for Thomson Reuters Asia and emerging markets, says there are enormous implications for lawyer workflow and the profession more broadly.View image in fullscreen“This is at the heart of AI-assisted research on Westlaw Precision Australia; less time hunting for relevant information unlocks time to focus on other things, such as the quality of work product and legal strategy,” he says.If lawyers spend less time finding the law, they have more time to spend on creative advice and strategy to achieve the best outcomes for clients.Jarvis says Thomson Reuters is developing responsible AI focused on augmenting and accelerating how lawyers work, rather than trying to replace them with technology.Driven by natural language, generative AI is human centricThomson Reuters is synonymous with information. The company has been a provider of legal information in Australia since 1898. Globally, it leads knowledge communities with technology-based solutions across law, news and media, tax and accounting.For more than a decade, AI has been used in Westlaw to enable information retrieval and document summarisation. The difference with Westlaw Precision Australia is that large language models (LLMs) have improved search responses in unprecedented ways.Generative AI that uses LLMs is based on transformers trained on massive datasets – this is what the large refers to – enabling the network to learn context and meaning. It’s the learning and language that are key here.View image in fullscreen

LLMs recognise, summarise, and generate natural language and content. Thomson Reuters’ use of LLMs is specifically focused on the legal information they provide to Australian lawyers.“When answering the lawyer’s question,” Jarvis says, “we focus the LLM on the exact language of Australian law, and we tell the AI: ‘Don’t just answer the question based on your statistical understanding of language patterns; use that understanding and specifically use it with these Australian cases, legislation and regulations.’One of the most powerful advances is generative AI’s capacity for understanding context, which makes results customised, adaptive and intelligible.The rapidly advancing technology is only as relevant as the customers and clients at the centre of these deep learning technologies, Jarvis says. “Generative AI legal search on Westlaw Precision Australia is enabled by a conversational user experience, which humanises and simplifies our sophisticated legal technology, making it easier for lawyers to use every day.”Unlocking value through the power of generative AIAI-assisted research on Westlaw Precision Australia analyses and identifies Australian primary law relevant to the lawyer’s often complex and nuanced questions, delivering answers that are synthesised from the relevant passages of the law. Footnotes to the passages in identifiable legal authorities ensure accuracy and confidence, because the AI response is based on Australian law.View image in fullscreenThis is light years away from keywords and Boolean searches that restricted results to exact matches and required the lawyer to review long lists of cases, statutes and regulations.“This is Thomson Reuters’ responsible AI at its best, shifting much of the research from the lawyer to the technology,” Jarvis says. “We’re accelerating and augmenting a thorough research process.”There can be no doubt that AI is exponentially transforming our working lives, but lawyers have a low tolerance for bias, so the tools they use must be trustworthy and authoritative, not just fast.“What we do know is firms are increasingly actively looking at ways to drive more value from the time they are given back,” Jarvis says.Time translates to value, but the process must be trusted for it to be useful. Jarvis says the advantages that AI offers are in step with the trusted technological solutions Thomson Reuters has always delivered.Generative AI is changing the legal profession and Thomson Reuters’ Westlaw Precision AI-assisted research is leading the way.Explore more on these topicsThomson Reuters: AI futuresadvertisement featuresShareReuse this content",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Generative AI Set to Disrupt Jobs and Widen Inequality, IMF Warns

 18 June 2024 In Business, Technology  Business Matters 





The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has issued a stark warning about the profound labour disruptions and inequality that generative AI may cause, urging governments to bolster economic protections to safeguard their economies.

In a recent report, the IMF highlighted that advancements in AI technology could lead to significant job market disruptions, particularly affecting higher-skilled professions. Unlike previous technological shifts, generative AI might result in substantial job losses in roles requiring advanced skills, potentially exacerbating economic disparities.
To address these challenges, the IMF recommends that governments strengthen unemployment insurance and other safety nets to support workers displaced by AI advancements. Enhancing these measures is essential to protecting the well-being of citizens and maintaining economic stability.
Despite these concerns, the IMF acknowledges AI’s potential to boost productivity and enhance public service delivery. However, the rapid adoption of this technology introduces significant risks that must be managed carefully. In response, the European Union has proposed the AI Act, a comprehensive regulation aimed at mitigating AI-related dangers, including potentially banning applications that threaten safety and fundamental rights.
**Educational and Training System Updates**
Preparing for the future requires updating education and training systems. As the job market evolves, there will be a greater need for lifelong learning and opportunities for workers to reskill and adapt to new roles. The IMF’s report emphasizes the importance of sector-based training, apprenticeships, and reskilling programs to help workers transition to new tasks and sectors in an AI-driven economy.
“We want people to benefit broadly from the potential that this technology holds and ensure that opportunities are created for them,” said Era Dabla-Norris, deputy director at the IMF’s fiscal affairs department and co-author of the report. She noted that the “transition could be painful for workers” facing longer unemployment spells due to a lack of necessary skills in the age of AI, which may require more time to acquire than in the past.
**Industry Insights**
Sheila Flavell CBE, COO of FDM Group, stressed the need for a collaborative effort between government, education, and industry to provide a level playing field and ensure staff can safely maximise AI benefits. She advocated for a combination of apprenticeship schemes and upskilling and reskilling programmes to create digitally adept multigenerational workforces.
Dr Adeshola Cole, CEO of Tritek Consulting, emphasised the importance of staff equipping themselves with the necessary skills to manage AI development. He highlighted the rush by organisations to adopt AI tools, often without having the digitally skilled staff to manage AI risks, underscoring the need for practical sector-based training.
Sai Bendi, Software Development Manager at Encompass Corporation, pointed out that employers must provide the learning and development support needed for individuals to keep up with technological changes and feel confident in utilising AI solutions effectively.
As generative AI continues to transform industries, the IMF’s warning underscores the urgency for comprehensive strategies to manage its impact on the job market and ensure equitable economic growth.

<p>""AI is a business imperative. With generative AI being used by 88% of knowledge workers at work, it is impressive to see employees in Hong Kong are much more willing to empower themselves to adopt innovations than most other regions.

A significant 86% of AI users are bringing their own AI tools to work, indicating a high level of personal investment in the technology.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is also noteworthy that 23%&nbsp;of AI power users likely heard about the importance of using generative AI at work from their CEO, showing a top-down approach to promoting AI adoption.</p>

Alex Gay, Sr. Director of Product Marketing, Adobe Document Cloud 
Enterprise knowledge workers face numerous obstacles that hinder their productivity, including information overload, manual data entry, and repetitive tasks. Documents are at the center of their work, containing critical information that knowledge workers need to extract, analyze, and transform into valuable insights. That is where AI comes in; it has immense potential to help knowledge workers quickly analyze large volumes of data, identify patterns, and provide valuable insights. Today, we announced new advances in Acrobat AI Assistant with those benefits in mind, helping customers unlock new levels of productivity by supercharging their document-related tasks including data extraction, summarization, content generation, and review. 
But exactly how much time is saved? What are the quantifiable productivity gains? To better assess the impact that AI Assistant has on enterprise productivity, we commissioned benchmark research conducted by Pfeiffer Consulting to analyze the efficiency and productivity gains of AI Assistant across various lines of business. ​ The study covered 16 real-world workflow scenarios in Sales, Human Resources, Legal & Compliance, Marketing & Communications, Finance, and Research & Development. ​
The research findings revealed that Acrobat AI Assistant was on average four times faster than traditional methods for 16 different knowledge worker tasks. ​For complex assignments, such as summarizing complex safety protocols, AI Assistant saved almost two hours. ​ The research reported that by speeding up time-consuming and repetitive tasks, AI Assistant frees up time, concentration, and creativity for higher-value aspects of a project. ​ The versatility of AI Assistant allows it to execute a variety of document-related tasks, including providing insights, answering questions, retrieving, and organizing information, comparing documents, and composing texts in various styles. ​
Driving productivity gains across all departments
The research highlighted 5 key lines of business that represent common tasks and challenges faced by knowledge workers. Each covered different levels of complexity, from simple fact-finding tasks to more complex assignments such as summarizing safety protocols or creating detailed presentations based on industry trend reports: 

Sales: Traditionally, summarizing a product brochure, creating a short presentation, and summarizing findings in an email for clients took 46 minutes. ​ However, with AI Assistant, the same workflow could be completed in under 12 minutes, representing time savings of over 70%. ​This allows sales professionals to focus on higher-value aspects of their work, such as client interactions and strategic planning. ​
Human Resources: Human resource professionals spend a significant amount of time digging for information across multiple documents, including resumes, employee records, and policy documents. With AI Assistant, HR professionals completed tasks in significantly less time. For example, summarizing leave benefits from an employee handbook took under five minutes with AI Assistant, compared to almost 20 minutes without it. This enables HR professionals to be more efficient in sharing information with executives and employees.
Legal: Creating a legal brief from a research report traditionally took just under one hour. ​ AI Assistant reduced the time spent on this task to just under nine minutes by prompting the five key subjects and copying and pasting the results into Word for further editing. ​ This significant time-saving allows legal professionals to allocate more time to other critical tasks.
Research & Development: ​ AI Assistant resulted in a substantial reduction in time spent on administrative tasks in the research and development domain, which can help drive more efficiency and focus on core research activities, leading to faster innovation and development cycles. ​​
Marketing & Communications: ​ Creating a blog post from a 3000-word article traditionally took nearly an hour and a half. ​ AI Assistant reduced the time it takes to write the blog post by less than a third, thanks to its ability to generate two versions of the blog post. ​ The writer can then paste the blog post into Word for additional editing and refinement. ​ This time-saving allows marketers to produce content more efficiently.

The City of Gilbert, Arizona is one example of a large organization using AI to turn document data into actionable insights and free up time for more valuable tasks. 
“With one of the highest population growth rates in the country, Gilbert, Arizona is undergoing rapid transformation, and our organization is exploring AI technologies to support this growth,” said Eugene Meijia, Chief AI Strategy and Transformation Officer, City of Gilbert, Arizona. “We see a lot of potential in Adobe Acrobat AI Assistant to enable our town to significantly cut down the time it takes to review and update policy documents, synthesize large plans or proposals, and analyze prior events. With Adobe’s document expertise and approach to protecting the integrity of data and AI responses, getting our security and compliance team on board with Adobe was quite straightforward.” 
Adapting to knowledge worker styles
AI Assistant caters to both non-specialized and specialized knowledge workers. ​ Non-specialized users, such as students, bloggers, social media professionals, and HR assistants, can benefit from AI Assistant’s ability to quickly parse and extract data from PDFs and generate summaries. ​ Specialized users, such as auditors, patent attorneys, financial analysts, contract attorneys, and senior research scientists, can leverage AI Assistant to streamline complex tasks involving specialized material. ​ It enables them to retrieve specific information, perform comparisons and compilations, structure documents, and even generate sophisticated texts based on document content. ​
The Pfeiffer research highlights the diverse advantages AI Assistant offers across various business sectors, from HR to research and development. These benefits include boosted productivity, diminished manual effort, enhanced accuracy, and improved compliance. It also underscores that AI Assistant significantly streamlines document-related tasks, enabling knowledge workers to focus on more valuable activities that drive business success. Download the full report and learn more about how customers can use AI Assistant to supercharge their productivity here.

Among recent updates and controversies including high-level defections, last month the company quietly announced Media Manager, scheduled for release in 2025.

But this does nothing to address the fact that the company built its foundational models using authors’ and other creators’ works without consent, compensation or control over how OpenAI users will be able to imitate the artists’ styles to create new works. As it’s described, Media Manager puts the burden on creators to protect their work and fails to address the company’s past legal and ethical transgressions. This overture is like having your valuables stolen from your home and then hearing the thief say, “Don’t worry, I’ll give you a chance to opt out of future burglaries ... next year.” Advertisement             Hollywood Inc.   Apple announces deal with OpenAI. Will it be a game-changer?   Apple announced new artificial intelligence-powered tools, including a partnership with OpenAI that allows Siri to surface answers from ChatGPT. June 10, 2024   Writers, artists, journalists and other creative workers have consistently asked that OpenAI and other generative AI companies obtain creators’ consent before using their work to train artificial intelligence products, and that the organizations refrain from using works without express permission. Last July, more than 16,000 authors signed a letter to leading AI companies demanding that the businesses obtain permission and pay for works they use to train their AI. Yet OpenAI continues to trample on artists’ rights and rebuff their appeals, as we saw recently when it launched a ChatGPT audio assistant with a voice similar to Scarlett Johansson’s despite the actor’s clear and repeated refusals.Although Johansson won her battle — OpenAI “paused” the offending voice from its offerings after the actor threatened legal action — the best chance for the wider community of artists is to band together. AI companies’ cavalier attitude toward creators’ rights and consent extends to people at all levels of fame.         Hollywood Inc.   Scarlett Johansson also thinks OpenAI’s new voice sounds like her. She’s not happy about it   Johansson, who portrayed the voice of a computer program in ‘Her,’ was not behind OpenAI’s ‘Sky’ voice assistant. Another actor provided the voice, OpenAI said. May 20, 2024   Last year the Authors Guild, along with 17 other plaintiffs, sued OpenAI and Microsoft, demanding that authors receive what they are due. That suit is ongoing and other creative professionals and copyright owners have also taken legal action. Among these are a class action filed by visual artists against Stability AI, Runway AI, Midjourney and Deviant Art, a lawsuit by music publishers against Anthropic for infringement of song lyrics, and suits in the U.S. and U.K. brought by Getty Images against Stability AI for copyright infringement of photographs.   AI companies often argue that it would be impossible for them to license all the content that they need and that doing so would bring progress to a grinding halt. This is simply untrue. OpenAI has signed a succession of licensing agreements with publishers large and small. While the exact terms of these agreements are rarely released to the public, the compensation estimates pale in comparison with the vast outlays for computing power and energy that the company readily spends. Payments to authors would have minimal effects on AI companies’ war chests, but receiving royalties for AI training use would be a meaningful new revenue stream for a profession that’s already suffering.Authors’ earnings have been in precipitous decline for more than a decade. In 2022, the median annual writing-related income for full-time writers was just over $20,000, down nearly 50% from 2009. And the data for 2023 look even more dire. AI-generated books, sometimes listed as written by real authors without the writer’s permission, flood Amazon, where anyone searching might buy them instead of the creative work the human author spent months or years writing. Meanwhile, OpenAI is valued at $80 billion, Anthropic at $18.4 billion and French AI startup Mistral at $6.2 billion. These companies claim they need our work to succeed but can’t afford to pay for it. Any human author can tell you that this narrative has blatant inconsistencies.We cannot trust tech companies that swear their innovations are so important that they do not need to pay for one of the main ingredients — other people’s creative works. The “better future” we are being sold by OpenAI and others is, in fact, a dystopia. It’s time for creative professionals to stand together, demand what we are owed and determine our own futures.

The Air Force and Space Force last week unveiled their own experimental tool — the Non-classified Internet Protocol Generative Pre-Training Transformer, or NIPRGPT. And in 2023, the Navy rolled out a conversational AI program called Amelia that sailors could use to troubleshoot problems or provide tech support.Swanson said she’s optimistic about the potential for generative AI, especially for laborious specialties like contract writing and policy where automation could release some strain on the Army’s workforce.“In the area of contracts and in the area of policy, I think there’s a huge return on investment for us,” she said. “Might [AI] one day be able to write a contract? We hope so. But we’ve got to pilot and test it and make sure everybody’s comfortable with it first.”The large language model the service will use for the effort is different from systems like ChatGPT, Swanson said, because it is trained on Army data. It will also provide citations that indicate where the data it provides originated, a feature that will help the service fact-check that information.The pilot is part of a broader effort within the Army to identify both the pitfalls and the opportunities that come with widely adopting AI tools. In March, the service announced a 100-day plan focused on reducing the risk associated with integrating AI algorithms.As part of that exercise, Swanson said, the Army reviewed its spending on AI research and found that testing and security are the two biggest gaps toward fielding these tools more broadly. The service also identified 32 risks and 66 mitigations it can implement to reduce their impact. Further, it created a generative AI policy that it will apply to the pilot in order to set parameters for the effort. That policy includes a requirement that there be a “human in the loop.”The generative AI pilot will lead into the next phase of the effort — a 16-month focus on how to use the technology operationally. Findings from that work will inform the Army’s budget for fiscal 2026.“So the 100 day plan is setting the conditions — where are we at — and then the 500 day plan is really about operationalizing it,” she said.Florent Groberg, vice president of strategy and optimization at private investment firm AE Industrial partners, said that as the Army moves through these review processes and experiments with AI, it should be transparent with industry about what it wants and then move quickly to leverage the tools companies are developing.“To me, it’s really understanding the framework of what you want to accomplish,” he said during the same panel with Swanson. “Put some boundaries out there and then go do it.”About  Courtney AlbonCourtney Albon is C4ISRNET’s space and emerging technology reporter.

This allows them to spend more time on creative tasks (53%) and with their family (49%), as well as end their work day earlier (45%).Respondents mostly used generative AI to draft communications (44%), summarise long-form content (34%) and brainstorm (34%).The study by enterprise AI and automation company UiPath also found that Singaporean workers believe generative AI tools can drive greater business value. Nearly half (58%) think those tools have the context needed from their business's own data to support business processes and drive value.However, they are concerned about security risks (38%), inaccurate output (34%) and compliance risks (31%) when using generative AI. They also experience a lack of direction around company policy on the use of generative AI tools, with 42% indicating that their company has not offered any training or guidelines on how to use the technology.“To realise Singapore’s ambition to become a global AI hub through the National AI Strategy 2.0, wide adoption of technologies like generative AI and business automation will be critical to sustaining its competitive advantage in a digital economy. For businesses that haven’t been able to turn AI potential into results, automation is a crucial piece of the puzzle that makes AI actionable. To inculcate a more fulfilled workforce, initiatives to plug skill gaps, foster greater trust in AI, as well as strategic private-public partnerships will be key to help workers embrace digital transformation in the age of AI,” says Jess O’Reilly, area vice president for Asia at UiPath.See Also:Click here to stay updated with the Latest Business & Investment News in SingaporeConfronting the generative AI paradox: Unpacking business challengesTech news in less than 5 minutes – June 2024What does it take to strengthen collaboration in a hybrid workplace?Read more stories about where the money flows, and analysis of the biggest market stories from Singapore and around the WorldGet in-depth insights from our expert contributors, and dive into financial and economic trendsFollow the market issue situation with our daily updatesOr want more Lifestyle and Passion stories?

This evolutionary process will have to be coaxed along with high levels of methodological rigor, risk awareness and nimble adaptability—not just from the government but from all interested parties.The conviction comes through between the lines of a June 17 blog post authored by Troy Tazbaz, director of the FDA’s Digital Health Center of Excellence.Launched in 2020 as a branch of the agency’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), the DHCoE works to “foster responsible AI innovations in healthcare,” Tazbaz reminds, “while ensuring these technologies, when intended for use as medical devices, are safe and effective for the end-users, including patients.”Noting the center’s desire to encourage collaboration between healthcare AI stakeholders and its own people, Tazbaz offers three observations to help foster the requisite harmony. 1. Life-cycle planning for AI models can reduce risk. By adopting agreed-upon standards and best practices covering the various phases of AI models’ lifespans, stakeholders can actively help mitigate risks for the long term, Tazbaz suggests. “This includes, for instance, approaches to ensure that data suitability, collection and quality match the intent and risk profile of the AI model that is being trained,” he writes. More:  ‘The healthcare community together could agree on common methodologies that provide information to a diverse range of end users, including patients, on how the model was trained, deployed and managed through robust monitoring tools and operational discipline.’2. Quality-assurance measures can positively impact clinical outcomes.Continuous performance monitoring before, during and after deployment is one way to carry QA through an AI model’s life cycle, Tazbaz points out. Meanwhile transparency and accountability “can help stakeholders feel comfortable with AI technologies.” More: ‘Quality assurance and risk management, right-sized for healthcare institutions of all sizes, can help provide confidence that AI models are developed, tested and evaluated on data that is representative of the population for which they are intended.’3. Shared responsibility can help ensure success. Efforts around AI quality assurance “have sprung up at a grassroots level across the U.S. and are starting to bear fruit,” Tazbaz writes. “Solution developers, healthcare organizations and the U.S. federal government are working to explore and develop best practices for quality assurance of AI in healthcare settings.” More: ‘These efforts, combined with FDA activities relating to AI-enabled devices, may lead to a world in which AI in healthcare settings is safe, clinically useful and aligned with patient safety and improvement in clinical outcomes.”Read the whole thing. Related reading:How to attain and sustain transparency in medical devices outfitted with AI ‘First federal CIO’ gives 3 reality checks on governmental AI Against malpractice for using clinical AI, the best defense is a good offense Dave PearsonDave P. has worked in journalism, marketing and public relations for more than 30 years, frequently concentrating on hospitals, healthcare technology and Catholic communications.

AI is beginning to transform education, training, and workforce development, often in surprising and unexpected ways. At a recent AEI event, Leslie Sizemore, Associate Vice President of the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education talked about how state higher ed is using AI technology to help train students as Advanced Peer Support Specialists (APSS), who help guide individuals through substance use disorder recovery.
Kentucky’s community colleges are experimenting with an AI chatbot with the goal of accelerating learning and guiding students along an integrated career pathway. Using CONVO, a GPT trained on the APSS educational materials, students can engage in realistic scenarios that simulate interactions with individuals with a substance use disorder. These simulations provide a safe environment for students to practice core peer support skills. Their hands-on nature helps to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application and so better prepare students for real-world situations.
CONVO’s 24/7 accessibility and real-time feedback helps create a customized and personalized learning experience. In addition to providing in-depth feedback on students’ interactions, it can suggest conversations, recommend conversational strategies, and reference course material for review. After the conversation, students can share a transcript with their instructor for additional feedback. CONVO also helps students plan their personal educational pathways advising students on course requirements and financial aid resources needed to reach their educational goals.
There’s an important lesson here about education and training programs generally. Our current systems are often unable to offer the kind of tailored instruction needed to improve student and worker performance, especially that of students from disadvantaged backgrounds. As a recent study found, chatbots can help call center workers boost their job performance, productivity, and job satisfaction through interpersonal skills coaching. It increasingly looks like AI could rewrite the rules of education and training, enabling low or no cost tutoring in a wide range of learning and work environments. Such tutors will only become more useful and important as AI’s multimodal capabilities expand and improve. Watch Salman Khan, founder of Khan Academy, and his son demo GPT-4o and try not to be impressed as it provides instantaneous—and humanlike—math coaching.
At its best, technology helps us surpass our natural limitations. Planes enable flight, medicine improves our health and extends our lifespans, and the Internet enables global knowledge-sharing and communication. On its current trajectory, AI may also accelerate skills acquisition, extending our professional capacities and boosting our careers with less of the arduous effort and time-investment that accompanies traditional learning. The potential impact of AI technology in improving and accelerating learning holds great promise for solving some of our most difficult human capital challenges.

The news: Deloitte Australia will begin rolling out its new artificial intelligence platform MyAssist across its workforce after more than a year of development, as part of its strategy to become an ""AI-fueled organisation"".The numbers: The audit and consulting group will roll out MyAssist to its entire workforce of 13,000 from Monday.Deloitte said that a trial of around 1,300 users found that a core set of common tasks can account for up to 50% of the work time of  some users, and it is these tasks that the MyAssist platform has been optimised to support. As part of this trial, 70% of users reported the new platform ""meaningfully improved"" overall work productivity and 65% reported an improvement in work quality. The context: MyAssist offers apps that are optimised for various tasks such as research, content drafting and code development, in addition to general and document chat capabilities. It is also designed to be scaled through the creation of AI-enabled apps by users that address specific business problems, such as personal productivity apps that help users complete multiple related tasks. Deloitte said the functionality in MyAssist builds on the capability and learnings from the company's global network and extends it for the Australian market, in line with Australian regulations and guidelines.
What they said: Deloitte Australia CEO Adam Powick said: ""Generative AI is the most important business productivity tool we have seen for many years, and at Deloitte we are committed to upskilling and equipping everyone in our organisation to use generative AI to improve the speed and quality of work outcomes."" ""MyAssist is a sophisticated and secure generative AI platform which provides users with access to a number of different models and applications supporting common tasks like information research, analysis and evaluation, data handling and code development and testing,"" he said.Deloitte Australia AI Institute lead Kellie Nuttal said: ""GenAI is restructuring the way we work by reducing administrative burdens and allowing resources to be reinvested into higher value activities.""""Our strategy is to be an AI-fuelled organisation,"" she said. ""In the past 12 months more than 5,000 of our people have  undertaken GenAI training and I’m excited to see what they will be able to achieve using MyAssist.""

This post is part of Lifehacker’s “Living With AI” series: We investigate the current state of AI, walk through how it can be useful (and how it can’t), and evaluate where this revolutionary tech is heading next. Read more here.Almost as soon as ChatGPT launched in late 2022, the world started talking about how and when to use it. Is it ethical to use generative AI at work? Is that “cheating?” Or are we simply witnessing the next big technological innovation, one that everyone will either have to embrace, or fall behind dragging their feet?AI is now a part of work, whether you like it or notAI, like anything else, is a tool first and foremost, and tools help us get more done than we can on our own. (My job would literally not be possible without my computer.) In that regard, there’s nothing wrong, in theory, with using AI to be more productive. In fact, some work apps have fully embraced the AI bandwagon. Just look at Microsoft: The company basically conquered the meaning of “computing at work,” and it's adding AI functionality directly into its products.Since last year, the entire Microsoft 365 suite—including Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Teams, and more—has adopted “Copilot,” the company’s AI assist tool. Think of it like Clippy from back in the day, only now way more useful. In Teams, you can ask the bot to summarize your meeting notes; in Word, you can ask the AI to draft a work proposal based on your bullet list, then request it tighten up specific paragraphs you aren’t thrilled with; in Excel, you can ask Copilot to analyze and model your data; in PowerPoint, you can ask for an entire slideshow to be created for you based on a prompt.These tools don’t just exist: They’re being actively created by the companies that make our work products, and their use is encouraged. It reminds me of how Microsoft advertised Excel itself back in 1990: The ad presents spreadsheets as time consuming, rigid, and featureless, but with Excel, you can create a working presentation in an elevator ride. We don’t see that as “cheating” work: This is work.



Intelligently relying on AI is the same thing: Just as 1990's Excel extrapolates data into cells you didn’t create yourself, 2023's Excel will answer questions you have about your data, and will execute commands you give it in normal language, rather than formulas and functions. It’s a tool.What work shouldn’t you use AI for?Of course, there’s still an ethical line you can cross here. Tools can be used to make work better, but they can also be used to cheat. If you use the internet to hire someone else to do your job, then pass that work off as your own, that’s not using the tool to do your work better. That’s wrong. If you simply ask Copilot or ChatGPT to do your job for you in its entirety, same deal. You also have to consider your own company’s guidelines when it comes to AI and the use of outside technology. It’s possible your organization has already established these rules, given AI’s prominence over the past year and a half or so: Maybe your company is giving you the green light to use AI tools within reason. If so, great! But if your company decides you can’t use AI for any purpose as far as work in concerned, you might want to log out of ChatGPT during business hours. But, let’s be real: Your company probably isn’t going to know whether or not you use AI tools if you’re using them responsibly. The bigger issue here is privacy and confidentiality, and it’s something not enough people think about when using AI in general. In brief, generative AI tools work because they are trained on huge sets of data. But AI is far from perfect, and the more data the system has to work with, the more it can improve. You train AI systems with every prompt you give them, unless the service allows you to specifically opt out of this training. When you ask Copilot for help writing an email, it takes in the entire exchange, from how you reacted to its responses, to the contents of the email itself.As such, it’s a good rule of thumb to never give confidential or sensitive information to AI. An easy way to avoid trouble is to treat AI like you would you work email: Only share information with something like ChatGPT you’d be comfortable emailing a colleague. After all, your emails could very well be made public someday: Would you be OK with the world seeing what you said? If so, you should be fine sharing with AI. If not, keep it away from the robots.If the service offers you the choice, opt out of this training. By doing so, your interactions with the AI will not be used to improve the service, and your previous chats will likely be deleted from the servers after a set period of time. Even so, always refrain from sharing private or corporate data with an AI chatbot: If the developer keeps more data than we realize, and they're ever hacked, you could put your work data in a precarious place.

Unlike “traditional” AI which relies on predetermined rules and patterns, generative AI can produce novel content – like text, video, images, and music. In a way, unlike old AI, generative AI can think outside the box. Its implications are profound and sprawling, with the potential to reshape virtually every branch of society.
Conversations about AI often turn on whether it will be a net positive or negative for society, but our new research as part of an international team suggests that acknowledging AI’s apparent paradoxes can help us develop a clearer picture about its risks and potential benefits. We focused on four major areas of society: information, work, education and healthcare.
Work
Digital technologies have a history of skewed benefits. More educated workers benefit while less-educated workers are displaced through automation – a trend known as “skill-biased technological change”. By contrast, generative AI promises to enhance rather than replace human capabilities, potentially reversing this adverse trend. Studies have shown that AI tools like chat assistants and programming aids can significantly boost productivity and job satisfaction, especially for less-skilled workers. 


Nonetheless, uneven access to AI technologies could worsen existing inequalities as those lacking the necessary digital infrastructure or skills get left behind. For example, generative AI is unlikely to have much direct impact on the global south in the near future, due to insufficient investment in the prerequisite digital infrastructure and skills.
School
Generative AI can enhance personal support and adaptability in learning. Chatbot tutors, for instance, are set to transform educational settings by providing real-time, personalised instruction and support. This technology can realise the dream of dynamic, skill-adaptive teaching methods that directly respond to student needs without constant teacher intervention.
Yet, it must be carefully implemented to avoid perpetuating or introducing biases, not only in terms of the information that is fed into AIs but also in how they are used. For instance, a study revealed that female students report using ChatGPT less frequently than their male counterparts. This disparity in technology usage could not only have immediate effects on academic achievement, but also contribute to a future gender gap in the workforce.
Healthcare
Generative AI could help doctors make better choices. But it could also drive them to make worse ones.
Generative AI could augment human capacities in the practice of medicine by guiding practitioners during diagnosis, screening, prognosis and triaging. It could reduce workloads, thereby making medical care more accessible and affordable. One study found that the integration of human and AI judgment led to superior performance compared to either alone, showing just how well humans and AI can work together.
That said, the diagnostic performance of some expert physicians may not be improved by AI. Another study focusing on radiology found that AI can in fact cause incorrect diagnoses in situations that otherwise would have been correctly assessed. This highlights the need for balanced integration that supplements rather than replaces humans.
Disinformation
Will generative AI exacerbate the spread of misinformation or reduce it? Generative AI promises personalised online content, potentially enhancing and customising a user experience. It can also broaden access to content – for instance, via instant language translations or by making it easier for people with disabilities to access content.
However, it also has the potential to be a powerful tool for “surveillance capitalism”. AI may collect massive amounts of personal data that can then be exploited for corporate gain, including by leveraging people’s biases or vulnerabilities.
We’re already seeing the spread of misinformation through advanced and personalised “deepfakes”, and we may soon see AI being used to micro-target voters with persuasive fake content that could significantly affect elections.
Yet, there is also hope that AI can help with these problems. One study found that entering into a dialogue with generative AI significantly reduces conspiracy beliefs among conspiracy believers. The AI appears to be able to answer conspiracy believers’ complex questions about potential conspiracies in a way that no human can.
How should governments respond?
When we looked at how the EU, UK and US were attempting to build regulatory frameworks around these issues, our main observation was that they are falling into the trap of overlooking the potential for AI to aggravate socioeconomic inequalities.
Policy-making should balance AI innovation with social equity and consumer protection. Future regulatory improvements should include equitable tax structures, empowering workers, controlling consumer information, supporting human-complementary AI research, and implementing robust measures against AI-generated misinformation.
We find ourselves at a critical historical crossroads, where today’s decisions will have global consequences for generations to come. It’s an exciting yet daunting moment to be alive, charged with heavy responsibilities. Each of us plays a crucial role as architects of the future. We can all contribute to driving the course towards the positive use of what could be humanity’s greatest innovation, or its worst.

However, a recent study indicates that AI is experiencing a slowdown in evolution after a rapid surge, attributing the initial growth spurt to the abundance of data available on search engines. With the rate of data growth slowing down, the study suggests that AI may struggle to offer anything truly innovative beyond processing existing information.Human Creativity vs. AI: While AI may excel at analyzing big data, human creativity remains unmatched. AI systems are limited to providing answers based on available information, lacking the ability to offer novel solutions or creative insights. Humans, on the other hand, continue to innovate, devise groundbreaking ideas, and tackle problems with ingenuity that AI cannot replicate.The Trust Factor: Another crucial aspect is the level of trust that can be placed in AI to replace human decision-makers. The inherent trust and accountability that humans seek in critical decision-making processes are qualities that AI currently lacks. The need for reasoned discussions, warnings, and consequences delivered by a human touch underscores the irreplaceable role of humans in decision-making.Looking Ahead: As the debate on AI and automation continues, the essence of human ingenuity and adaptability remains paramount. While the allure of AI advancements is undeniable, the unique capabilities of human intellect and creativity ensure that humans will continue to play a pivotal role in shaping the future workforce. The symbiotic relationship between humans and AI is poised to define the future landscape of work, with innovation and human touch remaining indispensable elements in the ever-evolving technological era.Additional Facts:
– One important consideration in the future of work is the rise of the gig economy, where temporary and flexible jobs are more prevalent. This shift can be attributed to technology platforms that connect freelance workers with tasks and projects, providing both opportunities and challenges for workers in terms of job security and benefits.
– Upskilling and reskilling programs are becoming increasingly crucial as technology rapidly evolves. Continuous learning and acquiring new skills are essential for individuals to remain competitive in the workforce, especially in areas where AI and automation are replacing traditional job roles.Key Questions:
1. How can policymakers and businesses ensure a smooth transition for workers affected by automation and AI?
2. What ethical considerations should be addressed when integrating AI into the workforce?
3. How can organizations balance the need for efficiency with the preservation of human creativity and decision-making?Advantages and Disadvantages:
– Advantages: AI and automation can increase productivity, efficiency, and accuracy in various tasks, leading to cost savings and improved outcomes. They can also handle repetitive or dangerous tasks, allowing humans to focus on more complex and creative work.
– Disadvantages: Concerns about job displacement, loss of human touch in interactions, and potential biases in AI algorithms pose challenges. Moreover, the rapid pace of technological advancement may outstrip the ability of some workers to adapt, leading to increased inequality in the workforce.Related Links:

AI skills could soon rival experience when employers select job candidates.
Research from Microsoft, LinkedIn and PwC underlines how quickly AI is changing profiles and suggests how job seekers need to adapt to succeed.
The World Economic Forum’s Good Work Alliance and Education 4.0 framework focus on deploying AI effectively and responsibly and ensuring that education systems provide the next generation of workers with AI skills training.


AI aptitude could soon rival experience when choosing between job candidates. This is according to a new international study by Microsoft and LinkedIn on labour and recruitment trends due to the rise of generative AI. The research also predicts the rise of AI super users as the labour market – which has already undergone significant change in recent years – will shift again.

The 2024 Work Trend Index Annual Report draws on a survey of 31,000 people across 31 countries, hiring trends from LinkedIn, Microsoft 365 productivity data and research with Fortune 500 companies.


Generative AI could give job candidates an edge


The research reveals that three-quarters of people surveyed use generative AI at work, with the majority (78%) bringing their own AI tools into the workplace, especially in small and medium-sized businesses.Play VideoPlaySkip BackwardSkip ForwardUnmuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration 25:43Loaded: 2.31%00:00Stream Type LIVESeek to live, currently behind liveLIVERemaining Time -25:43 1xPlayback RateChaptersChaptersDescriptionsdescriptions off, selectedCaptionscaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedAudio Trackdefault, selectedPicture-in-PictureFullscreenThis is a modal window.Beginning of dialog window.

AI emerges as a tool to help people deal with an increased pace and volume of work that more than two-thirds of respondents struggle with (68%), helping them offload menial tasks.


However, many of those drawing on AI at work fear that doing so might make them look replaceable (53%) and worry that AI could replace their jobs (45%).

But it looks like the opposite could be the case.
Over the past eight years, hiring for technical AI roles was up 323%, and businesses are now turning to non-technical talent with the skills to apply generative AI tools like ChatGPT and Copilot.

Two-thirds of business leaders surveyed say they wouldn’t hire a candidate without AI skills. Nearly three-quarters said they would rather hire a less experienced candidate with AI skills than a more experienced candidate without them.

AI specialist skills command a premium


This trend is consistent with PwC’s 2024 AI Jobs Barometer, which found that jobs requiring AI specialist skills are growing 3.5 times faster than all jobs combined. The exponential need for AI-qualified staff has been on an upward trajectory since 2016 – well before the advent of ChatGPT and other generative AI models.

Moreover, PwC’s analysis of half a billion job ads from 15 countries shows that, on average, AI specialist jobs command up to a 25% premium in pay. While technologists see some of the highest wage premiums, AI skills also pay dividends for professionals such as lawyers, sales and marketing managers, and accountants.

This further underlines that AI skills are needed across roles and industries. The top three occupations that have added AI to their skills and aptitudes on LinkedIn are creatives: content writers, graphic designers and marketing managers. Following hot on their heels are entrepreneurs and business professionals, along with the web and software developers you might more naturally expect to find on the list.
The rise of the AI super user


Workers clearly understand the role of AI for advancing their career prospects.


More than three-quarters of people surveyed for Microsoft and LinkedIn’s 2024 Work Trend Index felt that AI skills will be necessary for staying competitive in the job market. They also view AI knowledge as a way to get promoted faster (69%) and broaden their job opportunities (79%).

And people are acting on it: attendance of LinkedIn Learning courses on AI for non-technical professionals has increased 160% in the past six months.
The research predicts that AI upskilling – whether through formal learning or simply by using AI tools in the workplace – may lead to the rise of ‘AI power users’.

Power users are those who are ahead of the curve in terms of their AI use. They use it several times a week at work, benefitting from making their workload more manageable, boosting their creativity or helping them focus on the most important work. It also makes them feel more motivated and enjoy work more.



How to become an AI power user?


If the research findings are anything to go by, then becoming an AI power user is the way to go to further career progression. So, what are the habits that mark out a power user? According to the 2024 Work Trend Index, it’s some of the following:


Experiment with different ways of using AI: power users are more than two-thirds more likely than other survey respondents to do so.
Always ask yourself, “How can AI help?”: power users are nearly 50% more likely to pause to explore what AI could contribute before tackling a new task, to keep trying if they don’t get the perfect response the first time (+30%), for example, by researching new prompts (+56%).
‘Bookend’ your working day with AI: 9 in 10 power users use AI tools to start their day and get set up for the next day.
Redesign your ways of working with AI and save time: power users are much more likely than other respondents to use AI for a wide range of tasks, including catching up on meetings, analyzing information, designing visual content, brainstorming ideas and even interacting with customers.
Redesign business processes with AI: power users don’t just stop at reorganizing their own ways of working; they are also 66% more likely to redesign entire business processes and workflows in the organization using AI tools.


Getting business and education ready for the AI future


With PwC finding that skillsets for what it terms ‘AI-exposed occupations’ are changing 25% faster than in roles where AI is less relevant, adopting some, if not all, of these habits could dramatically improve people’s future career development.

However, the findings also mean that organizations and educational systems must do major work to prepare the current workforce and future generations for an AI-driven world of work.

As part of its mission to build more resilient, productive, equitable and human-centric workplaces, the World Economic Forum’s Good Work Alliance focuses on deploying AI effectively and responsibly. The Education 4.0 framework aims to ensure education and training systems teach AI skills and leverage AI for better learning.

According to the 2024 Work Trend Index, it’s some of the following: 	Experiment with different ways of using AI: power users are more than two-thirds more likely than other survey respondents to do so. 	Always ask yourself, “How can AI help?”: power users are nearly 50% more likely to pause to explore what AI could contribute before tackling a new task, to keep trying if they don’t get the perfect response the first time (+30%), for example, by researching new prompts (+56%). 	‘Bookend’ your working day with AI: 9 in 10 power users use AI tools to start their day and get set up for the next day. 	Redesign your ways of working with AI and save time: power users are much more likely than other respondents to use AI for a wide range of tasks, including catching up on meetings, analyzing information, designing visual content, brainstorming ideas and even interacting with customers. 	Redesign business processes with AI: power users don’t just stop at reorganizing their own ways of working; they are also 66% more likely to redesign entire business processes and workflows in the organization using AI tools.Getting business and education ready for the AI futureWith PwC finding that skillsets for what it terms ‘AI-exposed occupations’ are changing 25% faster than in roles where AI is less relevant, adopting some, if not all, of these habits could dramatically improve people’s future career development.However, the findings also mean that organizations and educational systems must do major work to prepare the current workforce and future generations for an AI-driven world of work.As part of its mission to build more resilient, productive, equitable and human-centric workplaces, the World Economic Forum’s Good Work Alliance focuses on deploying AI effectively and responsibly. The Education 4.0 framework aims to ensure education and training systems teach AI skills and leverage AI for better learning.This article is republished from World Economic Forum under a Creative Commons license.",,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We’re #1! Survey reveals that Singaporean workers use generative AI the most at work
Jess O’Reilly, Area Vice President, Asia at UiPath. Image source: UiPath.
Singaporean Millennial and Gen Z workers are more likely to use Gen AI tools at work and have seen greater time-saving benefits from implementing these tools compared to older generations. At least that is according to the findings of a global survey of 9,047 full-time employees from nine countries from business automation company UiPath.
According to the survey, 60% of local workers have used generative AI during work hours to solve work problems. These have included, drafting communications (44%), summarising long-form content (34%), and brainstorming (34%).

Uncertainty gives rise to burning out
Against the backdrop of increasingly challenging economic conditions, Singaporean workers are facing increasing workloads and almost a third (30%) of employees in Singapore indicated feeling extremely or very burnt out.
To reduce this, Singaporean workers want their workload reduced (62%), more time and bandwidth to get tasks done (46%), and access to AI and automation, including Gen AI tools (43%).
This is because Gen AI is seen as a potential solution to combat burnout by giving employees time back in their day. 62% of Singaporean workers who use Gen AI at work believe it has saved them time on work-related tasks, with more than 42% saving 10 or more hours.
Jess O’Reilly, Area Vice President, Asia at UiPath said: 
The findings from our survey indicate that Singaporean workers who do utilise both technologies (Gen AI and automation) have seen greater productivity and an improved work life balance. To inculcate a more fulfilled workforce, initiatives to plug skill gaps, foster greater trust in AI, as well as strategic private-public partnerships will be key to help workers embrace digital transformation in the age of AI.
The results of this survey serve to reinforce why the Singapore Government, working with partners DataRobot, IBM, Singtel, and Temasek, launched Project Moonshot. This is a testing toolkit designed to address security and safety challenges often associated with the use of large language models (LLMs), the cornerstone of many AI-driven solutions.

No sign that generative AI is replacing jobs

Increased use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is not replacing jobs, according to a pulse survey of technology leaders.
Research by Nash Squared, a global provider of technology and talent solutions, found that although 74% of UK tech leaders have deployed GenAI to at least some extent to employees, almost all (99%) say it is not replacing jobs.
Half (51%) said they are using GenAI as a personal productivity tool to support existing jobs, to make them more effective.
Bev White, CEO of Nash Squared, said: “Although the ’replace-jobs’ impact of GenAI is headline-grabbing news, in our discussions with tech leaders there is a sense that its impact will be evolutionary rather than revolutionary.
“As organisations change and grow, AI will be stitched into the operations and structure; its impact happening bit by bit. In fact, the pulse survey indicates that organisations with company-wide implementations of GenAI are in fact more likely to be increasing tech headcount in the next year than the average.”
The research also found that, as GenAI is being rapidly rolled out more widely, appointments of a chief AI officer (CAIO) is increasing with one in 20 UK organisations already having a person in the role and a similar proportion planning to appoint one.

But for the majority of organisations, AI strategy still sits with the tech leader, the chief information or technology officers.
The survey also found that to support employees and ensure the safe use of GenAI in their organisations, UK tech leaders have rapidly rolled out GenAI policies, with the number with a policy in place doubling in just six months.
For many, this has been a “retrofit” policy after GenAI has been adopted, but almost four in 10 tech leaders remain concerned about the misuse of GenAI tools.
Tech leaders in the UK see the potential of AI, but 55% have yet to find a clear business case beyond a personal productivity tool, and 27% are struggling with budgetary constraints.
White added: “There’s no doubt there have been some incredible advances. One tech leader mentioned how the last year has seen a giant leap in cancer screening through AI – good news for us all. Another talks about how machine learning has supported the fundraising revenue for their higher education institution, opening access to a wider student population.”
The research found that 43% expect to increase their tech budget, and 36% plan to increase their tech headcount.
Nineteen per cent of respondents say they have increased the number of days employees are expected in the office. For those organisations where employees are mandated to be in the office, the typical time expected has moved from 2-3 days to 3 days. Most leaders are happy with the results: 42% say it is working ‘extremely well’ (up 20% in six months), while 45% say ‘quite well’, although some say more days in the office does have consequences, especially on diverse hiring.
The survey was carried out in May 2024 among 322 tech leaders globally including 182 in the UK.

In a 2018 Financial Times article, The Long Wait for a Productivity Resurgence, it was noted that “No economist has done more to promote the revolutionary implications of information technology than MIT’s Erik Brynjolfsson”. Brynjolfsson was then professor at MIT’s Sloan School of Management, a role he held for 20 years, while also serving as director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy (IDE). During his two decades at MIT, Brynjolfsson distinguished himself as one of the world’s leading researchers on productivity and work, and on the economics of information, AI, and the digital economy. An economist by training, Brynjolfsson has focused on how AI drives productivity. When it comes to the business productivity implications of AI, who better to provide a perspective on the current state of AI and its potential to transform work.


I first met Erik Brynjolfsson during his tenure at MIT. At the time, I attended a number of IDE events, and Brynjolfsson joined me for one of a series of Fortune 1000 CIO roundtable tables that I organized and hosted during these years. When I published my book, Fail Fast, Learn Faster: Lessons in Data Driven Leadership in an Age of Disruption, Big Data, and AI, in 2021, I referenced Brynjolfsson’s pioneering work at the intersection of digital, data, and AI, which was years ahead of its time. In works such as 2016’s The Second Machine Age, co-authored with Andrew McAfee, and in a 2017 MIT Sloan Management Review article, “How to Thrive – and Survive – in a World of AI Disruption”, Brynjolfsson anticipated the impact that AI would have on work and business productivity.

In June 2020, during the COVID outbreak, Brynjolfsson was presented with the opportunity to relocate across the country to become the Jerry Yang and Akiko Yamazaki Professor and Senior Fellow with Stanford University in Palo Alto, and to launch the Digital Economy Lab at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI). The mission of the Digital Economy Lab is to improve our understanding of the economic implications of the rapid improvements in AI and other digital technologies. Led by Brynjolfsson, it includes faculty from multiple departments across Stanford. Research focuses on developing new economic models and empirical research, including measuring, forecasting and guiding the human and societal impact of AI, and particularly in ways that create widely shared prosperity.

I had the opportunity to catch up with Brynjolfsson in recent weeks. Brynjolfsson’s research examines the effects of not only AI but also other information technologies on business strategy, productivity and performance, and digital commerce. He believes that the impact of a changing economy will be felt by everyone, crossing boundaries of wealth, status, geography, and culture. Central to the mission of the Lab is a belief in the power of human work, and a belief that augmenting human capabilities with machine capabilities through AI will lead to beneficial gains for everyone. As Brynjolfsson noted as far back in 2017 “AI won’t replace managers, but managers who use AI will replace those who don’t.”

I asked Brynjolfsson how it felt to relocate to the West Coast and in close proximity to Silicon Valley. Brynjolfsson expressed deep love for MIT but added that it was invigorating to be near and a part of such a strong innovation community, both at Stanford and in Silicon Valley. I noted that I had recently had the opportunity to hear HAI director Fei-Fei Li speak at the Wall Street Journal Tech Live event in Laguna Beach and had written about that experience, and been inspired to read her memoir about her life in AI. HAI has assembled a strong leadership team and distinguished fellows, including the recent announcement that noted MIT researcher Sandy Pentland would be joining the HAI team as part of Brynjolfsson’s Digital Economy Lab.

Brynjolfsson recently participated in an extensive interview with the Financial Times, which appeared under the headline, “Erik Brynjolfsson: ‘This Could be The Best Decade in History – or the Worst”. I asked Brynjolfsson about his perspective on AI in the context of history, and where he would place AI among the pantheon of transformative technologies. “I think it’s most comparable to the Industrial Revolution” commented Brynjolfsson, noting however that, “while the Industrial Revolution played out over more than a century, AI will play out much faster, in a matter of a few decades”. AI is coming along “faster than anyone really expected” added Brynjolfsson, citing AI in healthcare as an area of great potential for human good.

I noted that in his Financial Times interview, Brynjolfsson had commented that people often use AGI – artificial general intelligence — as a synonym for human-level intelligence. However, “I think it will become apparent that humans have a narrow kind of intelligence and that truly general intelligence will have a much broader set of capabilities”. This was not something I commonly hear, so I asked Brynjolfsson to elaborate. This led to a discussion of augmentation, and how AI can and should be used to augment human skills and intelligence, which is at the heart of driving improved productivity. Brynjolfsson explained that technologists need to look at how AI can be used not just to “imitate or repeat human tasks”, but how AI can be used to “augment and complement” employees.

As an extension of his commitment to improving productivity, Brynjolfsson is embarking on a new business venture focused on “task-based analysis”, which refers to the concept of looking at tens of thousands of tasks and ranking them based on which tasks AI can help the most with. Brynjolfsson has launched a venture, Workhelix, which combines research and data to quantitatively assess a company’s GenAI opportunity. Workhelix co-founder and CEO James Milin explains, “The approach that we’ve pioneered starts with a granular question: can GenAI double the productivity of a task without reducing quality?” He continues, “Using our algorithms and data, we answer this question for every task in an organization, then work upward to understand how jobs, and ultimately each company, can benefit from GenAI”.
Brynjolfsson is a powerful advocate of the productivity potential that can be achieved through AI, envisioning double-digit gains in economic productivity, and commenting that he foresees the potential for “massive economic disruption” leading to the creation of new occupations and new companies in the coming years. Brynjolfsson believes this can lead to greater social benefits, manifested in the form of higher wages and greater prosperity. He expands upon this thesis in an article, The Turing Trap: The Promise and Peril of Human-Like Artificial Intelligence, noting that, “When AI is focused on augmenting humans rather than mimicking them, than humans retain the power to insist on a share of the value you created”. He adds, “Augmentation creates new capabilities and new products and services”.
As with any technology and period of historic transformation, responsibility ultimately resides with us as human beings. Brynjolfsson has argued that because we have more powerful tools than ever before “this could be the best decade in history – or the worst”, noting that “misinformation, viruses or weapons, cyber-attacks, and phishing attacks” remain threats. He points to risks posed by information overload, fake news, and other nefarious uses. Brynjolfsson concludes that the future of AI will largely depend on the steps we take today as humans to place a premium on intelligent governance, safeguards, and guardrails. Brynjolfsson warns us simply, “We should not fly blind.”

Generative artificial intelligence is poised to change how fashion works, but whether that’s good news or bad news might depend on what job you’re doing.
If you’re in control of budgets, AI offers opportunities to cut headcounts or reallocate resources more profitably. However, if you’re starting out in a career, AI could reduce opportunity, particularly in starter roles.
As tasks become faster and easier, brands see an opportunity to shift some manual tasks from humans to machines. First up for streamlining: human-led and often time-consuming roles, such as copywriting, coding, customer service, clienteling, photo editing and 3D design and illustration.
Brands are already utilising the power of AI to cut production and operations costs. In May, LVMH awarded its 2024 Innovation Award to Chinese startup FancyTech, a platform that is collaborating with LVMH brands. FancyTech uses generative artificial intelligence to produce videos from 3D product models and creative briefs. A separate prize went to Blng, an LA-based company that uses AI to convert sketches of jewellery into visualisations. Meanwhile, AI investment from the likes of LVMH-owned Sephora is focused on improving chatbots to supercharge the customer experience online.
The Estée Lauder Companies is using generative AI to measure customer sentiment, aid in writing copy and make product recommendations; a new innovation lab, with Microsoft, is developing tools that help internal teams identify and respond to trends, such as an internal chatbot that helps brands source products that identify specific problems. Revolve has tested it for generating new product designs, while Adore Me is enabling customers to customise their own bra and panty sets. Adore Me also uses generative AI to inform SEO-optimised product descriptions, but VP of strategy Ranjan Roy says that, ultimately, any copy customers end up seeing is approved and finalised by human employees.
AI provides opportunities in the fashion and retail sectors across multiple categories, according to Lamees Butt, CEO and founder of Riser, an AI-powered career matchmaking app for brands — “from the way trends are consumed and created to the retail customer journey”. It will “profoundly impact” the workforce, particularly in roles related to design, marketing and customer service, Butt says.
Some businesses have moved fast to maximise the opportunity. Swedish e-commerce payment company Klarna says AI has contributed to 37 per cent of its cost savings, equating to $10 million annually, for tasks related to external marketing, image production and general company efficiency.
A study from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), released in January, suggests that almost 40 per cent of employment worldwide is exposed to AI. Advanced economies are most exposed, while also being better positioned to leverage its benefits.
Roles such as retail specialists and store managers will “take the heat more than others”, says Adam Jackson, founder and CEO of AI recruiting app Braintrust, but he sees change everywhere. “AI is automating tasks like trend prediction, inventory management, and even churning out creative clothing patterns.”
Talented employees or applicants need not worry, he assures. “Many retailers are deploying AI to their advantage, focusing on hiring the right talent, as opposed to collecting the most résumés,” he says.
The ability to work with AI is becoming an essential skill to add to the average CV. Fashion job boards are introducing roles that require AI competency, such as data governance managers at LVMH or data scientists at Estée Lauder Companies — roles that require candidates to be comfortable with the “implementation of AI capabilities”.
Mindful implementation
As fashion and retail hurries to implement generative AI solutions, experts warn of the risks of moving too fast.
For all its potential, AI could prompt a knee-jerk response from overexcited business leaders. Partha Gopalakrishnan, president of Brane Group, a consultancy specialising in AI solutions, and a former senior executive at Infosys, has noted “a spate of layoffs, teething errors in retailers’ systems and even big firms ceasing working with creative agencies and freelancers”.
Gopalakrishnan is concerned that the human factor may be neglected by fashion executives prioritising quick-win opportunities. “Fashion and retail executives need to take a step back and rethink their approach. [The industry] needs to invest in talent, culture and training first, and then it can start to fold AI into its operations,” he says.
He suggests that retailers should be looking to employ “highly adaptable candidates” with the ability to unlearn and relearn, complemented by the introduction of comprehensive internal training and upskilling.
In the interim, some governments are stepping in to alleviate concerns around the impact. Last autumn, for example, the US Biden administration issued an executive order calling for support when it comes to job training, with hopes to mitigate job displacement.
Some companies, already in this mindset, have invested in training programmes to help employees gain AI and data analysis skills. Nike, for example, deploys AI-powered tools that provide its senior leadership team with access to custom analytics tailored to support decision-making. Tapestry-owned Coach has an internal dashboard that provides relevant data to all employees, enabling staff to understand trends and make more informed recommendations. German-based Hugo Boss has worked with external consultancy Metyis to build out what it describes as a “dedicated data science campus”.
Upskilling
Momentum is building in upskilling teams. Estée Lauder and Microsoft have collaborated on creating an AI innovation lab to upskill Estée Lauder employees. The company is able to use Microsoft’s tech expertise to develop in-house solutions that are specific to its business, and therefore didn’t require additional employees to build out these efforts.
Altava Group, a fashion-tech company that emerged from LVMH’s La Maison des Startups business accelerator, has launched a proprietary generative AI tool for accessible 3D fashion design. The business is upskilling its team and hiring employees with specific skill sets relating to machine learning and AI, says founder and CEO Andy Ku. “We are upskilling our team in distributed computing, blockchain and data learning — considering [the development of] our AI engine and our [new] target vertical, which includes 3D asset and item creation using data from our experience in luxury fashion use cases.”
Riser’s Butt advises brands to use AI tools that keep human connection and creativity — known to be key drivers of success — front of mind. “People and purpose are the most powerful parts of any brand,” says Butt. “The companies that will win are those open to embracing new solutions that blend technology with a human-centric approach, ensuring that AI enhances — rather than replaces — the unique value that only people can bring.”

Hearing the terms generative AI and ChatGPT sparks fear among many, raising concerns about job security and future relevance. This reaction is understandable, Never in our lifetimes has a technological disruption been this vast or swift. However, generative AI is also a solution to many workplace challenges, likely making us happier and more fulfilled.


At a recent press event, I heard this phrase: ""I love my work, and I hate my day."" This phrase captures the frustration many employees feel when bureaucracy and routine tasks overshadow the more fulfilling aspects of their jobs. For instance, if you are an HR Business Partner, a significant portion of your time might be spent answering repetitive questions like “How do I add a partner to my benefits?” or “What do I need to do to change my official name?” That leaves little room for higher-level, strategic work. Providing rote answers probably doesn’t keep you inspired at work. You likely enjoy building relationships with your internal clients or working strategically to build programs that drive engagement and bolster team cohesion. These monotonous activities consume much of the workday, limiting time for more meaningful and enjoyable tasks. As a result, your joy factor at work diminishes. AI can help.

The Role Of Generative AI
Generative AI tools like ChatGPT can alleviate this issue by speeding up or even eliminating the soul-sucking elements of your job. This, in turn, frees you up to focus on what you love doing. Research supports the positive impact of AI on workplace satisfaction, “Companies that have adopted AI technologies report a 40% increase in productivity,” according to a McKinsey report.

Generative AI Tools Can Enhance Workplace Happiness
No matter your role, there are ways AI can be used to increase your fulfilling-to-frustrating activity quotient.

Administrative Assistance
AI can handle repetitive administrative tasks, such as scheduling meetings, managing emails, organizing travel, and generating reports. This reduces the time you spend on mundane activities, allowing you to focus on more strategic tasks.

Implement AI Solutions
To leverage AI effectively and enhance your job satisfaction, follow these steps:


Get Clear on Your Tasks: Identify the tasks in your workday that diminish your enthusiasm. Determine which ones take up the most of your time.
Identify AI-Compatible Tasks: From your list, identify the tasks that could be accomplished by AI, either fully or partially.
Research Tools: Explore AI tools and solutions that can help you automate these tasks. This might involve experimenting with different AI platforms to find the best fit for your needs, talking to others in your field, or taking a course.
Implement: Starting with one routine task, create your plan for incorporating AI, then measure the impact. Once you have that process sorted, take on your next most monotonous task, and then the next.


Adopt generative AI tools like ChatGPT to streamline your workload, reduce monotony, and focus on what truly drives you. This not only enhances your job satisfaction but also bolsters your personal brand attribute of “change agent.” Embracing AI is not just about keeping up with technology; it's about creating a more enjoyable and meaningful work experience.

IRIS Software Group Unveils Generative AI, Chatbot and Automation Features for HR, Recruitment and Payroll ProfessionalsNew intelligent functionality in Networx, Cascade and Staffology platforms will help more than 3,600 businesses reduce time spent on manual processesFrom the CIPD Festival of Work tradeshow, IRIS Software Group (IRIS), a leading global software provider of accountancy, edtech, HR and payroll solutions, today announced the integration of new generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), chatbot and automation functionality within its Networx recruitment, Cascade HR and Staffology payroll platforms. Integrating these intelligent technologies will help more than 3,600 businesses streamline workflows, enhance productivity and operational efficiencies.
Building Job Descriptions with Generative AI
Recent research indicates 68% of organisations have increased their use of AI tools in the recruitment process. To help HR professionals and recruiters save time, IRIS has integrated new GenAI functionality into its recruitment software Networx – boosting productivity for more than 400 businesses.
First introduced as a trial in July 2023 and now generally available, HR and recruiting professionals can instantly build full job descriptions with GenAI by inputting the basic information for a role, such as job title, salary, location and company benefits. While human oversight, review and approval is still required, this feature helps remove the bulk of manual effort for HR professionals, freeing them up to focus on more high-level and strategic tasks.  
Enhancing User Experience with Chatbot Functionality 
In June 2024, IRIS unveiled ‘IRIS Cascade Assistant’, a new Chatbot feature. Powered by natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms, the Cascade chatbot is designed to understand employees' questions and retrieve answers from Cascade's Help Centre. The chatbot is available 24/7 and operates like a conversation, making it easy for users of all levels of technical expertise to engage effortlessly. Currently undergoing testing with a small group of customers, this chatbot feature will be available to more than 1,200 businesses in July.
Streamlining Payroll Management with Automatic Backpay Adjustments Feature
In October 2023, IRIS launched a new Staffology Payroll Automatic Backpay Adjustments feature, designed to help 2,000 businesses streamline payroll management. When this new feature is turned on, it automatically calculates back pay for any paylines.
	In addition, Staffology Payroll already offers existing automation features, such as:

Autopilot automatically finishes pay runs and starts new ones based on user preferences. Users can set and schedule this feature to run as early as six days before the payment date and select a preferred time for the send.

Auto Submit Full Payment Submission (FPS) automatically sends the required payment information to HMRC when a pay run is completed.

Auto Submit Journal posts a journal for each pay run if it’s connected to an accounting platform.

Auto Submit Payments triggers payment distribution when linked to a payment platform.

Auto Emails automatically sends summary emails and payslip copies to employees when a pay run is finalised, allowing customisation of recipients, content and attachments.
Stephanie Coward, Managing Director of Human Capital Management (HCM) at IRIS said, “These latest updates to Networx, Cascade and Staffology empower recruitment, HR and payroll professionals to streamline their day-to-day operations, reduce administrative workload, and achieve greater strategic impact. For many years, IRIS has thoughtfully, and responsibly, built intelligent technologies into our products to help teams spend less time on tedious and repetitive tasks. As always, we will continue to explore new AI technologies and partnerships -- while also ensuring human oversight and building appropriate guardrails into our processes.”
	In February 2024, IRIS became the first payment platform provider to integrate UNIPaaS’ AI Assist into IRIS Pay, an embedded payment solution within its software ecosystem. This partnership leverages generative AI to help prevent late invoice payments by recommending the most effective payment methods for each customer based on historical data.
	Today’s Networx, Cascade and Staffology features will be available for demonstration at IRIS' stand (D31) at the CIPD Festival of Work.

CIOs are growing cautious about hiring, but predictions that the rise of generative AI will have a rapid effect on jobs may have been over blown.While almost three-quarters of tech leaders have deployed generative AI, there’s no sign of it replacing workers – at least, not yet, according to a survey by recruiter Nash Squared. It found that 72% of the tech chiefs have deployed generative AI to at least some employees, with one-in-five deploying it enterprise-wide.Rolling out AI has been helped by the relative simplicity and low costs of generative AI productivity tools. Nash Squared said that, rather like the growth of cloud computing 10 years ago, much of the deployment has happened in the ‘shadows’ with users acquiring tools beyond the watchful eye of the IT department.The survey quoted one tech leader as saying part of the reason their company rolled out generative AI tools was to “stop people doing it themselves and to put proper governance in place”.LATEST VIDEOS FROM itproITProThe survey found nearly half (42%) of companies now have a generative AI policy – up from 21% in November last year – with a similar number planning to put one in place soon.However, Nash Squared warned that for many firms, this has been a “retrofit” after generative AI has been rolled out or adopted.“Those organizations that have a policy are equally as likely to be concerned over misuse of Ai as those that don’t, suggesting the policy is having a limited effect,” the report said.Get the ITPro. daily newsletterReceive our latest news, industry updates, featured resources and more.

Only one-in-ten have reported job roles changing, and just 1% are seeing jobs replaced.AI is creating at least one staffing change though, with the appointment of Chief AI Officers (CAIO). One-in-twenty organizations already have one, with a similar proportion planning to appoint one. However, for the majority of organizations, the AI strategy still sits with various senior tech leaders, the CIO, or CTO.Bev White, CEO of Nash Squared, said the report shows that the early warnings over widespread job losses as a result of generative AI haven’t yet materialized. This process will be gradual, he added.“Although the ’replace jobs’ impact of GenAI is headline grabbing news, in our discussions with tech leaders there is a sense that its impact will be evolutionary rather than revolutionary,” he said. “As organizations change and grow AI will be stitched into the operations and structure; its impact happening bit by bit.”The tech hiring outlook is still grimStill, if AI isn’t having an impact on jobs now, the outlook for hiring is less than rosy. The survey found that 43% of IT chiefs said they expected their overall tech budget would increase next year. That might seem positive, but it’s lower than the years from 2021 to 2023 which saw larger expected increases.More worrying for IT workers, tech chiefs are less likely than ever to expect to hire more staff. Only 36% of executives said they expect their technology headcount to increase over the next year (53% said it would stay the same and 11% expected it to drop).As Nash Squared pointed out, this is not only lower than its last report (36% versus 50%), it’s the lowest since it began measuring this factor.RELATED WHITEPAPER(Image credit: Proofpoint)Get insight into the risky behaviors of 7,500 end users“While tech investment seems to remain stable, digital leaders are looking to increase the impact of technology through technology itself (for instance in using AI for code development and customer support) and are currently cautious about adding people,"" the report said.It quoted one survey respondent who said “we want to grow our impact, not our headcount”.In a twist, organizations that have company-wide implementations of generative AI are actually more likely to be increasing tech headcount in the next year than the average (43 per cent versus 36 per cent), further complicating the relationship between AI and jobs.Two-thirds of digital leaders said the economy was holding them back at least to some extent; on the plus side, many thought the economy would return to ‘normal’ in six to nine months.“For many digital leaders the advent of GenAI marks a useful ‘pivot’ to refresh digital strategies – and budgets – as they look to the future,” the report said.

Are bigger language models always better?

  4 min read - As enterprises look to separate the hype from where AI can add true value, it’s unclear if increasingly larger language models will always lead to better business solutions.

Credit: IMFOpinion by Era Dabla-Norris, Ruud de Mooij (washington dc)Wednesday, June 19, 2024Inter Press ServiceWASHINGTON DC, Jun 19 (IPS)  - New generative-AI technologies hold immense potential for boosting productivity and improving the delivery of public services, but the sheer speed and scale of the transformation also raise concerns about job losses and greater inequality. Given uncertainty over the future of AI, governments should take an agile approach that prepares them for highly disruptive scenarios.A new IMF paper argues that fiscal policy has a major role to play in supporting a more equal distribution of gains and opportunities from generative-AI. But this will require significant upgrades to social-protection and tax systems around the world.How should social-protection policies be revamped in the face of disruptive technological changes from AI? While AI could eventually boost overall employment and wages, it could put large swaths of the labor force out of work for extended periods, making for a painful transition.Lessons from past automation waves and the IMF’s modeling suggest more generous unemployment insurance could cushion the negative impact of AI on workers, allowing displaced workers to find jobs that better match their skills. Most countries have considerable scope to broaden the coverage and generosity of unemployment insurance, improve portability of entitlements, and consider forms of wage insurance.At the same time, sector-based training, apprenticeships, and upskilling and reskilling programs could play a greater role in preparing workers for the jobs of the AI age. Comprehensive social-assistance programs will be needed for workers facing long-term unemployment or reduced local labor demand due to automation or industry closures.To be sure, there will be important differences in how AI impacts emerging-market and developing economies—and thus, how policymakers there should respond. While workers in such countries are less exposed to AI, they are also less protected by formal social-protection programs such as unemployment insurance because of larger informal sectors in their economies. Innovative approaches leveraging digital technologies can facilitate expanded coverage of social-assistance programs in these countries.Should AI be taxed to mitigate labor-market disruptions and pay for its effects on workers? In the face of similar concerns, some have recommended a robot tax to discourage firms from displacing workers with robots.Yet, a tax on AI is not advisable. Your AI chatbot or co-pilot wouldn’t be able to pay such a tax—only people can do that. A specific tax on AI might instead reduce the speed of investment and innovation, stifling productivity gains. It would also be hard to put into practice and, if ill-targeted, do more harm than good.So, what can be done to rebalance tax policy in the age of AI? In recent decades, some advanced countries have scaled up corporate tax breaks on software and computer hardware in an effort to drive innovation. However, these incentives also tend to encourage companies to replace workers through automation. Corporate tax systems that inefficiently favor the rapid displacement of human jobs should be reconsidered, given the risk that they could magnify the dislocations from AI.Many emerging market and developing countries tend to have corporate tax systems that discourage automation. That can be distortive in its own way, preventing the investments that would enable such countries to catch up in the new global AI economy.How should governments design redistributive taxation to offset rising inequality from AI? Generative-AI, like other types of innovation, can lead to higher income inequality and concentration of wealth. Taxes on capital income should thus be strengthened to protect the tax base against a further decline in labor’s share of income and to offset rising wealth inequality. This is crucial, as more investment in education and social spending to broaden the gains from AI will require more public revenue.Since the 1980s, the tax burden on capital income has steadily declined in advanced economies while the burden on labor income has climbed.To reverse this trend, strengthening corporate income taxes could help. The global minimum tax agreed by over 140 countries, which establishes a minimum 15-percent effective tax rate on multinational companies, is a step in the right direction. Other measures could include a supplemental tax on excess profits, stronger taxes on capital gains, and improved enforcement.The latest AI breakthroughs represent the fruit of years of investment in fundamental research, including through publicly funded programs. Similarly, decisions made now by policymakers will shape the evolution of AI for decades to come. The priority should be to ensure that applications broadly benefit society, leveraging AI to improve outcomes in areas such as education, health and government services. And given the global reach of this powerful new technology, it will be more important than ever for countries to work together.Fernanda Brollo, Daniel Garcia-Macia, Tibor Hanappi, Li Liu, and Anh Dinh Minh Nguyen also contributed to the staff discussion note on which this blog is based.Source: IMFIPS UN BureauFollow @IPSNewsUNBureauFollow IPS News UN Bureau on Instagram© Inter Press Service (2024) — All Rights ReservedOriginal source: Inter Press ServiceWhere next?

tl;dr
 Generative AI can 'hallucinate' when unsure of an answer, making up incorrect responses. Oxford researchers developed a statistical model to identify likely AI 'hallucinations.' This method distinguishes between AI uncertainty in content and expression, aiding reliability. 



Generative AI can have “hallucinations” when it doesn’t know the answer to a question; here’s how to spot it.
Researchers from the University of Oxford have devised a new method to help users work out when generative AI could be “hallucinating.” This comes about when an AI system is posed a query that it doesn’t know the answer to, causing it to make up an incorrect answer.
Luckily, there are tips to both spot this when it’s happening and prevent it from happening altogether.
How to stop AI hallucinations
A new study by the team at the University of Oxford has produced a statistical model that can identify when questions asked of generative AI chatbots were most likely to produce an incorrect answer.
This is a real concern for generative AI models, as the advanced nature of how they communicate means they can pass off false information as fact. That was highlighted when ChatGPT went rogue with false answers back in February.
With more and more people from all walks of life turning to AI tools to help them with school, work, and daily life, AI experts like those involved in this study are calling for clearer ways for people to tell when AI is making up responses, especially when related to serious topics like healthcare and the law.
The researchers at the University of Oxford claim that their research can tell the difference between when a model is correct or just making something up.
“LLMs are highly capable of saying the same thing in many different ways, which can make it difficult to tell when they are certain about an answer and when they are literally just making something up,” said study author Dr Sebastian Farquhar while speaking to the Evening Standard. “With previous approaches, it wasn’t possible to tell the difference between a model being uncertain about what to say versus being uncertain about how to say it. But our new method overcomes this.”
However, there is of course still more work to do on ironing out the errors AI models can make.
“Semantic uncertainty helps with specific reliability problems, but this is only part of the story,” he added. “If an LLM makes consistent mistakes, this new method won’t catch that. The most dangerous failures of AI come when a system does something bad but is confident and systematic.
“There is still a lot of work to do.”

Physics professor Richard Taylor, seen here with a painting of unknown origin, has been using computers to analyze the work of Jackson Pollock since the 1990s.

Artificial intelligence can spot art forgeries, study findsA team led by the UO’s Richard Taylor used Jackson Pollock paintings to train an AI programWith potential price tags of more than $100 million, Jackson Pollock’s abstract paintings have inspired countless imitators, igniting fierce debate whenever similar works of unknown origin are discovered. But a team led by a University of Oregon professor has developed an artificial intelligence tool that can help resolve these debates by authenticating Pollock’s paintings with 98.9 percent accuracy, giving art experts a new, science-backed method for detecting forgeries.They reported their findings this week in the journal PLOS ONE.“It’s almost like the American dream to find a Jackson Pollock painting in your attic,” said Richard Taylor, a UO College of Arts and Sciences physics professor and Pollock enthusiast. “After the initial excitement, how do you find out if it’s a long-lost master work or a compelling imitation? That’s where the machine now comes in.”  

 









An artificial intelligence tool developed by UO researchers can distinguish between Jackson Pollock and his imitators with 98.9 percent accuracy. 



 









The image on the left depicts a portion of “Blue Poles,” one of Pollock’s most famous works, while the one on the right shows an imitation.

Training computers to spot fractalsThe tool harnesses machine learning to recognize visual characteristics such as fractal patterns found in Pollock’s unique “poured” compositions. Machine learning is the ability of computer systems to learn patterns found in a training dataset and then make decisions without any additional programming. Fractals are naturally occurring patterns that repeat at increasingly small scales, visible in trees, clouds, snowflakes and coastlines.

 









UO physics professor Richard Taylor

​​​​​Pollock’s unusual technique of pouring out paint while walking around his canvas created similar patterns within his art, making it an ideal candidate for computer analysis, Taylor said.Julian Smith and Caleb Holt, both UO doctoral graduates, trained an artificial neural network to identify those patterns by feeding it images from Taylor’s personal collection of nearly 600 digitized artworks, the largest digital collection of Pollock paintings, imitations and other abstract works ever assembled, according to their study.But it takes thousands of images to train a neural network effectively. To overcome that challenge, Holt and Smith devised a novel machine learning strategy for image study, breaking each picture into smaller “tiles” at a variety of different scales. Because of their fractal nature, Pollock’s paintings are recognizable whether looking at the full artwork or just a small corner, Holt said. That made it possible for the machine learning program to identify the same patterns in each section of a painting as in the whole.“We could take an image of a Jackson Pollock painting and chop it up,” he said. “Now we could have 20,000 images, as many as we need to train a machine learning model reliably.”

 









Richard Taylor peeks underneath Jackson Pollock’s “One” at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, looking for telltale signs of authenticity.

The resulting tool, while highly accurate, functions as a “black box,” offering no visibility into how it arrives at its conclusions. The team conducted rigorous testing to determine not only whether it works but why it works, Smith said.“I can see that it’s providing a result, but I don’t really know what’s going into all of the little decisions being made,” he said. “The worry is that your AI is doing its job but for the wrong reasons. We found that it’s doing exactly what we thought it should.” “We could take an image of a Jackson Pollock painting and chop it up,” he said. “Now we could have 20,000 images, as many as we need to train a machine learning model reliably.”Caleb Holt, UO doctoral graduateBecause the tool can receive data and deliver results without human interference in its decision-making process, it has the potential to help end the Pollock-related fraud scandals that “come along routinely like trains” in the art world, Taylor said.“A lot of the controversy around art authentication is whether the humans involved are biased or have a motive,” he said. “We wanted to be able to feed things in with no human contamination.”But computers can't do it aloneThe researchers emphasize that their authentication technique is not intended to be used in isolation and won’t be putting any art experts out of a job. Rather, when coupled with other techniques such as materials analysis and visual inspection, AI can provide a scientific complement to human expertise.“Some of the greatest Pollock scholars sometimes get it wrong; the human eye gets it wrong,"" Taylor said. “If AI can help sort these cases out pretty quickly, we will be doing the whole art world a service. It’s a really beautiful opportunity for an art-science collaboration.”Taylor has been using computers to analyze Pollock’s art since the 1990s, when he realized the paintings contained the same fractal patterns he had been studying in nature, a style he dubbed “fractal expressionism.”“Pollock managed to distill the essence of nature and put it onto a canvas,” he said. ""I believe he would be absolutely amazed that a computer now studies his artworks and can separate his master works from imitations with remarkable accuracy.” But the AI tool isn't just for settling authenticity disputes. The researchers say their study provides scientific evidence that Pollock’s artistic signature is quantifiably different than that of other artists who mimic his poured paint technique, confirming that Pollock’s contributions to modern art go beyond merely popularizing the pouring technique.It also raises thought-provoking questions about whether artificial intelligence can appreciate art, Taylor added. “Our computer can spot a fake far more accurately than a human,” he said. “Is that a form of artistic appreciation? In a way, artificial intelligence does appreciate a Jackson Pollock painting.”Story by Nicole KruegerPhotos by Chris Larsen

As businesses increasingly adopt AI to improve efficiency, certain jobs are more vulnerable to automation. Here are five fields at risk from AI.Data Analysts and BookkeepersJobs that involve data analysis, bookkeeping, and basic financial reporting are highly susceptible to automation. These roles, which focus on repetitive administrative tasks, are prime candidates for AI-driven efficiency improvements.Read more: Best Accounting Software""When thinking about the implications for specific jobs, these tools are more likely to replace tasks than jobs, which may mean that you need fewer people to do the work or it could mean that more people are needed because the productivity is much higher with all the low value work is being done by machines,"" Carter Price, senior mathematician at the RAND Corporation think tank, told Newsweek.Customer Service RepresentativesThe customer service sector is already experiencing significant changes due to AI. Chatbots and AI-powered assistants are increasingly handling customer inquiries, reducing the need for human agents.According to a study by Gartner, by 2025, 80 percent of customer service and support organizations will be applying generative AI technology in some form.This trend is already visible, with companies like IBM and British telecommunications giant BT Group citing AI as a reason for job cuts&#8203;&#8203; and hiring slowdowns.""We have already seen the deployment of these technologies in customer service roles either as chatbots or as chatbots hooked up to text to voice systems,"" Price said.""An LLM can quickly search all the relevant manuals or other text documentation to find the relevant information.""However, this still is likely to need human supervision and complex cases will need to be handled by humans,"" he added.LLM stands for large language model&mdash;a type of AI algorithm capable of drawing on vast quantities of data to generate content.Media Content CreationAI's ability to read, write, and understand text-based data puts media jobs at risk, including roles in advertising, content creation, technical writing, and journalism.""LLMs, in their most basic form, have a tenuous relationship with the truth but are facile with written text,"" Price explained. ""The transformer, the core technology behind LLMs, was originally developed for machine translation back in 2017. However, transformers proved so effective with text generation that they are being used as generalized tools for examining and producing text, images, sounds, and other data forms.""The AI tools we interact with today have been augmented and are better with the truth but still make suggestions like eating rocks [...].""There is a lot of ongoing work to make these tools more reliable and we can expect significant improvements in the coming months and years,"" he added.Legal Assistants and ParalegalsThe legal industry is not immune to the impacts of AI. Roles such as paralegals and legal assistants, which involve consuming large amounts of information and synthesizing it into legal briefs or opinions, are particularly vulnerable.AI can replicate many of these tasks, although complete automation is unlikely due to the need for human judgment.""Many paralegal tasks require sifting through large data sets of text which is something that LLMs excel at. However, these jobs also require careful attention to language and accuracy [...]. Thus, it is very important for a human to oversee the work just as a senior attorney will review the work of a paralegal or associate,"" said Price.Financial AnalystsFinancial analysts and personal financial advisors are also at risk.

New York (CNN) — Corporate America is rapidly adopting artificial intelligence to automate work once exclusively done by humans.
Nearly half (46%) of large US firms plan to use AI within the next year to automate tasks previously done by employees, according to a survey of finance chiefs released Thursday.
Those tasks include everything from paying suppliers and doing invoices to financial reporting, said the survey conducted by Duke University and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.
That’s in addition to creative tasks for which some businesses are already relying on ChatGPT and other AI chatbots to assist, including crafting job posts, writing press releases and building marketing campaigns.
The findings show companies are increasingly turning to AI to cut costs, boost profits and make their workers more productive.
“You can’t be running an innovative company without seriously considering these technologies. You run the risk of being left behind,” Duke finance professor John Graham, academic director of the survey, told CNN in a phone interview.
The CFO Survey, a collaboration of Duke and the Atlanta Fed, found that nearly one in three (32%) firms — large or small — plan to use AI in the next year to complete tasks once done by humans.
Why bosses are deploying AI
Some of this is already happening — especially among larger firms that have the financial firepower to experiment with AI.
Nearly 60% of all companies (and 84% of large companies) surveyed said that over the past year they have already leaned on software, equipment or technology including AI to automate tasks employees previously did. The survey was conducted between May 13 and June 3.
Bosses are turning to AI for a variety of reasons, including to trim what they are spending on human workers.
The CFO Survey found that companies say they are using automation to increase product quality (58% of firms); increase output (49%), reduce labor costs (47%) and substitute for workers (33%).
Still, the good news for workers is that some experts don’t believe AI will cause mass job loss, at least not right away.
“I don’t think there will be a lot of job loss in the year,” said Graham. “In the short run, this will be more about plugging some holes and possibly not hiring someone they would have otherwise — but not laying someone off. In part that’s because this is all-brand new.”
AI co-pilots on the way?
Yet workers will feel the impact of AI adoption, if they aren’t already.
“This could give humans more time to prioritize what is most important and rewarding,” said Graham.
Reid Hoffman, the billionaire investor and co-founder of LinkedIn, told CNN that AI will likely disrupt some jobs but not in the immediate future.
“Years, not decades, but years, not months,” Hoffman said, referring to the timing of AI displacing humans. “I believe in three to five years, we’ll all have kind of an agent co-pilot that’s helping us with anything from how we cook dinner…to doing your job and writing and so forth.”
Hoffman, who last year wrote a book called “Impromptu: Amplifying Our Humanity Through AI” with the assistance from ChatGPT-4, stressed that for a number of years it will be a co-pilot, not a pilot.
“It’s job transformation. Human jobs will be replaced — but will be replaced by other humans using AI,” he said. “The whole ideas is to be the human who is using AI, to learn it, to do it, to make it happen.”
AI and inflation
For now, bosses and employees remain concerned about the cost of living and inflationary pressures.
The CFO Survey found that inflation is the No. 2 concern for the next year among US chief financial officers – behind only the related concern of interest rates and monetary policy.
Most CFOs (57%) expect the price of their products to increase this year at a faster-than-normal pace.
However, there was a divergence in the inflation outlook based on technological adoption. The survey found that companies that implemented automation over the past 12 months expect slower price hikes than those that hadn’t.
Graham, the Duke professor, said that AI could eventually help moderate price increases but isn’t optimistic it will be a major force to easing inflation right now.
“It doesn’t feel like it will be the cure in the next year,” he said.
‘Significant risks’
The CFO survey shows how fast companies are turning to AI — even as safeguards and regulatory frameworks are still being cobbled together.
The rapid adoption of AI in some industries like finance has concerned some.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned in a speech earlier this month that the use of AI by financial companies poses both “tremendous opportunities and significant risks.”
A report issued last week by Democratic Sen. Gary Peters, chairman of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, found that exiting regulation “insufficiently addresses” how hedge funds are already using AI.
The report warned that there are “no regulations or requirements” mandating “when and whether a human must be involved in decision making, including related to trading decisions.”
Graham, the Duke professor, said it would be wise for companies in all industries to have strong risk management systems and redundancies in place as they experiment with AI.
“There has been rapid adoption of AI,” he said. “I hope it’s being done with a grain of salt. There will be some situations where companies have embarrassing products or supply chain situations because they moved a little too fast.”

See our ethics statement. Illustration by Alex Castro / The VergeFor the past couple of weeks, Adobe has faced intense backlash over changes to its terms of service agreement — and now, it’s trying to patch things up. On Tuesday, Adobe announced a tweaked version of its terms of service agreement that makes it clear the company will not train AI on user content stored locally or in the cloud.The section defining Adobe’s access to user content now includes several distinct categories, including one dedicated to generative AI. Adobe’s updated terms explicitly state that its software “will not use your Local or Cloud Content to train generative AI.” But there’s one exception: if your work is submitted to the Adobe Stock marketplace, the company can use it to train Adobe Firefly.These additions to the terms of service, according to Scott Belsky, Adobe’s chief strategy officer, aren’t actually changing anything — Adobe says its stance on AI training just wasn’t clearly laid out before, leading to confusion. “We’ve explicitly said we will not train generative AI on your content,” Belsky said during an interview with The Verge. “It was always a policy that we had as a company. We always made that very clear, but we never explicitly said that.”RelatedUS sues Adobe for ‘deceiving’ subscriptions that are too hard to cancel Adobe’s new terms of service aren’t the problem — it’s the trustThe new terms also address user concerns about Adobe scanning content created under a nondisclosure agreement (NDA), saying the company does not “scan or review” work stored locally on your device. Adobe will only automatically scan content uploaded to the cloud to “ensure we are not hosting illegal or abusive content, like Child Sexual Abuse Material.” It will also only subject work uploaded to the cloud to human review if it’s flagged or reported as illegal, or if you opt in to a prerelease, beta, or Adobe’s product improvement program.Adobe’s changes to its terms of service agreement sparked an uproar earlier this month after users misread changes as giving the company permission to use their work for AI training. The outcry stemmed from creatives who have grown frustrated with the company’s outsize grasp on the creative industry. Even the federal government has taken notice of users’ complaints about Adobe, as the Department of Justice is suing the company for allegedly hiding expensive cancellation fees and making it difficult to cancel their subscriptions.A lot of user frustration dates back to Adobe’s shift to a subscription-only model in 2012, something Belsky acknowledged as a point of contention. “I think that that was a change for some customers that probably rubbed them negatively,” Belsky said. “I think that when something like this [the terms of service update] happens, my observation is that we see a bit of a resurgence of that frustration. That may have been seeded back when we made that model change.”It’s great that Adobe’s tweaking its terms of service to make them more transparent, but this may just serve as a small patch on top of a much larger wound that will likely take more time — and close attention — to heal.Comments6 Comments / 6 NewFeatured Videos From The VergeFinal Cut Pro 2 on M4 iPad Pro: what you need to know

This did not go down well with many users, who criticized Apple for intentionally restricting Apple Intelligence to newer devices to increase sales. However, Apple has now clarified why the set of AI features, as part of Apple Intelligence, is limited to newer devices. John Giannandrea, Apple’s AI chief, blames the computational power required to run large language models on the device as the reason why Apple Intelligence is limited to the iPhone 15 Pro and Macs and iPads with M-series chips. “The inference of large language models is incredibly computationally expensive. So it’s a combination of bandwidth in the device, the size of the ANE [Apple Intelligence Neural Engine], and the oomph in the device to actually run these models fast enough to be useful,"" Giannandrea said during John Gruber’s The Talk Show. “You could, in theory, run these models on a very old device, but it would be so slow it would not be useful,” he further added. Apple Intelligence, Cupertino’s implementation of artificial intelligence, isn’t an app or a chatbot like ChatGPT. Rather, it’s an integrated layer of artificial intelligence embedded in Apple’s newer versions of operating systems. Apple Intelligence is essentially a flavor of AI, and it runs natively on your iPhone or Mac. Because it runs on-device, it requires a lot of processing power, which is why only select Apple devices can run it. While many Apple users find it disappointing, the truth is they need to upgrade to the latest Apple devices—either the iPhone 15 Pro or an iPad with the newer M-series chip—to meet the requirements needed to run Apple Intelligence. This means an older iPhone 14 Pro Max or iPhone 15 won’t support it.  Apple Intelligence’s AI features include an all-new Siri, AI-assisted writing tools, real-time call transcripts, and the ability to create unique emojis, among many other things. Analysts hope this approach could spur device upgrades, as Apple has lately seen sluggish iPhone, Mac, and iPad sales. But Apple doesn’t think Apple Intelligence is some sort of scheme to increase iPhone sales. “Otherwise, we would have been smart enough just to do recent iPads and Macs, too,” replied Greg Joswiak, Apple’s marketing head, debunking theories around selling more Apple devices by intentionally limiting Apple Intelligence to newer devices. However, the bigger question is whether the standard iPhone 16, due for launch later this fall, will get Apple Intelligence, or if users will need a pro model to use the full suite of AI features.

Rene Bystron spent hundreds of hours at his last startup building an app that helps teach people how to use generative AI tools. And it was through that experience that the Seattle entrepreneur came to a realization. 
“There’s this massive need in the market for a tool that allows people to leverage AI for workflow-specific tasks without prompting,” Bystron told GeekWire. 
Bystron is the co-founder and CEO of DeltaGen, a new Seattle-based startup developing software that aims to help companies use AI tools that don’t require “prompting,” or the process of queuing AI systems for a specific answer.
Bystron previously launched and led AI LaMo, which built games, quizzes, and other interactive content to teach people how to improve their prompt engineering skills and interact with chatbots such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Google’s Gemini.
“I’m cannibalizing years of work — I built my career in prompting,” Bystron said. “But I’ve just seen hundreds of companies and done dozens of generative AI workshops to know that this doesn’t come to people naturally.”
DeltaGen is building a platform targeted at enterprise workflows, starting with financial professionals. Its tool identifies workflows associated with a particular job by scanning LinkedIn profiles of users, and then provides solutions designed for specific tasks. 
“You don’t really need to write anything,” Bystron said. “You select and choose.”





Bystron said the software leverages around 30 APIs from different AI models and picks the best one for a particular job. 
“There are models that work better for some workflows, and others that work better for others,” he said.
DeltaGen is still in beta mode. It plans to generate revenue using a traditional software-as-a-service model, charging users for premium features.
The 5-person company recently joined the latest cohort of the Techstars Workforce Development Accelerator, a Denver, Colo.-based program designed for tech startups addressing labor market challenges. Another Seattle startup, Incskill, is also participating in the three-month program. 
Techstars earlier this year shut down its Seattle accelerator. 
Bystron previously was a project leader at Boston Consulting Group, and founded and led Meltingpot Forum, a large multidisciplinary speaker event in the Czech Republic.
DeltaGen co-founder and CTO Avinash Uddaraju previously co-founded Gritly, which also participated in Techstars’ workforce accelerator and was acquired by IIA Healthcare. Other co-founders at DeltaGen include CMO Abdullah Raja and COO Casey McCullar.

IMF proposes tax on AI carbon emissions to counter job loss, income inequality
A carbon tax could also curb AI's environmental toll

Serving tech enthusiasts for over 25 years.

Why it matters: Generative AI has emerged as a powerful but disruptive new technology, already bringing major changes to how many people work – and causing job losses for many others. Now, the International Monetary Fund believes that those job losses may hamper tax collections, so something has to give. One of their proposals to compensate is a carbon tax on the energy-intensive server farms powering these AI systems. 
This idea was floated in an IMF discussion paper titled ""Broadening the Gains from Generative AI: The Role of Fiscal Policies."" The paper's core argument is that while generative AI can be a huge productivity booster, it also risks widening inequality and hitting government coffers hard as jobs get automated.
Traditional automation tended to replace routine, lower-skilled jobs. Generative AI's cognitive capabilities mean it could start making inroads into fields like computer programming, accounting, and many other white-collar roles we thought were safe – ""potentially amplifying job losses in cognitive occupations,"" according to the paper. Fewer workers means less income tax revenue for governments.
Therefore, the IMF thinks that fiscal policies need to adapt. One suggestion is rethinking how we tax capital versus labor income. Capital (think machines, software, etc.) is often taxed less than labor, but if AI is letting capital replace human workers en masse, that balance may need rejigging.

They also raised concerns about ""winner-take-all"" markets dominated by a few mega-firms that can afford the massive computing costs of developing cutting-edge AI systems.

A carbon tax on those energy-hungry AI server farms could help level that playing field a little. ""Given the large amount of energy consumed by AI servers, taxing the associated carbon emissions is a good way to reflect the external environmental costs in the price of the technology,"" noted the IMF.
After all, AI is a real energy hog. Last year, research from AI startup Hugging Face and Carnegie Mellon University showed that generating a single AI image can eat up as much power as recharging a smartphone. Text generation is far more efficient, but is still no slouch in the electricity department. An AI tax based on their emissions could encourage more efficient practices.
The IMF stopped short of advocating a blanket ""AI tax"" since that could hamper innovation and adoption in countries that implement it, causing them to fall behind competition. But they did muse that AI could help upgrade old tax bureaucracies, allowing concepts like real-time property taxes based on market values.
""Gen AI will turn classic tax theory upside down and urge a rethink of the old ways of doing things. It may, for instance, usher in the design of a personalized progressive value-added tax, an income tax based on lifetime income, or a real-time market-value-based property tax.""
Of course, these proposals are more about preparing for various scenarios than concrete recommendations.
The potential job impacts are staggering. Earlier projections from the IMF estimated AI could affect nearly 40% of global jobs, rising to around 60% for rich countries. Whether that means humans being displaced or simply working alongside AI assistants remains to be seen.

California Takes Action to Protect Job ApplicantsKhari Johnson, CalMattersJun 20Save ArticleSave ArticleFailed to save articlePlease try againEmail (Adriana Heldiz/CalMatters; iStock)California regulators are moving to restrict how employers can use artificial intelligence to screen workers and job applicants — warning that using AI to measure tone of voice, facial expressions and reaction times may run afoul of the law.
The draft regulations say that if companies use automated systems to limit or prioritize applicants based on pregnancy, national origin, religion or criminal history, that’s discrimination.
Members of the public have until July 18 to comment on the proposed rules. After that, regulators in the California Civil Rights Department may amend and will eventually approve them, subject to final review by an administrative law judge, capping off a process that began three years ago.
The rules govern so-called “automated decision systems” — artificial intelligence and other computerized processes, including quizzes, games, resume screening, and even advertising placement. The regulations say using such systems to analyze physical characteristics or reaction times may constitute illegal discrimination. The systems may not be used at all, the new rules say, if they have an “adverse impact” on candidates based on certain protected characteristics.
The draft rules also require companies that sell predictive services to employers to keep records for four years in order to respond to discrimination claims.

A crackdown is necessary in part because while businesses want to automate parts of the hiring process, “this new technology can obscure responsibility and make it harder to discern who’s responsible when a person is subjected to discriminatory decision-making,” said Ken Wang, a policy associate with the California Employment Lawyers Association.
The draft regulations make it clear that third-party service providers are agents of the employer and hold employers responsible.
The California Civil Rights Department started exploring how algorithms, a type of automated decision system, can impact job opportunities and automate discrimination in the workplace in April 2021. Back then, Autistic People of Color Fund founder Lydia X. Z. Brown warned the agency about the harm that hiring algorithms can inflict on people with disabilities. Brown told CalMatters that whether the new draft rules offer meaningful protection depends on how they’re implemented and enforced.
Researchers, advocates and journalists have amassed a body of evidence that AI models can automate discrimination, including in the workplace. Last month, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission alleging that resume screening software made by the company Aon discriminates against people based on race and disability despite the company’s claim that its AI is “bias-free.” An evaluation of leading artificial intelligence firm OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 technology found that the large language model can exhibit racial bias when used to automatically sift through the resumes of job applicants. Though the company uses filters to prevent the language model from producing toxic language, internal tests of GPT-3 also surfaced race, gender, and religious bias.

Wearing glasses or a headscarf or having a bookshelf in the background of a video job interview can skew personality predictions, according to an investigative report by German public broadcast station Bayerischer Rundfunk. So can the font a job applicant chooses when submitting a resume, according to researchers at New York University.
California’s proposed regulations are the latest in a series of initiatives to protect workers from businesses using harmful forms of AI.
In 2021, New York City lawmakers passed a law to protect job applicants from algorithmic discrimination in hiring, although researchers from Cornell University and Consumer Reports recently concluded that the law has been ineffective. And in 2022, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the U.S. Justice Department clarified that employers must comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act when using automation during hiring.
The California Privacy Protection Agency, meanwhile, is considering draft rules that, among other things, define what information employers can collect on contractors, job applicants, and workers, allowing them to see what data employers collect and to opt out from such collection or request human review.
Pending legislation would further empower the source of the draft revisions, the California Civil Rights Department. Assembly Bill 2930 would allow the department to demand impact assessments from businesses and state agencies that use AI in order to protect against automated discrimination.

Outside of government, union leaders now increasingly argue that rank-and-file workers should be able to weigh in on the effectiveness and harms of AI in order to protect the public. Labor representatives have had conversations with California officials about specific projects as they experiment with how to use AI.

Google, University of Tokyo to launch AI project to solve regional issues


June 19, 2024 (Mainichi Japan)






















Google LLC announces it will launch an initiative that uses generative artificial intelligence to address challenges faced by local communities in Tokyo on June 19, 2024. (Kyodo)



    TOKYO (Kyodo) -- Google LLC said Wednesday it will collaborate with the University of Tokyo to launch an initiative that uses generative artificial intelligence to address challenges faced by local communities in Japan, such as a shrinking workforce, with successful models to be rolled out nationwide by 2027.







    Yutaka Matsuo, a professor at the university known for being a leading figure in AI research, will be involved in the project, which will first be piloted in Osaka and Hiroshima prefectures, Google said at a technology conference in Tokyo.




    Students who have completed courses in Matsuo's laboratory will work with Google engineers to construct generative AI models to solve specific issues.




    In Osaka, the focus will be on resolving employment mismatches due to skews in the types of professions that job seekers prefer. A successful model, for example, would be able to suggest positions that job seekers themselves may not have realized were suitable, or illustrate ideal career paths leading to a desired job.




    Unlike existing job placement agencies like Hello Work, proposals will be drawn from the vast data available online.




    The focus for Hiroshima remains to be decided. Gov. Hidehiko Yuzaki, who spoke at the conference, stated his intention to ""declare a future paved by AI,"" suggesting that the technology may be able to generate precise responses to inquiries about relocating.




    According to Google, generative AI could potentially be used to enhance medical care systems on remote islands and automate tasks in agriculture, forestry, and fisheries.




    ""Effectively (utilizing generative AI) could be a significant opportunity for Japan,"" Matsuo said.

Daniel says he has used ChatGPT in his studies.(BTN High: Lincoln Rothall)Schools and universities have been scrambling to keep up since ChatGPT and other generative AI language programs were released in late 2022.University student Lan Lang, 18, said quite a few people used generative AI for assessments such as English assignments.""I do get Chat to like explain stuff to me if teachers don't really explain it that well,"" Lan Lang said. Sam and Lan Lang say generative Al can be a helpful tool for students.(BTN High: Lincoln Rothall)She said she used AI detection software on her work.""We put it through Turnitin, which just basically detects if you've used AI, or if you've copied off anyone else's work,"" she said.Caught out in schoolsHigh school teacher Ryan Miller said he wasn't seeing a lot of generative AI used in the Year 12 and Year 8 classes he taught but understood from colleagues other age groups were using it. Ryan Miller says students get a warning when caught using AI for assignments.(Supplied: Ryan Miller)""What I hear, when I'm in the staff room, is that a lot of Year 9s, 10s, [and] 11s are pushing the boundaries,"" Mr Miller said.He said Year 12 students tended to be more careful after being warned at the start of the year and constantly reminded of consequences.""Basically, they're told if their work is seen to be made ... predominantly with AI, that it won't be assessed,"" he said.Mr Miller said Year 8s, being a little newer to the school, hadn't used it as much.He said teachers tended to give students a warning if they were detected using generative AI.""And nine times out of 10 they'll probably own up to it and say, 'Yeah, look, it wasn't ... 100 per cent my own work',"" he said. He said students would rewrite the work so it could be assessed again.""But it's sort of a one warning per kid, per year for most teachers, I think,"" he said.Fellow teacher Hugh Kinnane said generative AI was probably ""pretty rife"" in assignment work.He said he most regularly saw it cropping up with students who were trying to avoid doing any work.""And then it's a last-minute job,"" he said. Jennie Shaw says her university has embraced the use of artificial intelligence.(BTN High: Lincoln Rothall)Drawing the lineUniversity of Adelaide Deputy Vice-Chancellor Academic Jennie Shaw said while her university embraced the use of AI, it could still be used to cheat.Is it art if it's by AI? Brisbane Portrait Prize committee accused of jumping on 'slippery slope'The Brisbane Portrait Prize will allow AI artworks for the first time in this year's competition in a move that has left some in the industry ""uneasy"".Read more""So we're saying, of course, that is not allowed,"" Dr Shaw said.She said generative AI was included in academic integrity modules for first-year students.""We make it really clear to students what is OK and what is not OK,"" she said.Dr Shaw said there were instances when students were encouraged to use generative AI and then critique the quality of its answer.""What we are asking our students and our staff to do is to reference when they do use it,"" she said.She said it was a requirement that as much content as possible was checked by similarity detection software.According to Turnitin's website — which is used by the University of Adelaide as well as many other universities across Australia to detect AI-generated content— the company is committed to a false positive rate of less than 1 per cent to ensure not students are falsely accused of misconduct.AI arms raceThe software has put students at the centre of a battle for superiority between programs generating answers for their assignments and those designed to catch them out.And according to Australian Institute for Machine Learning senior lecturer Feras Dayoub, some are getting caught in the crossfire. Feras Dayoub says AI detection tools are not 100 per cent accurate.(BTN High: Cale Matthews)He said companies that created AI chatbots were trying to be undetectable while companies that created AI detection software wanted to detect everything.""There will be a lot of false positives,"" Dr Dayoub said.He said it could be an unpleasant experience for the student if the detector was wrong. Students Ethan (left) and Nicholas say they have noticed issues with AI-detecting programs.(BTN High: Lincoln Rothall)University student Ethan, 19, said single words were sometimes highlighted in his Turnitin submissions.""It can be a bit inaccurate,"" Ethan said.Dr Shaw said she understood the detection software had its faults.""We would find probably two thirds of anything they pick up saying there's some unacceptably high levels of similarity here is often just picking up patterns in language,"" she said.""I know some universities have chosen to turn it off because it does turn up lots of false positives.""We're choosing to use it at this point.""Changing educationThe Department of Education released a nationwide framework in December last year for the use of generative AI in schools.Subscribe to the BTN NewsletterDo you want to be notified when the next BTN High stories arrive?

In a groundbreaking revelation, a global survey by business automation company UiPath found that Singaporean Millennials and Gen Z workers lead the world in using generative AI tools at work. This survey involved 9,047 full-time employees from nine countries and highlights how these young Singaporean workers leverage AI to save time and increase productivity compared to older generations.
Generative AI adoption among younger workers
Singapore's younger workers enthusiastically embrace generative AI to tackle various work-related tasks. The survey indicates that 60% of local employees have used these tools during work hours. Typical uses include drafting communications (44%), summarising long-form content (34%), and brainstorming ideas (34%). These applications demonstrate the versatility and efficiency of generative AI in everyday work scenarios.
Battling burnout with AI
Amidst harsh economic conditions, Singaporean workers are experiencing heavier workloads, leading to increased stress and burnout. Nearly a third (30%) of employees in Singapore reported feeling extremely or very burned out. To combat this, workers are seeking ways to reduce their workloads (62%), have more time and capacity to complete tasks (46%), and gain access to AI and automation tools, including generative AI (43%).
Generative AI is viewed as a promising solution to alleviate burnout by giving employees more time to focus on critical tasks. The survey reveals that 62% of Singaporean workers who use generative AI believe it has saved them significant time, with over 42% reporting savings of 10 or more hours per week.
Expert insights and government initiatives
Jess O'Reilly, Area Vice President of Asia at UiPath, emphasised the positive impact of generative AI and automation on productivity and work-life balance. She stated, “The findings from our survey indicate that Singaporean workers who utilise both technologies have seen greater productivity and an improved work-life balance. To foster a more fulfilled workforce, initiatives to plug skill gaps, foster greater trust in AI, and establish strategic private-public partnerships will be key to helping workers embrace digital transformation in the age of AI.”
The survey results align with the Singapore government's efforts to promote AI adoption. In collaboration with partners like DataRobot, IBM, Singtel, and Temasek, the government launched Project Moonshot. This initiative provides a testing toolkit designed to address the security and safety challenges associated with large language models (LLMs), which are fundamental to many AI-driven solutions. Project Moonshot aims to ensure that AI technologies are implemented securely and effectively, supporting the broader digital transformation of Singapore's workforce.
In summary, the UiPath survey underscores the significant role of generative AI in enhancing productivity and reducing burnout among Singaporean workers. With continued government and private sector support, Singapore is well-positioned to lead the global digital transformation landscape.
