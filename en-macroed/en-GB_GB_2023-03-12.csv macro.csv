The software allowed users to enter a simple description of an image they had in their mind and, after a brief pause, the software would produce an almost uncannily good interpretation of their suggestion, worthy of a jobbing illustrator or Adobe-proficient designer – but much faster, and for free. Typing in, for example, “a pig with wings flying over the moon, illustrated by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry” resulted, after a minute or two of processing, in something reminiscent of the patchy but recognisable watercolour brushes of the creator of The Little Prince.A year or so later, when the software got a wider release, the internet went wild. Social media was flooded with all sorts of bizarre and wondrous creations, an exuberant hodgepodge of fantasies and artistic styles. And a few months later it happened again, this time with language, and a product called ChatGPT, also produced by OpenAI. Ask ChatGPT to produce a summary of the Book of Job in the style of the poet Allen Ginsberg and it would come up with a reasonable attempt in a few seconds. Ask it to render Ginsberg’s poem Howl in the form of a management consultant’s slide deck presentation and it would do that too. The abilities of these programs to conjure up strange new worlds in words and pictures alike entranced the public, and the desire to have a go oneself produced a growing literature on the ins and outs of making the best use of these tools, and particularly how to structure inputs to get the most interesting outcomes.The latter skill has become known as “prompt engineering”: the technique of framing one’s instructions in terms most clearly understood by the system, so it returns the results that most closely match expectations – or perhaps exceed them. Tech commentators were quick to predict that prompt engineering would become a sought-after and well remunerated job description in a “no code” future, where the most powerful way of interacting with intelligent systems would be through the medium of human language. No longer would we need to know how to draw, or how to write computer code: we would simply whisper our desires to the machine and it would do the rest. The limits on AI’s creations would be the limits of our own imaginations.View image in fullscreenAI art created by Dall-E as a result of inputting ‘a pig with wings flying over the moon, painted by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’. Photograph: Dall-E/CraiyonImitators of and advances on Dall-E followed quickly. Dall-E mini (later renamed Craiyon) gave those not invited to OpenAI’s private services a chance to play around with a similar, less powerful, but still highly impressive tool. Meanwhile, the independent commercial effort Midjourney and the open-source Stable Diffusion used a different approach to classifying and generating images, to much the same ends. Within a few months, the field had rapidly advanced to the generation of short videos and 3D models, with new tools appearing daily from academic departments and hobbyist programmers, as well as the established giants of social media and now AI: Facebook (aka Meta), Google, Microsoft and others. A new field of research, software and contestation had opened up.The name Dall-E combines the robot protagonist of Disney’s Wall-E with the Spanish surrealist artist Salvador Dalí. On the one hand, you have the figure of a plucky, autonomous and adorable little machine sweeping up the debris of a collapsed human civilisation, and on the other a man whose most repeated bon mots include, “Those who do not want to imitate anything, produce nothing,” and “What is important is to spread confusion, not eliminate it.” Both make admirable namesakes for the broad swathe of tools that have come to be known as AI image generators.In the past year, this new wave of consumer AI, which includes both image generation and tools such as ChatGPT, has captured the popular imagination. It has also provided a boost to the fortunes of major technology companies who have, despite much effort, failed to convince most of us that either blockchain or virtual reality (“the metaverse”) are the future that any of us want. At least this one feels fun, for five minutes or so; and “AI” still has that sparkly, science-fiction quality, redolent of giant robots and superhuman brains, which provides that little contact high with the genuinely novel. What’s going on under the hood, of course, is far from new.The fundamental concepts of academic artificial intelligence have not changed in the last couple of decades. The underlying technology of neural networks – a method of machine learning based on the way physical brains function – was theorised and even put into practice back in the 1990s. You could use them to generate images then, too, but they were mostly formless abstractions, blobs of colour with little emotional or aesthetic resonance. The first convincing AI chatbots date back even further. In 1964, Joseph Weizenbaum, a computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, developed a chatbot called Eliza. Eliza was modelled on a “person-centred” psychotherapist: whatever you said, it would mirror back to you. If you said “I feel sad”, Eliza would respond with “Why do you feel sad?”, and so on. (Weizenbaum actually wanted his project to demonstrate the superficiality of human communication, not to be a blueprint for future products.)Early AIs didn’t know much about the world, and academic departments lacked the computing power to exploit them at scale. The difference today is not intelligence, but data and power. The big tech companies have spent 20 years harvesting vast amounts of data from culture and everyday life, and building vast, energy-hungry data centres filled with ever more powerful computers to churn through it. What were once creaky old neural networks have become super-powered, and the gush of AI we’re seeing is the result.AI image generation relies on the assembly and analysis of millions upon millions of tagged images; that is, images that come with some kind of description of their content already attached. These images and descriptions are then processed through neural networks that learn to associate particular and deeply nuanced qualities of the image – shapes, colours, compositions – with certain words and phrases. These qualities are then layered on top of one another to produce new arrangements of shape, colour and composition, based on the billions of differently weighted associations produced by a simple prompt. But where did all those original images come from?The datasets released by LAION, a German non-profit, are a good example of the kind of image-text collections used to train large AI models (they provided the basis for both Stable Diffusion and Google’s Imagen, among others). For more than a decade, another non-profit web organisation, Common Crawl, has been indexing and storing as much of the public world wide web as it can access, filing away as many as 3bn pages every month. Researchers at LAION took a chunk of the Common Crawl data and pulled out every image with an “alt” tag, a line or so of text meant to be used to describe images on web pages. After some trimming, links to the original images and the text describing them are released in vast collections: LAION-5B, released in March 2022, contains more than five billion text-image pairs. These images are “public” images in the broadest sense: any image ever published on the internet may be gathered up into them, with exactly the kind of strange effects one may expect.In September 2022, a San Francisco–based digital artist named Lapine was using a tool called Have I Been Trained, which allows artists to see if their work is being used to train AI image generation models. Have I Been Trained was created by the artists Mat Dryhurst and Holly Herndon, whose own work led them to explore the ways in which artists’ labour is coopted by AI. When Lapine used it to scan the LAION database, she found an image of her own face. She was able to trace this image back to photographs taken by a doctor when she was undergoing treatment for a rare genetic condition. The photographs were taken as part of her clinical documentation, and she signed documents that restricted their use to her medical file alone. The doctor involved died in 2018. Somehow, these private medical images ended up online, then in Common Crawl’s archive and LAION’s dataset, and were finally ingested into the neural networks as they learned about the meaning of images, and how to make new ones. For all we know, the mottled pink texture of our Saint-Exupéry-style piggy could have been blended, however subtly, from the raw flesh of a cancer patient.“It’s the digital equivalent of receiving stolen property. Someone stole the image from my deceased doctor’s files and it ended up somewhere online, and then it was scraped into this dataset,” Lapine told the website Ars Technica. “It’s bad enough to have a photo leaked, but now it’s part of a product. And this goes for anyone’s photos, medical record or not. And the future abuse potential is really high.” (According to her Twitter account, Lapine continues to use tools like Dall-E to make her own art.)The entirety of this kind of publicly available AI, whether it works with images or words, as well as the many data-driven applications like it, is based on this wholesale appropriation of existing culture, the scope of which we can barely comprehend. Public or private, legal or otherwise, most of the text and images scraped up by these systems exist in the nebulous domain of “fair use” (permitted in the US, but questionable if not outright illegal in the EU). Like most of what goes on inside advanced neural networks, it’s really impossible to understand how they work from the outside, rare encounters such as Lapine’s aside. But we can be certain of this: far from being the magical, novel creations of brilliant machines, the outputs of this kind of AI is entirely dependent on the uncredited and unremunerated work of generations of human artists.AI image and text generation is pure primitive accumulation: expropriation of labour from the many for the enrichment and advancement of a few Silicon Valley technology companies and their billionaire owners. These companies made their money by inserting themselves into every aspect of everyday life, including the most personal and creative areas of our lives: our secret passions, our private conversations, our likenesses and our dreams. They enclosed our imaginations in much the same manner as landlords and robber barons enclosed once-common lands. They promised that in doing so they would open up new realms of human experience, give us access to all human knowledge, and create new kinds of human connection. Instead, they are selling us back our dreams repackaged as the products of machines, with the only promise being that they’ll make even more money advertising on the back of them.The weirdness of AI image generation exists in the output as well as the input. One user tried typing in nonsense phrases and was confused and somewhat discomforted to discover that Dall-E mini seemed to have a very good idea of what a “Crungus” was: an otherwise unknown phrase that consistently produced images of a snarling, naked, ogre-like figure. Crungus was sufficiently clear within the program’s imagination that he could be manipulated easily: other users quickly offered up images of ancient Crungus tapestries, Roman-style Crungus mosaics, oil paintings of Crungus, photos of Crungus hugging various celebrities, and, this being the internet, “sexy” Crungus.So, who or what is Crungus? Twitter users were quick to describe him as “the first AI cryptid”, a creature like Bigfoot who exists, in this case, within the underexplored terrain of the AI’s imagination. And this is about as clear an answer as we can get at this point, due to our limited understanding of how the system works. We can’t peer inside its decision-making processes because the way these neural networks “think” is inherently inhuman. It is the product of an incredibly complex, mathematical ordering of the world, as opposed to the historical, emotional way in which humans order their thinking. The Crungus is a dream emerging from the AI’s model of the world, composited from billions of references that have escaped their origins and coalesced into a mythological figure untethered from human experience. Which is fine, even amazing – but it does make one ask, whose dreams are being drawn upon here? What composite of human culture, what perspective on it, produced this nightmare?View image in fullscreen‘Twitter users were quick to describe crungus as ‘the first AI cryptid’, a creature who exists within the underexplored terrain of the AI’s imagination.’ Photograph: Dall-E/CraiyonA similar experience occurred to another digital artist experimenting with negative prompts, a technique for generating what the system considers to be the polar opposite of what is described. When the artist entered “Brando::-1”, the system returned something that looked a bit like a logo for a video game company called DIGITA PNTICS. That this may, across the multiple dimensions of the system’s vision of the world, be the opposite of Marlon Brando seems reasonable enough. But when they checked to see if it went the other way, by typing in “DIGITA PNTICS skyline logo::-1”, something much stranger happened: all of the images depicted a creepy-looking woman with sunken eyes and reddened cheeks, who the artist christened Loab. Once discovered, Loab seemed unusually and disturbingly persistent. Feeding the image back into the program, combined with ever more divergent text prompts, kept bringing Loab back, in increasingly nightmarish forms, in which blood, gore and violence predominated.Here’s one explanation for Loab, and possibly Crungus: although it’s very, very hard to imagine the way the machine’s imagination works, it is possible to imagine it having a shape. This shape is never going to be smooth or neatly rounded: rather, it is going to have troughs and peaks, mountains and valleys, areas full of information and areas lacking many features at all. Those areas of high information correspond to networks of associations that the system “knows” a lot about. One can imagine the regions related to human faces, cars and cats, for example, being pretty dense, given the distribution of images one finds on a survey of the whole internet.It is these regions that an AI image generator will draw on most heavily when creating its pictures. But there are other places, less visited, that come into play when negative prompting – or indeed, nonsense phrases – are deployed. In order to satisfy such queries, the machine must draw on more esoteric, less certain connections, and perhaps even infer from the totality of what it does know what its opposite may be. Here, in the hinterlands, Loab and Crungus are to be found.That’s a satisfying theory, but it does raise certain uncomfortable questions about why Crungus and Loab look like they do; why they tip towards horror and violence, why they hint at nightmares. AI image generators, in their attempt to understand and replicate the entirety of human visual culture, seem to have recreated our darkest fears as well. Perhaps this is just a sign that these systems are very good indeed at aping human consciousness, all the way down to the horror that lurks in the depths of existence: our fears of filth, death and corruption. And if so, we need to acknowledge that these will be persistent components of the machines we build in our own image. There is no escaping such obsessions and dangers, no moderating or engineering away the reality of the human condition. The dirt and disgust of living and dying will stay with us and need addressing, just as the hope, love, joy and discovery will.This matters, because AI image generators will do what all previous technologies have done, but they will also go further. They will reproduce the biases and prejudices of those who create them, like the webcams that only recognise white faces, or the predictive policing systems that lay siege to low-income neighbourhoods. And they will also up the game: the benchmark of AI performance is shifting from the narrow domain of puzzles and challenges – playing chess or Go, or obeying traffic laws – to the much broader territory of imagination and creativity.While claims about AI’s “creativity” might be overblown – there is no true originality in image generation, only very skilled imitation and pastiche – that doesn’t mean it isn’t capable of taking over many common “artistic” tasks long considered the preserve of skilled workers, from illustrators and graphic designers to musicians, videographers and, indeed, writers. This is a huge shift. AI is now engaging with the underlying experience of feeling, emotion and mood, and this will allow it to shape and influence the world at ever deeper and more persuasive levels.ChatGPT was introduced in November 2022 by OpenAI, and further shifted our understanding of how AI and human creativity might interact. Structured as a chatbot – a program that mimics human conversation – ChatGPT is capable of a lot more than conversation. When properly entreated, it is capable of writing working computer code, solving mathematical problems and mimicking common writing tasks, from book reviews to academic papers, wedding speeches and legal contracts.It was immediately obvious how the program could be a boon to those who find, say, writing emails or essays difficult, but also how, as with image generators, it could be used to replace those who make a living from those tasks. Many schools and universities have already implemented policies that ban the use of ChatGPT amid fears that students will use it to write their essays, while the academic journal Nature has had to publish policies explaining why the program cannot be listed as an author of research papers (it can’t give consent, and it can’t be held accountable). But institutions themselves are not immune from inappropriate uses of the tool: in February, the Peabody College of Education and Human Development, part of Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, shocked students when it sent out a letter of condolence and advice following a school shooting in Michigan. While the letter spoke of the value of community, mutual respect and togetherness, a note at the bottom stated that it was written by ChatGPT – which felt both morally wrong and somehow false or uncanny to many. It seems there are many areas of life where the intercession of machines requires some deeper thought.If it would be inappropriate to replace our communications wholesale with ChatGPT, then one clear trend is for it to become a kind of wise assistant, guiding us through the morass of available knowledge towards the information we seek. Microsoft has been an early mover in this direction, reconfiguring its often disparaged search engine Bing as a ChatGPT-powered chatbot, and massively boosting its popularity by doing so. But despite the online (and journalistic) rush to consult ChatGPT on almost every conceivable problem, its relationship to knowledge itself is somewhat shaky.Q&AAI explained: why do chatbots make errors?ShowLarge language models (LLM) do not understand things in a conventional sense – and they are only as good, or as accurate, as the information with which they are provided.They are essentially machines for matching patterns . Whether the output is “true” is not the point, so long as it matches the pattern.If you ask a chatbot to write a biography of a moderately famous person, it may get some facts right, but then invent other details that sound like they should fit in biographies of that sort of person.And it can be wrongfooted: ask GPT3 whether one pound of feathers weighs more than two pounds of steel, it will focus on the fact that the question looks like the classic trick question. It will not notice that the numbers have been changed.Google’s rival to ChatGPT, called Bard, had an embarrassing debut  when a video demo of the chatbot showed it giving the wrong answer to a question about the James Webb space telescope.Read more: Seven top AI acronyms explainedWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.One recent personal interaction with ChatGPT went like this. I asked it to suggest some books to read based on a new area of interest: multi-species democracy, the idea of including non-human creatures in political decision-making processes. It’s pretty much the most useful application of the tool: “Hey, here’s a thing I’m thinking about, can you tell me some more?” And ChatGPT obliged. It gave me a list of several books that explored this novel area of interest in depth, and described in persuasive human language why I should read them. This was brilliant! Except, it turned out that only one of the four books listed actually existed, and several of the concepts ChatGPT thought I should explore further were lifted wholesale from rightwing propaganda: it explained, for example, that the “wise use” movement promoted animal rights, when in fact it is a libertarian, anti-environment concept promoting the expansion of property rights.Now, this didn’t happen because ChatGPT is inherently rightwing. It’s because it’s inherently stupid. It has read most of the internet, and it knows what human language is supposed to sound like, but it has no relation to reality whatsoever. It is dreaming sentences that sound about right, and listening to it talk is frankly about as interesting as listening to someone’s dreams. It is very good at producing what sounds like sense, and best of all at producing cliche and banality, which has composed the majority of its diet, but it remains incapable of relating meaningfully to the world as it actually is. Distrust anyone who pretends that this is an echo, even an approximation, of consciousness. (As this piece was going to publication, OpenAI released a new version of the system that powers ChatGPT, and said it was “less likely to make up facts”.)The belief in this kind of AI as actually knowledgeable or meaningful is actively dangerous. It risks poisoning the well of collective thought, and of our ability to think at all. If, as is being proposed by technology companies, the results of ChatGPT queries will be provided as answers to those seeking knowledge online, and if, as has been proposed by some commentators, ChatGPT is used in the classroom as a teaching aide, then its hallucinations will enter the permanent record, effectively coming between us and more legitimate, testable sources of information, until the line between the two is so blurred as to be invisible. Moreover, there has never been a time when our ability as individuals to research and critically evaluate knowledge on our own behalf has been more necessary, not least because of the damage that technology companies have already done to the ways in which information is disseminated. To place all of our trust in the dreams of badly programmed machines would be to abandon such critical thinking altogether.AI technologies are bad for the planet too. Training a single AI model – according to research published in 2019 – might emit the equivalent of more than 284 tonnes of carbon dioxide, which is nearly five times as much as the entire lifetime of the average American car, including its manufacture. These emissions are expected to grow by nearly 50% over the next five years, all while the planet continues to heat up, acidifying the oceans, igniting wildfires, throwing up superstorms and driving species to extinction. It’s hard to think of anything more utterly stupid than artificial intelligence, as it is practised in the current era.So, let’s take a step back. If these current incarnations of “artificial” “intelligence” are so dreary, what are the alternatives? Can we imagine powerful information sorting and communicating technologies that don’t exploit, misuse, mislead and supplant us? Yes, we can – once we step outside the corporate power networks that have come to define the current wave of AI.In fact, there are already examples of AI being used to benefit specific communities by bypassing the entrenched power of corporations. Indigenous languages are under threat around the world. The UN estimates that one disappears every two weeks, and with that disappearance goes generations of knowledge and experience. This problem, the result of colonialism and racist assimilation policies over centuries, is compounded by the rising dominance of machine-learning language models, which ensure that popular languages increase their power, while lesser-known ones are drained of exposure and expertise.In Aotearoa New Zealand, a small non-profit radio station called Te Hiku Media, which broadcasts in the Māori language, decided to address this disparity between the representation of different languages in technology. Its massive archive of more than 20 years of broadcasts, representing a vast range of idioms, colloquialisms and unique phrases, many of them no longer spoken by anyone living, was being digitised, but needed to be transcribed to be of use to language researchers and the Māori community. In response, the radio station decided to train its own speech recognition model, so that it would be able to “listen” to its archive and produce transcriptions.Over the next few years, Te Hiku Media, using open-source technologies as well as systems it developed in house, achieved the almost impossible: a highly accurate speech recognition system for the Māori language, which was built and owned by its own language community. This was more than a software effort. The station contacted every Māori community group it could and asked them to record themselves speaking pre-written statements in order to provide a corpus of annotated speech, a prerequisite for training its model.There was a cash prize for whoever submitted the most sentences – one activist, Te Mihinga Komene, recorded 4,000 phrases alone – but the organisers found that the greatest motivation for contributors was the shared vision of revitalising the language while keeping it in the community’s ownership. Within a few weeks, it created a model that recognised recorded speech with 86% accuracy – more than enough to get it started transcribing its full archive.Becoming a chatbot: my life as a real estate AI’s human backupRead moreTe Hiku Media’s achievement cleared a path for other indigenous groups to follow, with similar projects now being undertaken by Mohawk peoples in south-eastern Canada and Native Hawaiians. It also established the principle of data sovereignty around indigenous languages, and by extension, other forms of indigenous knowledge. When international for-profit companies started approaching Māori speakers to help build their own models, Te Hiku Media campaigned against these efforts, arguing, “They suppressed our languages and physically beat it out of our grandparents, and now they want to sell our language back to us as a service.”“Data is the last frontier of colonisation,” wrote Keoni Mahelona, a Native Hawaiian and one of the co-founders of Te Hiku Media. All of Te Hiku’s work is released under what it named the Kaitiakitanga License, a legal guarantee of guardianship and custodianship that ensures that all the data that went into the language model and other projects remains the property of the community that created it – in this case, the Māori speakers who offered their help – and is theirs to license, or not, as they deem appropriate according to their tikanga (Māori customs and protocols). In this way, the Māori language is revitalised, while resisting and altering the systems of digital colonialism that continue to repeat centuries of oppression.The lesson of the current wave of “artificial” “intelligence”, I feel, is that intelligence is a poor thing when it is imagined by corporations. If your view of the world is one in which profit maximisation is the king of virtues, and all things shall be held to the standard of shareholder value, then of course your artistic, imaginative, aesthetic and emotional expressions will be woefully impoverished. We deserve better from the tools we use, the media we consume and the communities we live within, and we will only get what we deserve when we are capable of participating in them fully. And don’t be intimidated by them either – they’re really not that complicated. As the science-fiction legend Ursula K Le Guin wrote: “Technology is what we can learn to do.” This article was amended on 17 March 2023, to clarify the author’s view that while today’s AI is based on many ideas that were theorised decades ago, that does not mean that more recent technological advances were not necessary for the development of programs such as ChatGPT.This article was adapted from the new edition of New Dark Age: Technology and the End of the Future, published by VersoExplore more on these topicsThe long readArtificial intelligence (AI)ChatGPTfeaturesShareReuse this content",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Humans are hard-wired to dream, to create, to innovate. Each of us seeks to do work that gives us purpose — to write a great novel, to make a discovery, to build strong communities, to care for the sick. The urge to connect to the core of our work lives in all of us. But today, we spend too much time consumed by the drudgery of work on tasks that zap our time, creativity and energy. To reconnect to the soul of our work, we don’t just need a better way of doing the same things. We need a whole new way to work.
Today, we are bringing the power of next-generation AI to work. Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot — your copilot for work. It combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with your data in the Microsoft Graph and the Microsoft 365 apps to turn your words into the most powerful productivity tool on the planet.
“Today marks the next major step in the evolution of how we interact with computing, which will fundamentally change the way we work and unlock a new wave of productivity growth,” said Satya Nadella, Chairman and CEO, Microsoft. “With our new copilot for work, we’re giving people more agency and making technology more accessible through the most universal interface — natural language.”
Copilot is integrated into Microsoft 365 in two ways. It works alongside you, embedded in the Microsoft 365 apps you use every day — Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams and more — to unleash creativity, unlock productivity and uplevel skills. Today we’re also announcing an entirely new experience: Business Chat. Business Chat works across the LLM, the Microsoft 365 apps, and your data — your calendar, emails, chats, documents, meetings and contacts — to do things you’ve never been able to do before. You can give it natural language prompts like “Tell my team how we updated the product strategy,” and it will generate a status update based on the morning’s meetings, emails and chat threads.
With Copilot, you’re always in control. You decide what to keep, modify or discard. Now, you can be more creative in Word, more analytical in Excel, more expressive in PowerPoint, more productive in Outlook and more collaborative in Teams.

Unleash creativity. With Copilot in Word, you can jump-start the creative process so you never start with a blank slate again. Copilot gives you a first draft to edit and iterate on — saving hours in writing, sourcing, and editing time. Sometimes Copilot will be right, other times usefully wrong — but it will always put you further ahead. You’re always in control as the author, driving your unique ideas forward, prompting Copilot to shorten, rewrite or give feedback. Copilot in PowerPoint helps you create beautiful presentations with a simple prompt, adding relevant content from a document you made last week or last year. And with Copilot in Excel, you can analyze trends and create professional-looking data visualizations in seconds.
Unlock productivity. We all want to focus on the 20% of our work that really matters, but 80% of our time is consumed with busywork that bogs us down. Copilot lightens the load. From summarizing long email threads to quickly drafting suggested replies, Copilot in Outlook helps you clear your inbox in minutes, not hours. And every meeting is a productive meeting with Copilot in Teams. It can summarize key discussion points — including who said what and where people are aligned and where they disagree — and suggest action items, all in real time during a meeting. And with Copilot in Power Platform, anyone can automate repetitive tasks, create chatbots and go from idea to working app in minutes.
GitHub data shows that Copilot promises to unlock productivity for everyone. Among developers who use GitHub Copilot, 88% say they are more productive, 74% say that they can focus on more satisfying work, and 77% say it helps them spend less time searching for information or examples.
But Copilot doesn’t just supercharge individual productivity. It creates a new knowledge model for every organization — harnessing the massive reservoir of data and insights that lies largely inaccessible and untapped today. Business Chat works across all your business data and apps to surface the information and insights you need from a sea of data — so knowledge flows freely across the organization, saving you valuable time searching for answers. You will be able to access Business Chat from Microsoft 365.com, from Bing when you’re signed in with your work account, or from Teams.
Uplevel skills. Copilot makes you better at what you’re good at and lets you quickly master what you’ve yet to learn. The average person uses only a handful of commands — such as “animate a slide” or “insert a table” — from the thousands available across Microsoft 365. Now, all that rich functionality is unlocked using just natural language. And this is only the beginning.
Copilot will fundamentally change how people work with AI and how AI works with people. As with any new pattern of work, there’s a learning curve — but those who embrace this new way of working will quickly gain an edge.

The Copilot System: Enterprise-ready AI
Microsoft is uniquely positioned to deliver enterprise-ready AI with the Copilot System. Copilot is more than OpenAI’s ChatGPT embedded into Microsoft 365. It’s a sophisticated processing and orchestration engine working behind the scenes to combine the power of LLMs, including GPT-4, with the Microsoft 365 apps and your business data in the Microsoft Graph — now accessible to everyone through natural language.
Grounded in your business data. AI-powered LLMs are trained on a large but limited corpus of data. The key to unlocking productivity in business lies in connecting LLMs to your business data — in a secure, compliant, privacy-preserving way. Microsoft 365 Copilot has real-time access to both your content and context in the Microsoft Graph. This means it generates answers anchored in your business content — your documents, emails, calendar, chats, meetings, contacts and other business data — and combines them with your working context — the meeting you’re in now, the email exchanges you’ve had on a topic, the chat conversations you had last week — to deliver accurate, relevant, contextual responses.
Built on Microsoft’s comprehensive approach to security, compliance and privacy. Copilot is integrated into Microsoft 365 and automatically inherits all your company’s valuable security, compliance, and privacy policies and processes. Two-factor authentication, compliance boundaries, privacy protections, and more make Copilot the AI solution you can trust.
Architected to protect tenant, group and individual data. We know data leakage is a concern for customers. Copilot LLMs are not trained on your tenant data or your prompts. Within your tenant, our time-tested permissioning model ensures that data won’t leak across user groups. And on an individual level, Copilot presents only data you can access using the same technology that we’ve been using for years to secure customer data.
Integrated into the apps millions use every day. Microsoft 365 Copilot is integrated in the productivity apps millions of people use and rely on every day for work and life — Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams and more. An intuitive and consistent user experience ensures it looks, feels and behaves the same way in Teams as it does in Outlook, with a shared design language for prompts, refinements and commands.
Designed to learn new skills. Microsoft 365 Copilot’s foundational skills are a game changer for productivity: It can already create, summarize, analyze, collaborate and automate using your specific business content and context. But it doesn’t stop there. Copilot knows how to command apps (e.g., “animate this slide”) and work across apps, translating a Word document into a PowerPoint presentation. And Copilot is designed to learn new skills. For example, with Viva Sales, Copilot can learn how to connect to CRM systems of record to pull customer data — like interaction and order histories — into communications. As Copilot learns about new domains and processes, it will be able to perform even more sophisticated tasks and queries.
Committed to building responsibly
At Microsoft, we are guided by our AI principles and Responsible AI Standard and decades of research on AI, grounding and privacy-preserving machine learning. A multidisciplinary team of researchers, engineers and policy experts reviews our AI systems for potential harms and mitigations — refining training data, filtering to limit harmful content, query- and result-blocking sensitive topics, and applying Microsoft technologies like InterpretML and Fairlearn to help detect and correct data bias. We make it clear how the system makes decisions by noting limitations, linking to sources, and prompting users to review, fact-check and adjust content based on subject-matter expertise.
Moving boldly as we learn 
In the months ahead, we’re bringing Copilot to all our productivity apps—Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, Viva, Power Platform, and more. We’ll share more on pricing and licensing soon. Earlier this month we announced Dynamics 365 Copilot as the world’s first AI Copilot in both CRM and ERP to bring the next-generation AI to every line of business.
Everyone deserves to find purpose and meaning in their work — and Microsoft 365 Copilot can help. To serve the unmet needs of our customers, we must move quickly and responsibly, learning as we go. We’re testing Copilot with a small group of customers to get feedback and improve our models as we scale, and we will expand to more soon.

Photo: DADO RUVIC/REUTERSMany people have watched with delight and disquiet as generative AI has reached new levels of sophistication. Marketers are intrigued, but cautious. The ad industry already was experimenting with artificial intelligence to help with creative work, but the arrival of viral chatbot ChatGPT has marketers trying to figure out how they can effectively use the kind of generative AI that underpins it—systems that produce content from text to images. ChatGPT maker OpenAI this week released GPT4, the latest iteration of its tech, calling it the most capable yet. Some industry experts say the technology is helpful as a launching point for quickly producing creative assets on a large scale for social media and elsewhere, and may cut down on rote tasks that take up time. Many see big potential, but plenty of issues and questions remain. Here are five things marketers should know about the technology. Generative AI can hatch a lot of ideasJones Road Beauty, a makeup brand founded by cosmetics pioneer Bobbi Brown, leaned on generative AI for a video shoot this week using a concept developed by the productivity and AI company Notion AI.  Cody Plofker, chief marketing officer at Jones Road, expects generative AI to be a valuable way to come up with ideas and work more quickly. The technology could cut the time it takes to produce the dozens of ads a week that Jones Road runs with Meta Platforms Inc., which owns Facebook and Instagram, Mr. Plofker said.Newsletter Sign-upWSJ | CMO TodayCMO Today delivers the most important news of the day for media and marketing professionals.PreviewSubscribe“You can say, ‘Give me 10 ad angles for Miracle Balm based on customer reviews,’ or something like that,” he said. It could also streamline production work on those assets and more quickly make variations of them.AI may also help brands battle “creative fatigue,” said Wesley ter Haar, executive director at digital advertising and marketing services company S4 Capital PLC and co-founder of S4 company MediaMonks. “One of the key benefits of generative AI is its ability to generate large volumes of content in seconds, which means you can visualize and test out different concepts at speed,” he said. “You can also easily swap out different elements—like changing the background, changing characters—at any point in the production process without having to go back to the drawing board.”Generative AI may help agencies and brands do more with fewer people, Mr. ter Haar said. “I think it alleviates some of that head count pressure,” he said, adding that he believes the human element will always be there and that AI doesn’t fully replace a human’s perspective or skill set. Cutting back on busywork With generative AI, ad creatives will spend less time on rote tasks and more time working strategically, marketing experts said. “Some of those mundane tasks, some of those things that have traditionally been done by hand, so to speak, those go away,” said Paolo Yuvienco, chief technology officer at ad holding company Omnicom Group Inc. Jones Road Beauty’s Mr. Plofker said generative AI could largely relieve his marketing team of things like analyzing customer reviews.“If you can have AI read all of our customer reviews, and then kind of consolidate that and give a summary of what people are saying, good and bad—I see tremendous value in that,” he said. It’s not replacing creatives (yet)Mint Mobile, the wireless carrier that has agreed to be acquired by T-Mobile US Inc., in January released an ad featuring Ryan Reynolds—a part owner—reading an oddly off-key script written by ChatGPT. The ad created buzz for the brand, but got its power more from the copy the AI served up than from its ability to produce creative messaging, Mint CMO Aron North said. The ad got “an emotional response—it’s shock and amazement that a computer can do this,” Mr. North said. “But I don’t necessarily feel other emotions, like love or connection or humor. I’m not laughing with it—I’m laughing at it.” The new capabilities have invigorated a long-running discussion about the potential for automation in advertising, but haven’t changed the conclusion, according to Jay Pattisall, a vice president and principal analyst at Forrester Research Inc. While some might look at generative AI’s ability to write prose, for instance, it is only generating output from data and not originating thought or expression, he said. “There has always been a tension between the art and the science of marketing and creativity, even when the technology was much more rudimentary than that of generative AI,” Mr. Pattisall said. “Machines in whatever form simply just can’t replace or replicate human creativity. That was true then, and it is absolutely true now.” Advertisement


Stay vigilantMarketers need to closely vet the data sources that train their generative AI models, and monitor the accuracy of their output, Mr. Pattisall said, citing risks such as an advertisement with incorrect prices.There are questions around ethics and bias that marketers must be aware of, Mr. Pattisall said. If generative AI is trained on specious or biased information or sources, its output will reflect that, possibly churning out offensive, incomplete or outright false content.Omnicom’s Mr. Yuvienco said that although it is leaning into and deeply exploring this area, the ad giant is cautious about using generative AI to create consumer-facing work given all the outstanding questions. “When it starts to generate things that are visible to our clients, that are visible to consumers, that’s when you start getting into some tricky legal things, ownership, biases, all the things that you can’t necessarily control or don’t have a good handle on today,” he said. If a machine creates it, how much do you need to actually alter the output from the machine in order to then take ownership of it? These things haven’t been answered. — Paolo Yuvienco, Omnicom GroupAmong those questions is who owns an idea if it came from generative AI.“If a machine creates it, how much do you need to actually alter the output from the machine in order to then take ownership of it? These things haven’t been answered,” Mr. Yuvienco said. “It’s a little bit of a wait-and-see game.” There is also legal uncertainty around what generative AI learns from, and what happens when it is trained using material owned by others.While human creativity also uses past work to build on new concepts, it isn’t clear yet how courts will treat the issue when it comes to generative AI, S4’s Mr. ter Haar added. “I’m sure the lawsuits will be extremely interesting.” And the technology itself still has room for improvement. Insofar as it might be used to create imagery or ads, Mr. Plofker says it’s just not ready for prime time. “I’ve tested them. None of them that I have seen are there yet,” he said. Carve out a place in the budget and the organizationIndustry players are reorganizing their teams to keep up with AI’s quickly changing capabilities. Omnicom has created a “center of excellence” around automation across its agencies, along with an AI steering committee. It uses these groups to explore what’s possible with areas such as generative AI and how it can affect its work, along with the constraints and legal implications. Mint Mobile dedicates 10% of its marketing budget to “unknown, unproven and untested” causes, according to Mr. North. It is using that budget to experiment with early-stage technologies, such as generative AI. “Because of that, we can assume risk that won’t hurt our business,” he said. “When you have money set aside, and you also have teams that have the mind-set that is not risk-averse, but risk-embrace … they’re willing to go out and try things.” Write to Megan Graham at megan.graham@wsj.comCopyright ©2024 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

ChatGPT and other generative artificial intelligence tools change everything. They are a disruptive technology, bringing radical change to the way in which we live. Our work lives have been especially disrupted by generative AI because it represents the first time in which artificial intelligence has been proven to be able to truly replace people at their jobs.
Generative AI’s Effect on the Tech Job Market1. It is jeopardizing jobs for “hands-on-only” tech people.
2. It is replacing systems administrators.
3. It is increasing the demand for human skills.
4. It is lightening the work load for business leaders.

ChatGPT, launched in November 2022, is the first AI platform to communicate exceptionally well, providing accuracy in its responses that are often better than what a person could provide. The technical work it performs is done on a professional level. Overall, it represents the first generative AI platform that is good enough to be a game changer in the tech space. 
Chat GPT’s design allows it to accomplish things that computers had been incapable of on their own up to this point. As a result, it is poised to replace a significant percentage of the workforce. Reports are already warning of its ability to replace jobs in many sectors, including the media, legal industry, finance, education, customer service and, of course, technology.
However, the news about generative AI’s impact on the job market is not all bad. Here are five key ways in which generative AI is changing the tech job market.

Generative AI Is Replacing Some Tech Positions
“Hands-on-only” tech people do not bring people skills to their positions. Their jobs only require them to touch the technology. As a result, they are truly in jeopardy of losing their jobs to generative AI.
Generative AI can program just like a programmer, but faster. It can do in five seconds or less what it would take a human 30 to 45 minutes to accomplish. That level of efficiency makes it extremely valuable in the business world.
Generative AI is not perfect, but it is comparable to human workers in terms of skills. What gives it the edge over its human counterpart is that it will work 24 hours per day, seven days per week without complaining or getting tired. Generative AI does not ask for a raise, does not ask for a four-day workweek, does not need health insurance or other benefits and does not get sick.
Programmers who are only techies and who occupy introductory to medium-level positions should be concerned about their careers. That’s because generative AI can take those jobs away and, in doing so, can save organizations a tremendous amount of money.
Microsoft has already provided an example of this. In January, it announced layoffs that it said would affect 10,000 employees. During the same month, it announced it was investing $10 billion in ChatGPT.
 
Generative AI Is Replacing Systems Admins
Systems administrators can also be the type of “hands-on-only” people whose positions will be replaced by generative artificial intelligence. In some cases, systems administrators’ responsibilities are limited to installing software, writing basic Python scripts and Windows power shell scripts, and other hands-on processes. Generative AI can do all of those things automatically.
This does not necessarily mean that generative AI will do away with the need for systems administrators. However, it will reduce the need. With the help of ChatGPT and other generative AI-driven technology, one superstar systems administrator or programmer can do the work of 10 to 20 people. 
 
Generative AI Is Replacing Digital Marketing Copywriters
Tech and software companies often rely heavily on digital marketing to promote their products and acquire new customers. Whether they create in-house positions for this role or rely on outside vendors, copywriters represent an expense for many tech companies. Generative AI is doing away with that expense.
Generative AI can write copy in a variety of voices, which the user can select. You can even train it to write in your voice, mimicking your tone and your word choice. Provide it with a topic, and it will find information and present it with great accuracy.
 
Generative AI Is Increasing the Demand for Human Skills
Generative AI can deliver a wide range of skills with better efficiency, speed, and effectiveness than humans. But it is not human and cannot deliver many qualities which are critical to the technology world. For many technology workers, this is great news.
Generative AI cannot develop a relationship with a client or coworker, lead a team or close a sale. All of these are essential tasks that companies must carry out to succeed and for which humans are required.
Generative AI also cannot do the work of cloud architects, network architects, and enterprise architects, which is to figure out holistic solutions that improve business performance with technology. By nature, those positions must communicate with and connect to a large number of people. They must manage stakeholders, design a solution, present a solution and sell the solution, all while leading large teams. For these positions, generative AI is a tool that can make the job easier, rather than a tool that will replace the job.

Generative AI Lightens the Load for Business Leaders
The capabilities that generative AI brings to the business world are a boon for many positions, especially those leadership roles in which a lot of collaboration is necessary. Leaders can dramatically improve their efficiency and effectiveness by leveraging generative AI to assist them with a wide range of business responsibilities. It serves as a valuable tool in any leader’s toolbox, playing a role in creating presentations, drafting documents, and responding to RFIs, RFPs and RFQs.
Overall, technology professionals who want to benefit from the changes that artificial intelligence is bringing to the workplace need to understand that generative AI can spit out code and copy, but it can’t connect with others. The technology job market will always have opportunities for those who can build teams and speak across cultural boundaries in a way that so we can bring out the best in others.
For programmers, systems administrators, and copywriters, generative AI promises to create a much more challenging job market. For professionals like cloud architects, network architects and enterprise architects, however, the growth of generative AI will only mean more opportunities. 
The key for any tech worker looking for a successful career in the age of artificial intelligence will be to bring to the workforce tech savvy along with the people skills that generative AI cannot deliver.

The success of ChatGPT and its competitors is based on what's termed emergent behaviors. These systems, called large language models (LLMs), weren't trained to output natural-sounding language (or effective malware); they were simply tasked with tracking the statistics of word usage. But, given a large enough training set of language samples and a sufficiently complex neural network, their training resulted in an internal representation that ""understood"" English usage and a large compendium of facts. Their complex behavior emerged from a far simpler training.
A team at Meta has now reasoned that this sort of emergent understanding shouldn't be limited to languages. So it has trained an LLM on the statistics of the appearance of amino acids within proteins and used the system's internal representation of what it learned to extract information about the structure of those proteins. The result is not quite as good as the best competing AI systems for predicting protein structures, but it's considerably faster and still getting better.Enter your email to get the Ars Technica newsletterclose dialogJoin Ars Technica andGet Our Best Tech StoriesDelivered Straight to your Inbox.Please enter aboveSIGN ME UPBy signing up, you agree to our user agreement (including the  class action waiver and arbitration provisions), our privacy policy and cookie statement, and to receive marketing and account-related emails from Ars Technica.

LLMs: Not just for language
The first thing you need to know to understand this work is that, while the term ""language"" in the name ""LLM"" refers to their original development for language processing tasks, they can potentially be used for a variety of purposes. So, while language processing is a common use case for LLMs, these models have other capabilities as well. In fact, the term ""Large"" is far more informative, in that all LLMs have a large number of nodes—the ""neurons"" in a neural network—and an even larger number of values that describe the weights of the connections among those nodes. While they were first developed to process language, they can potentially be used for a variety of tasks. Ars VideoHow Scientists Respond to Science Deniers
The task in this new work was to take the linear string of amino acids that form a protein and use that to predict how those amino acids are arranged in three-dimensional space once the protein is mature. This 3D structure is essential for the function of proteins and can help us understand how proteins misbehave after they pick up mutations or allow us to design drugs to inactivate the proteins of pathogens, among other uses. Predicting protein structures was a challenge that flustered generations of scientists until this decade, when Google's AI group DeepMind announced a system that, for most practical definitions of ""solved,"" solved the problem. Google's system was quickly followed by one developed along similar lines by the academic community.
Both of these efforts relied on the fact that evolution had already crafted large sets of related proteins that adopted similar 3D configurations. By lining up these related proteins, the AI systems could make inferences about where and what sort of changes could be tolerated while maintaining a similar structure, as well as how changes in one part of the protein could be compensated for by changes in the other. These evolutionary constraints let the systems work out what parts of the protein must be close to each other in 3D space, and thus what the structure was likely to be.
The reasoning behind Meta's new work is that training an LLM-style neural network could be done in a way that would allow the system to sort out the same type of evolutionary constraints without needing to go about the messy business of aligning all the protein sequences in the first place. Just as the rules of grammar would emerge from training an LLM on language samples, the constraints imposed by evolution would emerge from training the system on protein samples. 
Paying attention to amino acids
How this worked in practice was that the researchers took a large sample of proteins and randomly blocked out the identity of a few individual amino acids. The system was then asked to predict the amino acid that should be present. In the process of this training, the system developed the ability to use information like statistics on the frequency of amino acids and the context of the surrounding protein to make its guesses. Implicit in that context are the things that required dedicated processing in the earlier efforts: the identity of proteins that are related by evolution, and what variation within those relatives tells us about what parts of the protein are near each other in 3D space.
Assuming that reasoning about how LLMs would work is true (and Meta was building on earlier research that suggested it was), the trick to developing a working system is getting the information contained in the neural network back out. Neural networks are often considered a ""black box,"" in that we don't necessarily know how they come to their decisions. But that's becoming increasingly less true over time, as people build in features like the ability to audit the decision-making process.
In this case, the researchers relied on the LLM's ability to describe what's termed its ""attention pattern."" In practical terms, when you give the LLM a string of amino acids and ask it to evaluate them, the attention pattern is the set of features that it looks at in order to perform its analysis.
To convert the attention pattern to a 3D structure, the researchers trained a second AI system to correlate the attention pattern for proteins where we know their 3D structures with the actual structure. Since we only have experimentally determined structures for a limited number of proteins, the researchers also used some of the structures predicted by one of the other AI systems as part of this training.
The resulting system was termed ESM-2. Once it was fully trained, ESM-2 was able to ingest a raw string of amino acids and output a 3D protein structure, along with a score that represents its confidence in the accuracy of that structure.

But AI is not a monolith, and anyone who says it’s either all good or all evil is oversimplifying. At this point, he said, it’s not clear whether generative AI will turn out to be a transformative technology or a passing fad.“Given how quickly generative AI is developing and how frequently we’re learning about new capabilities and risks, staying grounded when talking about these systems feels like a full-time job,” Narayanan said. “My main suggestion for everyday people is to be more comfortable with accepting that we simply don’t know for sure how a lot of these emerging developments are going to play out.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe capacity for a technology to be used both for good and ill is not unique to generative AI. Other types of AI tools, such as those used to discover new pharmaceuticals, have their own dark sides. Last year, researchers found that the same systems were able to brainstorm some 40,000 potentially lethal new bioweapons.More familiar technologies, from recommendation algorithms to social media to camera drones, are similarly amenable to inspiring and disturbing applications. But generative AI is inspiring especially strong reactions, in part because it can do things — compose poems or make art — that were long thought to be uniquely human.The lesson isn’t that technology is inherently good, evil or even neutral, said O’Mara, the history professor. How it’s designed, deployed and marketed to users can affect the degree to which something like an AI chatbot lends itself to harm and abuse. And the “overheated” hype over ChatGPT, with people declaring that it will transform society or lead to “robot overlords,” risks clouding the judgment of both its users and its creators.“Now we have this sort of AI arms race — this race to be the first,” O’Mara said. “And that’s actually where my worry is. If you have companies like Microsoft and Google falling over each other to be the company that has the AI-enabled search — if you’re trying to move really fast to do that, that’s when things get broken.”Share115 CommentsNewsletterAs news breaksTech News AlertsBreaking news email alerts on technology and the tech industry.Sign upSubscribe to comment and get the full experience.

In a pre-recorded demo event dubbed “The Future of Work With AI” — which felt to this reporter like a highly produced infomercial (“Wait, there’s more!”) — Microsoft capped an epic week in generative AI by announcing Copilot 365 to “change work as we know it.”
Layering on to the earlier “Copilot” verbiage that accompanied its Bing announcements last month,  Copilot 365 combines large language models — namely GPT-4, which Microsoft confirmed powers Bing —  with Microsoft Graph data (from your calendar, emails, chats, documents, meetings) and Microsoft 365 apps including Teams, Word, Outlook and Excel.

For example, by plugging into your calendar and email, Copilot 365 can help you get ready for the day, generating bullets for you to focus on in your next meeting. It can also generate documents based on existing documents; create a PowerPoint, complete with layouts and images; use natural language to analyze data in Excel; and automatically capture meeting notes. 
In addition to being embedded in 365 apps, Copilot is also offered as a sidekick in a new Business Chat experience.
According to a Microsoft blog post, Business Chat “works alongside you, using the power of the Microsoft Graph to bring together data from across your documents, presentations, email, calendar, notes, and contacts. Bring together information from multiple sources to keep everyone on the team on the same page and moving forward together. Spend less time focused on the tools and more time focused on the most important work. Today, our preview customers will be able to access Business Chat in Microsoft Teams.” 
In a separate announcement, Microsoft also debuted the new Copilot in Power platform for AI-powered no-code/low-code software development, including:  
Copilot in Power Apps: Describe what you want the app to do, and it will generate a data table. You can then refine and improve the app with natural language.Copilot in Power Automate: Automate flows with natural language in seconds to digitize and speed up business processes.Copilot in Power Virtual Agents: Use generative AI to build intelligent, conversational chatbots in minutes.
Microsoft Copilot 365 offers starting point for nearly all knowledge work 
Copilot now essentially becomes the starting point for all knowledge work in Microsoft. advertisement
Forrester AI analyst Rowan Curran weighed in on the announcements. “Embedding generative AI capabilities like text and image generation into everyday office and productivity tools has the potential to significantly change people’s workflows in an enormous swath of job roles,” he told VentureBeat. “Having capabilities to generate a summarization of a white paper into a blog post, and the ability to do it within your core productivity app, reduces the friction around integrating these tools into workflows, because the user doesn’t have to go to a different tool to use them.”
However, he pointed out that the models become far more powerful when they are fine-tuned on a company’s specific data.
“When the major productivity-suite providers start enabling this capability is when we may start to see an acceleration of the use of these capabilities, even if they don’t immediately take off in their initial version,” he said. 
The impacts might not transform the workplace tomorrow, he explained. “But the wheel has started rolling forward, and over the next several years we can expect to see compounding effects from the use of these embedded generative capabilities.”
Microsoft caps an epic generative AI weekadvertisement
The Microsoft Copilot 365 release caps an epic week in generative AI. It began with Google’s announcements on Monday of new generative AI capabilities and features for developers, through a PaLM API and in Google Cloud, as well as new integrations for users of Google Workspace, including in Gmail and Google Docs.
Google’s announcements felt far more like a generative AI laundry list than Microsoft’s finely-honed marketing effort. And they came just a month after Google unveiled its search chatbot Bard and less than a week after Bloomberg reported that a new internal Google directive “requires generative AI to be incorporated into all of its biggest products within months.” 
The hot AI productivity party continues
Still, this two-horse Big Tech productivity race shows no signs of slowing down. One bigger question is what will happen to the hot AI productivity app party that’s been dancing its way around Silicon Valley for months now. 
For example, can the start-up productivity darlings, from Jasper and Tome to HyperWrite and Writer, compete with Microsoft and Google’s offerings? Or will Big Tech take over this dance floor for good?

Another major goal, he said, is to “create policies and guardrails for agencies that allow them to be able to use those tools responsibly.”The best way to follow issues you care about.The best way to follow issues you care about.The best way to follow issues you care about.Cities are changing fast.

In many instances, they have learned to proceed with caution. There are several ethical considerations raised by the application of AI, including privacy concerns and questions of bias that can have disproportionate impacts on people of color or women when applied to criminal justice or hiring decisions.The position of AI director isn’t an entirely new one for New York. In 2019, under then-Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration, New York City hired Neal Parikh, a start-up founder who got his PhD in machine learning from Stanford University, to run artificial intelligence strategy, a role that was then under the Mayor’s Office of the Chief Technology Officer.“The idea was, essentially, we can't really write these AI policies governing the city's own use of this without understanding what is even out there,” Parikh recalled. His main priority then was shaping New York City’s AI strategy, with a document that laid out the city’s philosophy of digital rights and the areas of opportunity for using artificial intelligence and machine learning within city government. Doing this work within the structure of government was sometimes challenging, he said.“The diversity of tasks is a great challenge in doing something like AI policy, because it's not a one-size-fits-all thing. It's often very context-based,” said Parikh. “It's a much harder job than being an AI ethics researcher, I'll tell you that.”Prior AI-focused initiatives, like a task force convened in 2017 to shape algorithmic policy, have run into bureaucratic roadblocks like a lack of transparency around what automated decision-making was currently being used by the city.Parikh left the job in 2021, just before mayor Eric Adams took office and consolidated the city’s tech agencies under the newly formed Office of Technology and Innovation. The Adams-era office is now “responsible for operating, maintaining, and securing IT infrastructure and systems that touch every aspect of City life,” according to the job description. Under this new office, Foard says the director will have more oversight over AI initiatives, and will be expected to be the “citywide subject matter expert” on the technology and its responsible use. The city is looking for someone with the technical expertise required who can also understand the “business value” of the technology, he said. There’s at least one candidate who says it’s ready to do the job: ChatGPT. “I would work to ensure that AI is used in a responsible and ethical manner to benefit all New Yorkers,” the chatbot promised, when prompted to write a cover letter for the role. “I would also collaborate with other city agencies, academic institutions, and industry partners to promote innovation and develop cutting-edge solutions to the city’s most pressing problems.”Alas, the agency plans to hire a human.LinkCopy LinkSarah Holder is a writer for CityLab in New York, focused on urban politics, housing, and work.Plus FollowingPlus Get AlertsPlus Get AlertsTwitterFacebookTwitterLinkedInEmailLinkGiftBookmarkSaveHave a confidential tip for our reporters?

Mere months after its last large-scale layoff, Meta is putting another set of jobs on the chopping block. The parent company of Facebook and Instagram will cut thousands of employees as soon as this week, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The report was confirmed on March 14, when Meta announced layoffs affecting about 10,000 people, or 13% of its workforce, in another round of job cuts. The announcement was posted on the company’s website in a message titled “Update on Meta’s Year of Efficiency.”

Since mid-2022, Meta has been struggling to reel back costs. It spent too much, too quickly, on its big metaverse dreams while ad revenue slid due to a macroeconomic downturn and increased competition. A $12-a-month subscription for blue ticks won’t be enough to make up for it all.

A brief timeline of Meta’s jobs shuffle

November 2022: Meta trimmed its workforce by 13% last November, when it slashed 11,000 roles to save costs and increase efficiency. It was the first time since Facebook was founded 18 years ago that the company announced mass layoffs.

January 2023: Meta rescinds full-time offers made to a “small number of candidates” while it readjusts hiring priorities—a cut of this kind is a first for the company. Engineer and writer Gergely Orosz tweeted that the decision affected around 20 new grads in London with offers due to start in February.

February 2023: Meta starts “flattening” its organizational structure, asking managers and directors to transition to individual contributor jobs—non-managerial posts focused on coding, designing and research—or leave. It also delays setting team budgets as it plans a fresh round of layoffs.

Culling the Metaverse

Besides all the payrolls, there’s another massive black hole that’s been sucking Meta’s money: the metaverse.

Just after the pandemic, when everyone was working, living, and breathing online, Zuckerbeg floated the metaverse as the next big thing and touted Facebook as its leader. He went all in to create an immersive world that can be accessed through virtual reality (VR) headsets and special glasses—albeit a slightly creepy world of floating torsos. It led to a brand and name change, and gobbled up billions of dollars in investment.

But it didn’t quite catch on.

Nobody used Horizon Worlds, the social universe that was quickly dismissed as a poor quality video game despite Zuckerberg’s insistence that it was more. In making it accessible, Meta made it subpar. And if Zuckerberg thought he could tap into the 13- to 17-year-old market to make the product work, he has to think again. US Senators are opposing the move to open the platform to teens.

Zuckerberg is quietly killing the metaverse and pivoting to a “new top-level product group at Meta focused on generative AI to turbocharge our work in this area,” as he wrote in a Feb. 27 Facebook post—the same day OpenAI teased dialogue-based ChatGPT. The team building AI-powered products is led by Ahmad Al-Dahle, who’ll report to Facebook Meta’s chief product officer Chris Cox.

Facebook’s focus on ChatGPT-like AI 

Last month, on Feb. 24, the company introduced a new large language model called LLaMA, short for Large Language Model Meta AI. It’s the core software of a new artificial intelligence system, which entails mining vast amounts of text in order to summarize information and generate content.

“In the short term, we’ll focus on building creative and expressive tools. Over the longer term, we’ll focus on developing AI personas that can help people in a variety of ways,” Zuckerberg wrote in his post.

For now, the most pronounced remnant of that remains of the metaverse is the hardware–the headsets—meant for enthusiasts like gamers and crypto fans. 

Quotable: Meta messed up the Metaverse mission

“It’s just flabbergasting to me that people with so many resources can so spectacularly mess things up when the opportunity to do something cool is there,” -Celia Pearce, a professor of game design at Northeastern who has been studying non-game virtual worlds since the mid-1990s, on the Metaverse failure

$24 billion: Cumulative loss amassed by Reality Labs, the division housing metaverse projects, in 2021 and 2022. Of this, $13.7 billion was last year’s loss, which grew from the year before.

“About 80%...a little more”: Meta’s investments going towards the core business, namely its family of apps—Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and the ads business associated with that. 

“A little less than 20%”: Meta’s investment goes towards Reality Labs, as told to The New York Times Dealbook conference last November.

$562 billion: The current market cap of the once trillion dollar company Meta

275%: How much more expensive Meta’s Quest Pro VR headset was that its predecessor Quest 2 at $1,500 when it launched five months ago

$1,000: The price of Meta’s Quest Pro VR headset fell 33% in the US and Canada as of Sunday (Mar. 5) as Meta brings it in line with competitors like HTC Vive XR Elite. By March 15, other markets are due to follow suit

$30: The difference between the low-end, 128GB version of the Quest 2 headset at $400 and the expanded-storage 256GB Quest 2 headset, which is now retailing at $430 instead of $500 

20 million: Units of the Quest line sold to date, but how often are they being used? Meta Vice President for VR Mark Rabkin reportedly told employees that “the newer cohorts that are coming in…they’re just not as into it.” Maybe the thinner 2024 variant at “the most attractive price point in the VR consumer market” will make it more popular.

LinkedIn Launches Generative AI Writing Assistant for Profiles and Job Descriptions



Eric Hal Schwartz  on March 16, 2023 at 8:00 am

LinkedIn has introduced generative AI writing tools to help users put together their personal profiles and create job descriptions. The social media platform has also curated a collection of 100 courses on AI for LinkedIn Learning, with another 20 specifically covering generative AI.
LinkedIn Storytelling
LinkedIn is using two different versions of OpenAI’s large language models for its new features. The job descriptions rely on GPT-3.5, while the profiles employ the brand new GPT-4 model. The profile help is only available for LinkedIn Premium subscribers right now, but any recruiter can use the job description assistant. Recruiters fill in basic details about the job, including the title and the company hiring for the role, and the AI then offers a job description to review and post. Users struggling to describe themselves on LinkedIn can use the new personal profile AI to construct a narrative about themselves. The AI will pick out experiences and skills to showcase, then write a headline and an about section to match.
“Maintaining your authenticity and using the content already on your profile, our tool identifies the most important skills and experiences to highlight in your About and Headline sections and crafts suggestions to make your profile stand out. By doing the heavy lifting for you, the tool saves you time and energy while still maintaining your unique voice and style,” LinkedIn chief product officerTomer Cohen said. ” One thing that will always stay our guiding principle: How can we use AI — or any other technology — to help you connect to economic opportunities? Everything we do at LinkedIn starts there.”
Generative Muse
LinkedIn’s tools are narrowly tailored to the social media platform’s needs, but the idea of supporting writing tasks with generative AI is very popular. Similar tools are almost a standard feature now for any software or app that supports or requires written content. For instance, Grammarly recently released its new GrammarlyGO tools based on precisely that concept. OpenAI and rivals like Jasper have created APIs to further extend their offerings in the space. The new Notion AI assistant, website creator Wix, and graphic design platform Canva all count AI writing assistance powered by a mix of generative AI APIs among their features. Not to mention the writing-specific generative AI companies like Regie. Google even jumped on the trend this week with generative text tools for Google Docs and Gmail.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly evolved in recent years, becoming a valuable tool for businesses to streamline operations, reduce production costs, and meet company objectives. In 2023, AI will play an increasingly vital role in leadership decision-making, with predictive analytics, natural language processing, and more.


The Role of AI in Today’s Workplace

Whereas digital technology was once a source of leisure, it is now the very means by which society functions on an everyday basis.

We live in a time of exponential growth, with technological advances becoming more fundamental than ever to today’s workplace. According to recent findings, 35% of businesses already use AI, with 42% of companies considering implementing AI in the future.

PROMOTED
At the most basic level, AI-driven scheduling software helps businesses reduce the time and resources required to manage staffing. How can companies further leverage AI this year to better achieve their goals?
The Benefits of AI-Informed Leadership
Most businesses require repetitive tasks that take up valuable time and resources, such as data entry and invoicing. By implementing AI solutions, companies can free employees to focus on higher-level tasks requiring more critical thinking and creativity.

Predictive analytics is a branch of artificial intelligence that uses data mining, machine learning, and statistical algorithms to analyze current and historical data to make predictions about future events or trends. By identifying patterns in data, predictive analytics can help businesses make more informed decisions about everything from inventory management to customer behavior.

Businesses use predictive analytics to forecast demand for particular products based on past sales data and market trends. Predictive analytics help companies optimize their production and inventory levels to avoid stockouts, ultimately reducing costs and improving profitability.
Natural Language Processing
Natural language processing (NLP) is another branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on understanding and interpreting human language. NLP algorithms analyze text data to extract meaning, sentiment, and intent. This enables businesses to understand customer feedback better, automate customer service interactions, and generate personalized content.
Businesses might use NLP algorithms to analyze customer feedback on social media to identify common issues and trends. NLP algorithms can help companies address these issues proactively, improving overall customer experience.
Fraud Detection
Fraud is a significant concern for businesses, as it leads to financial loss and legal consequences, not to mention the reputational damage fraud can inflict. Fraud is also challenging to detect, especially when it’s sophisticated and targeted.
In addition to machine learning, behavior analysis, and natural language processing, AI is also effective in analyzing large amounts of data to identify anomalies or patterns that deviate from the norm. AI can help identify potential fraudulent activity, such as unusual spending patterns or transactions. AI can also analyze user networks, which helps identify possible fraud rings and block access to prevent further fraudulent activity.
How Leaders Can Leverage AI Initiatives to Improve Decision-Making
Successful implementation of AI requires strategy and collaboration between various stakeholders, and business leaders play a critical role in driving the success of those initiatives.
Leaders and executives must be proactive in allocating sufficient funding, attracting and developing the right talent, collaborating and partnering with other organizations, and considering the ethical implications. Here are some key ways leaders can begin leveraging AI initiatives to improve decision-making:
1. Vision and Strategy
Leaders must first understand AI’s potential benefits and risks and how it fits into the business strategy. Leaders must communicate intentions and goals to the organization and garner support from stakeholders, ensuring that everyone shares the same vision.
2. Investment and Funding
Executives must then allocate sufficient resources, and not just when it comes to funding. Finding and fostering the right talent and ensuring the company has the right technology infrastructure are both necessary for AI initiatives to succeed. As a result, many leaders hire data analysts, AI engineers, and other specialists who can design, develop, and deploy AI systems.
3. Collaboration and Partnership
Leaders can collaborate with other organizations, including technology vendors and research institutions, to stay up-to-date with the latest AI trends and innovations.
4. Ethical Considerations
Consider the ethical implications of AI: issues related to data privacy, bias, and transparency. Leaders must ensure that AI systems are developed and used responsibly, with appropriate controls and safeguards in place.
5. Managing Change
Understand that implementing AI initiatives also drives organizational change. Leaders should prepare to be in consistent dialogue with stakeholders about the progress of their AI initiatives. They should also prepare training and support for everyone involved in AI implementation, including managing teams who may be resistant to organizational change.
AI rapidly transforms businesses across industries. Organizations that successfully leverage AI can gain a competitive edge in an unstable and confusing market. By leveraging AI to inform leadership decision-making, companies can improve accuracy, reduce errors, and optimize their operations, leading to better outcomes and increased profitability. As AI technology continues to evolve and become more sophisticated, we can expect to see even more significant improvements in accuracy and productivity in the workplace.

AI-generated art can be copyrighted, say US officials – with a catch

Some non-artificial intelligence needed




Katyanna Quach                                



Thu 16 Mar 2023                                     // 
23:54 UTC                                



































The US Copyright Office will consider an AI-generated work copyrightable if a human can prove they themselves put a meaningful amount of creative effort into the final content, according to a policy published on Thursday.
AI software capable of automatically generating images or text from an input prompt or instruction has made it easier for people to churn out content. Correspondingly, the USCO has received an increasing number of applications to register copyright protections for material, especially artwork, created using such tools.
US law states that intellectual property can be copyrighted only if it was the product of human creativity, and the USCO only acknowledges work authored by humans at present. Machines and generative AI algorithms, therefore, cannot be authors, and their outputs are not copyrightable. 







Digital art, poems, and books generated using tools like DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, ChatGPT, or even the newly released GPT-4 will not be protected by copyright if they were created by humans using only a text description or prompt, USCO director Shira Perlmutter warned. 











""If a work's traditional elements of authorship were produced by a machine, the work lacks human authorship and the Office will not register it,"" she wrote in a document outlining copyright guidelines.
""For example, when an AI technology receives solely a prompt from a human and produces complex written, visual, or musical works in response, the 'traditional elements of authorship' are determined and executed by the technology – not the human user. 







""Instead, these prompts function more like instructions to a commissioned artist – they identify what the prompter wishes to have depicted, but the machine determines how those instructions are implemented in its output.""

The USCO will consider content created using AI if a human author has crafted something beyond the machine's direct output. A digital artwork that was formed from a prompt, and then edited further using Photoshop, for example, is more likely to be accepted by the office. The initial image created using AI would not be copyrightable, but the final product produced by the artist might be.
Thus it would appear the USCO is simply saying: yes, if you use an AI-powered application to help create something, you have a reasonable chance at applying for copyright, just as if you used non-AI software. If it's purely machine-made from a prompt, you need to put some more human effort into it.
In a recent case, officials registered a copyright certificate for a graphic novel containing images created using Midjourney. The overall composition and words were protected by copyright since they were selected and arranged by a human, but the individual images themselves were not.
""In the case of works containing AI-generated material, the Office will consider whether the AI contributions are the result of 'mechanical reproduction' or instead of an author's 'own original mental conception, to which [the author] gave visible form'. The answer will depend on the circumstances, particularly how the AI tool operates and how it was used to create the final work. This is necessarily a case-by-case inquiry,"" the USCO declared.


Perlmutter urged people applying for copyright protection for any material generated using AI to state clearly how the software was used to create the content, and show which parts of the work were created by humans. If they fail to disclose this information accurately, or try to hide the fact it was generated by AI, USCO will cancel their certificate of registration and their work may not be protected by copyright law. ® Sponsored: Don’t be complacent on cybersecurity resilience

There’s a common perception that artificial intelligence will help streamline our work. There are even fears that it could wipe out the need for some jobs altogether.But in a study of science laboratories I carried out with three colleagues at the University of Manchester, the introduction of automated processes that aim to simplify work – and free people’s time – can also make that work more complex, generating new tasks that many workers might perceive as mundane.In the study, published in Research Policy, we looked at the work of scientists in a field called synthetic biology, or synbio for short. Synbio is concerned with redesigning organisms to have new abilities. It is involved in growing meat in the lab, in new ways of producing fertilisers and in the discovery of new drugs.Synbio experiments rely on advanced, robotic platforms to repetitively move a large number of samples. They also use machine learning to analyse the results of large-scale experiments.These, in turn, generate large amounts of digital data. This process is known as “digitalisation”, where digital technologies are used to transform traditional methods and ways of working.Some of the key objectives of automating and digitalising scientific processes are to scale up the science that can be done while saving researchers time to focus on what they would consider more “valuable” work.Paradoxical resultHowever, in our study, scientists were not released from repetitive, manual or boring tasks as one might expect. Instead, the use of robotic platforms amplified and diversified the kinds of tasks researchers had to perform. There are several reasons for this.Among them is the fact that the number of hypotheses (the scientific term for a testable explanation for some observed phenomenon) and experiments that needed to be performed increased. With automated methods, the possibilities are amplified.Scientists said it allowed them to evaluate a greater number of hypotheses, along with the number of ways that scientists could make subtle changes to the experimental set-up. This had the effect of boosting the volume of data that needed checking, standardising and sharing.Also, robots needed to be “trained” in performing experiments previously carried out manually. Humans, too, needed to develop new skills for preparing, repairing, and supervising robots. This was done to ensure there were no errors in the scientific process.Scientific work is often judged on output such as peer-reviewed publications and grants. However, the time taken to clean, troubleshoot and supervise automated systems competes with the tasks traditionally rewarded in science. These less valued tasks may also be largely invisible – particularly because managers are the ones who would be unaware of mundane work due to not spending as much time in the lab.The synbio scientists carrying out these responsibilities were not better paid or more autonomous than their managers. They also assessed their own workload as being higher than those above them in the job hierarchy.Wider lessonsIt’s possible these lessons might apply to other areas of work too. ChatGPT is an AI-powered chatbot that “learns” from information available on the web. When prompted by questions from online users, the chatbot offers answers that appear well-crafted and convincing.According to Time magazine, in order for ChatGPT to avoid returning answers that were racist, sexist or offensive in other ways, workers in Kenya were hired to filter toxic content delivered by the bot.There are many often invisible work practices needed for the development and maintenance of digital infrastructure. This phenomenon could be described as a “digitalisation paradox”. It challenges the assumption that everyone involved or affected by digitalisation becomes more productive or has more free time when parts of their workflow are automated.Concerns over a decline in productivity are a key motivation behind organisational and political efforts to automate and digitalise everyday work. But we should not take promises of gains in productivity at face value.Instead, we should challenge the ways we measure productivity by considering the invisible types of tasks humans can accomplish, beyond the more visible work that is usually rewarded.We also need to consider how to design and manage these processes so that technology can more positively add to human capabilities.Barbara Ribeiro is Associate professor in innovation management and policy, SKEMA Business School and Honorary Lecturer, University of Manchester.This article first appeared on The Conversation.

The tech giant plans to integrate its office products with generative AI that can do things like generate an entire document or create images based on a prompt. Workers will be able to access these capabilities by clicking a new wand icon that’ll appear in their apps.Google plans to begin rolling out some features, starting with writing functions in Google Docs and Gmail, to select enterprise customers within the next couple of weeks, it said. It’s unclear when other features may become available.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementGoogle comes in a far second to Microsoft Office when it comes to workplace productivity tools, according to market research firm Gartner. Open AI created a lot of buzz last year after rolling out its text-based generative AI tool ChatGPT, which Microsoft integrated into its search engine Bing this year. Since then, workers have been experimenting with whether ChatGPT can aid with work tasks. But experts advise people to be cautious when using the tech for work, as generative AI can produce content that’s factually incorrect, doesn’t make sense, is similar or almost identical to an unknown source, or, in the case of images, is visibly contorted.💻Follow TechnologyFollowTo be sure, Google has integrated artificial intelligence — like the predictive text element in Gmail — into its software for years. But Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud, characterized the latest AI announcements as the next phase of development, in which humans will be supported by AI collaborators. Google said it will collect the interaction data customers input and receive to improve its tech for initial test customers.Here are some of the ways workers may be able to use the new Workspace AI integrations, according to the information  Google provided.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementWriting documents and emailsGoogle’s generative AI will be able to produce an entire draft based off a topic or set of bullet points for workers who need help getting words on the page, whether that’s in an email or a Google Doc.A marketing manager might ask the tech to create a sales training plan for the next campaign, and Google Docs  would generate one from scratch, for example. Workers can also highlight portions of text and ask Google’s AI to rewrite them in a specific tone. For example, they could use commands like “Make this more formal” or “Make this whimsical.” If you don’t like the first result, the “view another” button is expected to produce another one. And if you don’t know what tone you want to use, you will be able to click “I’m feeling lucky,” and Google will choose one for you.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe AI will be able to summarize email threads with a prompt like “Catch me up on this email conversation.” Or it could create a brief based on several Google documents or emails. Google expects it to also allow users to help prioritize emails.Create images and presentations quicklyWorkers may be able to soon use AI capabilities to cut down the time it takes to create a presentation in Google Slides.Users are expected to be able to prompt the app, a competitor to Microsoft’s PowerPoint, to create images for a specific slide. Google says it also expects to allow workers to create AI-generated audio or video to embed in their slides, but it didn’t have more details to share.Autofill some of your spreadsheetsWhen it comes to spreadsheets, workers are expected use AI to help complete filling them out faster or understand their data.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementIn Sheets, Google’s spreadsheet app, AI is expected to help generate formulas, offer analysis and insights, and categorize data. For example, in a spreadsheet that has a column for personalized messages to customers, the AI could automatically fill in the blanks for every customer with one prompt.Make chats and meetings more productiveGoogle also wants to help workers make their communications with peers more productive and efficient.On Google Meet, workers are expected to be able to automatically track meeting notes, create checklists for action items and summarize the meeting. The features are expansions from statements the company made last year when it announced transcriptions for Meet as well as summaries of conversations in its group chat platform, Spaces.Google also expects to integrate AI into Google Chat to allow workers to automate some workflows.  It didn’t have any more details to share about that future feature.Help Desk: Making tech work for youHelp Desk is a destination built for readers looking to better understand and take control of the technology used in everyday life.Take control: Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter to get straight talk and advice on how to make your tech a force for good.Tech tips to make your life easier: 10 tips and tricks to customize iOS 16 | 5 tips to make your gadget batteries last longer | How to get back control of a hacked social media account | How to avoid falling for and spreading misinformation onlineData and Privacy: A guide to every privacy setting you should change now.

However, it’s important to remember that AI isn’t – and may never be – a replacement for human intelligence. Understanding this means learning its limits and recognizing the situations where human skills, knowledge, judgment, and creativity are still vital.

Learning how to use this powerful new technology to augment our own capabilities while freeing up our time to focus on more challenging, higher-value work will be a key workplace skill for many professionals in the age of AI.

PROMOTED
First, what is ChatGPT?
For those of you who may not have tried – or even heard of – ChatGPT yet, firstly, what’s it like living on Mars? Secondly, the Cliff’s Notes version is that it’s a conversational interface (or chatbot) that understands and generates human languages. Think Alexa or Siri but far more advanced and capable of handling much more complex inquiries and responses.

It’s an example of ""generative AI"" because it can use existing data to generate new outputs, ranging from poetry and fiction to emails, essays, blog posts, and even computer code. ChatGPT was created by Open AI, which is funded by a number of technology and venture capital firms, most prominently Microsoft, who recently invested $10 billion and are integrating it into their Bing search engine. To get a little more technical, ChatGPT itself is actually a user interface (UI) for OpenAI’s large language model, called GPT-3. It was trained on a dataset consisting of over 175 billion pieces of information, including web pages, books, and articles in many different languages.

How Can Professionals Supercharge Their Abilities With ChatGPT and Generative AI?


1/1

Continue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE
A recent guest on my webinar was Dominic Allon, CEO of cloud CRM solutions provider Pipedrive. Discussing how professionals and businesses will integrate generative AI into their work, he told me, ""It's helpful to reflect on how previous [technological advancements] have been integrated into the way we get work done.
“Sam Altman, CEO of Open AI, often uses the example of a calculator – how does a calculator change the way we figure out math problems and teach math?
“It actually got integrated into the way we work quite quickly; My expectation is this new tool – this ability to generate text quickly in a foundational, quite generic but logical manner will get embedded quite quickly into the way we work.”
Many examples already exist of ways in which ChatGPT and related technologies can be used by professionals:
· Writers can use it to generate blogs, articles, and informational material.
· Teachers can use it to summarize educational material and create assignments.
· Financial professionals can automate bookkeeping and reporting.
· Lawyers can use it to summarize case law and quickly develop an understanding of areas of law that they have not previously studied.
· Marketers can use it to create ad copy and sales emails.
· Customer service agents can use it to generate responses to inquiries and compile FAQ documents on issues that are frequently raised.
· Healthcare professionals can use it to extract relevant information from medical records and examinations and compile reports and summaries of patient data.
Augment Your Skills With New Abilities
But that’s just the start. Crucially, professionals can use it to augment their abilities to carry out tasks that might happen to fall outside of their skillset or area of expertise.
For example, a data analyst might be good at drawing conclusions based on charts and statistics but not great at writing these up into reports for their colleagues. This is where generative AI can step in, lending a hand with day-to-day activities and enabling professionals to spend their time on tasks where their strength lies.
Conversely, a writer can use their analytical abilities to augment their written work with statistics, even if they aren’t great at statistical research and analysis themselves.
A teacher might be fantastic at drawing the best out of their students and encouraging them to achieve their potential in exams but not enjoy the process of creating lesson plans or designing learning material. They can put generative AI to work to fill in the blanks in their skillset and become a more rounded, capable professional.
And a computer programmer might instinctively know how to use their programming language of choice but find it hard to explain what their code is doing to a non-coder. Generative AI can annotate code and create human-language explanations of what’s happening under the hood (and even spot bugs they might have missed.)
As Allon puts it, “What this will do is free up those professionals to do two things … firstly to be more efficient and effective, and to own a wider scope of work. And secondly to [focus on] a higher level of cognitive tasks.”
One example comes from his previous career at QuickBooks. Allon told me that once automated tools were in place to handle routine tasks such as reconciling transactions, accountants have been able to spend more time working directly with clients and developing their role as “trusted advisors” within their own organizations or with clients.
""The other point here,"" he continues, ""is the role we all play in our different fields … will continue to be critically important because typically ChatGPT will offer up a fairly generic answer, and it's always the case that you'll have to augment that with a particular point of view, or the right tone and style for your company, so for me it’s about this combination of ‘better together’”.
The Way Forward
So, to summarize, there are three steps that we need to consider if we want to transform ourselves into supercharged, AI-augmented professionals. The first is to think about how AI can automate the routine and repetitive tasks we do every day.
Then we need to consider how it might expand our abilities and allow us to take on challenges that previously might have had us stumped or turning to others for help.
Last but by no means least, we need to think about how we can use the time we've freed up by harnessing generative AI to spend more time on truly human tasks. This means face-to-face time with clients, customers, and colleagues, as well as high-level strategic tasks, creative tasks, and work that requires us to come up with genuinely new ideas.
Taking this step-by-step approach is a great way to minimize our chances of being left behind by the AI revolution that's set to transform the world of work and make sure we’re in the best position to continue to add value.

Almost Half of Health Systems Use AI for Workforce Issues 


A survey shows that 47.5 percent of health systems currently use artificial intelligence solutions to address workforce challenges, with the rest considering an AI solution for this purpose.

With support from Outbound AI, the Health Management Academy (the Academy) conducted a survey showing that due to common staffing issues within health systems, many C-suite executives are using artificial intelligence (AI) for back office and clinical operations.







In healthcare, problems surrounding staffing and labor insufficiencies have grown immensely, particularly over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. To compensate for this issue, health systems are increasingly turning to AI.
To gather insights into the state of AI and its utility in addressing workforce issues, the Academy used quantitative survey and qualitative interview methods, polling 40 executives from 40 leading health systems. According to researchers, all involved in the survey were deemed to have a relatively high level of familiarity with AI.
According to the survey, the portion of executives that currently use AI for workforce challenges is just under half (47.5 percent). But the rest (52.5 percent) noted that their health system is considering the implementation of AI for this reason.
It also noted that the order in which AI investments are generally prioritized is back-office processes, clinical operations, and clinical care.
Encompassing revenue cycle, human resources, and supply chain management, back-office processes commonly involve human errors. According to the survey, 78 percent of executives claim that their health systems are either actively using or considering AI for revenue cycle management.
The report also revealed that conversational AI is growing popular among providers. Described as a tool that uses advanced automation, AI, and natural language processing to comprehend human language, conversational AI is currently being used by 27.5 percent of health systems, and 72.5 percent are considering using it.
Additionally, nursing is being targeted for AI investment. According to survey data, 15 percent of executives indicated that their health system is using AI for nursing. However, 82.5 percent stated that their health system is considering its use for this purpose.
Regarding investments, researchers noted that growth appeared likely in the next one to three years. Among those who claimed their health system uses AI for workforce issues, 84.5 percent stated that they plan to increase their use of these solutions in the near future.
Further, in evaluating AI, particularly for revenue cycle management, the survey highlighted which factors executives focus on. These include interoperability with EHRs, privacy and security, the ability to augment EHR capabilities, expected return on investment, and anticipated value (hard and soft) over the course of a three-plus year period.
Additionally, executives leverage various sources when evaluating AI solutions, including existing technologies and partnerships, recommendations from peers, and assessments of successful use cases and real-world return on investment data.
Similarly, a survey from December 2021 found that many healthcare executives were considering AI use to improve patient outcomes, support cost savings, and promote health equity.
The fourth annual Optum Survey on AI in Healthcare included responses from 500 senior healthcare executives from hospitals, health plans, and life sciences companies. Almost all (96 percent) believed AI is critical to achieving health equality goals.
The survey also indicated that 85 percent of health leaders noted that they had an AI strategy at the time, with 48 percent already starting one.

SINGAPORE: Imagine Monet in the modern world – using artificial intelligence (AI), he’s created thousands more of his famous water lilies paintings. But who owns them – Monet or the AI? 
The question about copyright and AI artwork has hit headlines recently. Last week, Japan’s first fully AI-drawn manga hit the shelves.Advertisement 












ADVERTISEMENTThe author of the 100-page sci-fi manga, who admitted he has “absolutely zero” drawing talent, took just six weeks to finish the book. 
He entered text prompts – such as “pink hair” and “Asian boy” – in the programme to conjure images of the protagonist.
Last month, the US Copyright Office ruled that images in the graphic novel Zarya of the Dawn – which was created using the AI system Midjourney – should not have been granted copyright.
The decision was one of the first by a US court about copyright protection for works created by AI.
In Singapore, the law holds no mention of whether AI-generated works have copyright. CNA looks at how artists are using AI to create new pieces and the concerns around protecting their work.Advertisement 












AI ART
With AI becoming increasingly mainstream, local artists are experimenting with its uses.
Ms Wyn-Lyn Tan, a visual artist who currently has an exhibition along the Esplanade Tunnel, uses AI as a tool to develop her artistic practice.





      What is copyright?
  

Copyright protects the expression of ideas in tangible forms, according to the Intellectual Property Office in Singapore (IPOS).
“When you own the copyright to a work, you control the use and commercial exploitation of these works. This means that you have the right to prevent others from reproducing, publishing, performing, communicating to the public, or adapting to your work,” said IPOS on its website.
Examples of works protected under copyright law include literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works.
The main objective for copyright can be summarised in three things: Rewarding and recognising authors, incentivising the creation of new works and benefiting society through creative works.
In Singapore, an author is automatically granted copyright protection as soon as they create and express their work in a tangible form. No registration is required.

Her exhibition features an installation of 20 paintings and six generative AI video works. 
To create AI art pieces, Ms Tan feeds “thousands of images"" of her own paintings into the machine learning programme, which generates new art based on her old pieces.
“This digital platform kind of pushed me to think about how I could use it as a tool to extend my language of painting,” she added. Advertisement 












Mr Lim Wui-Liang, who uses the AI tool Midjourney for his project titled AI Art News, describes it as “fast, fun and intoxicating”. 
The 43-year-old tech employee said the difference between art and AI-generated art is the “speed at which it is produced”. 
“It would be impossible for me to create some of the pieces on AI Art News by myself. But with AI, anything that I envision in my head can be generated in mere seconds,” said Mr Lim.

AUTHORSHIP AND ORIGINALITY
As the use of AI programmes like ChatGPT become normalised, the law has yet to fully catch up with the implications of such use.
“There is presently no legal definition for AI art,” said lawyer Ronald Wong, director at Covenant Chambers.Advertisement 












“I would describe it as AI-generated works. The term ‘works’ does not assume it is artistic or art, and includes a range of forms including image, design, music, and videos.”
The law does not have any specific rules on AI-generated works, explained Mr Wong, who handles legal disputes around tech and intellectual property among others.
It is unclear if AI-generated artworks will be protected by copyright. The main issues are authorship and originality.
“One legal view is that AI-generated works are produced with no human authorship whereas traditional art is created by human authors. Human authorship is required for copyright to arise,” said Mr Wong.
“Originality is also a requirement for copyright. It is argued that without human authors, there is no originality.” 
In 2016, Dr Stephen Thaler – who generated the artwork A Recent Entrance To Paradise using an AI system he created – was denied copyright registration. A US judge ruled that artificial intelligence cannot get a patent for its creations, ruling that such a privilege is reserved for people.
Professor David Tan, co-director of the Centre for Technology, Robotics, Artificial Intelligence and the Law at the National University of Singapore, breaks down AI’s role in generating artwork and compares it to traditional tools.
Copyright law typically views art as an intellectual creation – a product of the human mind or human creativity.
""Whatever you use to produce your art are just tools to assist the humans who create the work, like when you use acrylic on canvas to paint, or when using a piano to compose music. So AI, no matter how sophisticated, when used as a tool, is similar to all these traditional tools,"" said Prof Tan.

Commentary: Is it considered art when artists use AI to produce books and images?













Ms Tan said her pieces made with AI belong to her, not the programme because it generates pieces only from what she feeds into it – her own paintings. She said she thinks of the machine ""simply as a tool"".
""One cannot exist without the other ... the programme is actually learning to mimic my artistic style in order to generate this stream of unique digital artworks,” she told CNA.
“Without me curating and inputting my images, the machine learning programme will not be able to get to a point where they churn out a work that I feel is me.
“I’m actually doing a lot of post-programme editing on my own because it’s still an artistic medium. So I’m not just simply spitting it out with the programme.""
She added: “I think when one of my physical, traditional collectors look at my digital artwork, they can say ‘oh, that’s a Wyn-Lyn Tan’.""
Similarly, Mr Lim does not leave AI to do all the work.
Inspired by news headlines for his art, Mr Lim identifies a story and constructs the image by “running through various types of art, iconography and pop culture”. 
“I break down this image into prompts which I feed into Midjourney. The first set of images generated usually doesn’t make the cut,” he said.
“I’ll refine my prompts and re-generate again, repeating this process until I get an image I’m happy with. More often than not, there are more hits than misses.”

SHOULD COPYRIGHT LAWS CHANGE?
The keywords remain when looking at whether an artwork can be protected by law – authorship and originality.
Even though artists are clear about the role they play in their art, some AI works remain unprotected by copyright law.
“I wouldn’t advocate that we recognise autonomous AI-generated work,” Prof Tan said.
He explained that no country has recognised autonomous AI-generated work and Singapore needs not be the first to do so. 
Even in countries like England where copyright protection is available for computer-generated works, the courts still require the identification of the author as a person who had completed the arrangements necessary for the creation of the work. 
“There is a lot of noise out there and it’s really people just wanting to take extreme positions so they get more media coverage. The fundamentals of copyright laws protect only human creativity,"" he said.
When considering whether copyright has been infringed, Prof Tan said the court will decide if enough of an artwork is copied, by looking at its protectable features. 
Ideas are not protected expressions, he added. 
Taking Monet as an example, his style of painting is “not a copyrightable expression”, but Monet’s particular perspective of the water lilies in a painting would be considered a protected feature, explained the professor. This would allow other artists to paint water lilies in a pond in a different way or from a different point of view. 
Mr Wong said that there are situations where artists can take legal action. He advised creators to leave “deliberate fingerprints or symbolic signatures”.
“As long as there is substantial copying and there is a causal link between the copyrighted work and AI-generated work, there would be copyright infringement,” he explained.
“As to who would be sued, that would depend on the technical details of how the AI-generated work is produced.”
But he pointed to the other side of the legal debate, which views certain AI-generated works to have human authors and originality.
“In particular, AI-generated works created based on certain input of a human can be said to engage the human intellect and thus fulfil the authorship and originality requirements for copyright to arise,” he said.

Mr Lim said AI artwork should be covered by copyright law, but it may be challenging.
“Some people may argue that since AI art infringes on the copyright of many artists because it draws on their work, it is not an original piece of art or is not eligible for copyright. Or that because AI art is produced by a machine, it cannot be copyrighted,” he said.
“But the initial creative vision – that spark – came from a human.”
He feels that the law has to protect not only AI artists but also artists whose work AI draws from.
“It has to be a two-way street … we need to start accepting AI artists as creators in their own right and we need to find a way for AI to ethically train on other artworks.”
WHAT NEXT AS AI BECOMES MORE MAINSTREAM?
Ms Tan is not worried about her pieces being stolen by AI, but admits it “is kind of scary”. She said she will continue to incorporate AI into her work.
""I am still excited about using AI as a way to extend my painting practice and my painting language. If it fits the concept of whatever it is I wish to be saying with my artwork, I would still be using AI,"" she added.
Mr Lim told CNA he feels “a bit uncomfortable” that his works are not safeguarded under copyright law but said that both physical art pieces and AI works “can be easily stolen by anyone if they really want to”.
At the end of the day it’s all about the integrity of the artists, said Ms Tan.
She added: “Of course, as an artist, I would really be glad for specific copyright rules but at the end of the day, who is able to police all this?”

SINGAPORE — An “employee” who can generate innovative marketing ideas, edit and craft proposals within seconds and perhaps, best of all, is willing to work for free.
For Ms Jane Neo, chief business officer and co-founder of maternity and baby products retailer KeaBabies, these are the attributes of ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence (AI) tool by OpenAI that has taken the world by storm in recent months.Advertisement 












She is among a number of Singapore bosses and workers who have been quick to embrace ChatGPT at work, with some caveats, while others remain decidedly wary of introducing the technology into the workplace.






 “ 

    We have even provided a tutorial on how to effectively utilise ChatGPT in specific areas of our work. We believe that it is a valuable tool that can help our employees work more efficiently and effectively.
              
          Ms Jane Neo, chief business officer and co-founder of KeaBabies
        

”







Ms Neo said: “We have introduced ChatGPT to our employees and strongly encourage its use in the workplace for all relevant tasks except for website SEO (search engine optimisation) content."" Search engines penalise AI written content.""
She also said: “We have even provided a tutorial on how to effectively utilise ChatGPT in specific areas of our work. We believe that it is a valuable tool that can help our employees work more efficiently and effectively.”
In a Reuters news article last month, it was reported that the chatbot reached about 100 million monthly active users within just two months of being launched in November last year.

Employers and employees in Singapore interviewed by TODAY said that they often use it to come up with ideas and for copywriting. They are still exploring other ways to use ChatGPT for work.
One company that has recently jumped on the rise of ChatGPT is real estate firm ERA Singapore, which integrated the commercial version of the product — GPT-3 — into its in-house processes.Advertisement 












Since March 7, real estate agents at the firm have been using the GPT-3 function to perform administrative tasks such as copywriting, social media content generation, crafting of emails and making property listings, through a mobile application to which all employees have access.
Mr Marcus Chu, chief executive officer of Apac Realty and ERA Asia Pacific, told TODAY: “Ultimately, it is a tool to make (agents) more efficient by saving their time.”
Companies in the creative industry have also hopped onto the AI bandwagon, such as video game publisher Ubisoft Singapore.
Mr Darryl Long, managing director of the firm, said that the company’s designers use in-house AI tools to design and develop games.

“Using AI supports our level designers to iterate faster, without interrupting their creative thought process, thereby allowing them to spend more time on high-value tasks.Advertisement 












“The AI tools manage to reduce the time taken to rebuild our game worlds from about three hours to a mere 13 seconds.” 
SOME BOSSES WARY OF CHATGPT'S SHORTCOMINGS
However, employers in industries where writing is central to the business may have a different take on using ChatGPT for work.






 “ 

    There are a lot of positives to ChatGPT, particularly in background research... But it cannot substitute for original writing. I have sent an advisory to my employees not to use ChatGPT in their writing beyond search queries.
              
          Dr Juliana Chan, chief executive officer of Wildtype Media Group
        

”







One example is Dr Juliana Chan, chief executive officer of media and publishing company Wildtype Media Group, who sets guidelines for her employees on the use of ChatGPT and is cautious about using it for clients’ projects. 
“There are a lot of positives to ChatGPT, particularly in background research and summarising large blocks of text. But it cannot substitute for original writing,"" she said.
""I have sent an advisory to my employees not to use ChatGPT in their writing beyond search queries.""Advertisement

      Tech rivals chase ChatGPT as AI race ramps up
  







Dr Chan added that the other reasons for disallowing the use of ChatGPT for writing projects include plagiarism concerns and the potential for generating inaccurate information.
“ChatGPT has a tendency to produce 'vanilla' or bland responses that don’t provide a unique perspective. There is no personality in its written output, which is why it cannot replace the creative element of a human being,” she said.
WORKERS EMBRACE CHATGPT, MINDFUL OF  LIMITATIONS
Employees, too, have been using ChatGPT for work, mainly for its editing and proofreading capacities. 
One is a civil servant in her 20s, who uses ChatGPT to edit her email and proposal drafts, and even compose case report drafts based on information that she feeds into the chatbot.
Speaking on the condition of anonymity, she said that her writing had significantly improved since she used it to proofread and edit her work.
“I use ChatGPT to write event proposals and case reports,"" she said.

      Commentary: The good, bad and unknowns of letting Singapore’s civil servants use ChatGPT
  







""Usually higher-ups don’t understand what I’m trying to propose in my programmes because they don’t work on the ground and they will call me to clarify what I mean. But after using ChatGPT, they call me less often and my supervisor also said that my writing is satisfactory.""
The young woman said that she also used ChatGPT for writing challenging case reports where there is a lot of information to digest.
""With ChatGPT, I just input all the data and it produces a clear, short and simple summary of the case.” 
However, she is still mindful of ChatGPT’s limitations and the negative perceptions of using technology such as ChatGPT for work.
“One flaw is that ChatGPT is not consistent. There are cases where the bot barely edits my emails so I have to do that myself. And if there are too many people using the bot, I will have to wait for about an hour before I can use it,” she said. 
For senior media analyst Muhammad Iylia Mohd Hutta, ChatGPT does more than copywriting.
The 27-year-old, whose job entails media trawling and data cleaning, uses the chatbot to produce basic coding formulas and to process data. 
“My role is to customise and create analytical reports for clients and to optimise workflow, which is where ChatGPT comes in,"" he said.
He added that his employer and colleagues encourage its use for work.
“My workplace is very flexible in using ChatGPT. Everyone uses it and there are no guidelines set in stone about how to use the bot. We just make sure to fact-check and not take its output at face value.”
He noted that ChatGPT does have its limitations but it does not hinder or affect his work. For example, the bot relies on historical data up to 2021 only, which may lead to outdated information, and may fabricate information. 






 “ 

    I think there is some sort of preconceived notion about using AI tools like ChatGPT for work — that it’s not your original idea and it’s plagiarism. And therefore, if you use it, you are not demonstrating competency in doing your job.
              
          A social worker, who asked to remain anonymous
        

”







Another employee, who is in social work and wanted to be anonymous, said that she uses ChatGPT for “literally everything”, from writing emails or WhatsApp messages or social reports to brainstorming ideas for programmes.
The social worker who is in her 20s uses the chatbot by inserting her draft into the bot and prompting it to edit and refine her ideas. 
“I love ChatGPT. It provides a more tailored response than Google Search and saves me a lot of time, especially on administrative duties,"" she said.
""This allows me to focus my attention on more important things like speaking to clients and stakeholders and case planning.” 
She added that she does not tell her colleagues or employer that she uses ChatGPT for work for fear of being seen as incompetent or plagiarising her work.
“I think there is some sort of preconceived notion about using AI tools like ChatGPT for work — that it’s not your original idea and it’s plagiarism. And therefore, if you use it, you are not demonstrating competency in doing your job.""
She added: ""I don’t think this is true. The bot just supports what I can and already do, it just makes my work faster and saves a lot of my time.”
Even before starting work, prospective employees can use ChatGPT to clean up their resume and boost their chances of securing a job.
Human resources analyst Adrian Tan said that people are already using the chatbot to draft and edit resumes and cover letters.
“The bot is especially helpful for those who are not natural good writers to meet the benchmark of a good prospective employee,"" he said. 
He added that companies, especially multinational corporations that receive many applicants, have already been using AI to filter out unsuitable hires and pick the “best fit” candidates.
APPLY ‘GOLDILOCKS RULE’ WHEN USING CHATGPT
When it comes to using ChatGPT in the workplace, Associate Professor Karin Avnit at the Singapore Institute of Technology said that one should apply the ""Goldilocks rule"" of not too much and not too little.
“This means we shouldn’t completely abandon ChatGPT, but also not go to the other end of using it for everything without caution,"" Assoc Prof Avnit said.
“Employers should be mindful of the need to train people to work with such tools well and understand ChatGPT’s strengths and limitations, so that employees can be productive in their work with these AI assistants.”
Mr Gerry Chng, risk advisory executive director at consultancy firm Deloitte, who specialises in cybersecurity and risk management, agreed.
He said that companies should learn how to adopt AI in their workflow processes.
“Companies that disregard the advancement of AI are putting themselves at a dangerous disadvantage of being left behind. This technology has the potential to change how we work and make work more efficient.” 
However, because ChatGPT has some limitations, such as providing output that is inaccurate or not factual, he recommended that companies and employers set guidelines for their staff members.
This includes not disclosing confidential information and always fact-checking ChatGPT's output.
""There should also be transparency, in the sense that employees should acknowledge that some parts of their work were generated by AI, if any,” he added.
