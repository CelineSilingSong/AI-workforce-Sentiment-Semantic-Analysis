Why It Matters		



Generative AI can boost worker productivity, but organizations must first establish a culture of accountability, reward peer training, and encourage role reconfiguration.

A new study on the impact of generative AI on highly skilled workers finds that when artificial intelligence is used within the boundary of its capabilities, it can improve a worker’s performance by as much as 40% compared with workers who don’t use it.

But when AI is used outside that boundary to complete a task, worker performance drops by an average of 19 percentage points.
The findings have implications not only for worker productivity but for organizations looking to successfully navigate what the researchers have termed the “jagged technological frontier” of AI — specifically, generative pretrained transformers (GPT), which produce text after being given prompts. Understanding the upper limits of AI’s abilities is imperative, particularly as those abilities continue to expand, the researchers write.
It’s important for managers to maintain awareness of this jagged frontier, said Harvard Business School’s Fabrizio Dell’Acqua, the lead author of the paper, because the researchers found that it was not obvious to highly skilled knowledge workers which of their everyday tasks could easily be performed by AI and which tasks would require a different approach.
A multidisciplinary team of researchers authored the paper, including Karim Lakhani and Edward McFowland III from Harvard Business School; Ethan Mollick, SM ’04, PhD ’10, from The Wharton School; Hila Lifshitz-Assaf from Warwick Business School; and MIT Sloan’s Kate Kellogg.
Here’s a closer look at the study, along with some suggestions from Dell’Acqua, Kellogg, and Lifshitz-Assaf of steps organizations can take when introducing generative AI to a highly skilled workforce.
For best results, use cognitive effort and experts’ judgment
The study was conducted in collaboration with Boston Consulting Group and involved more than 700 consultants who were assigned a skills assessment task and an experimental task.
The participants were sorted into two groups: One group was given a task designed to fall within GPT-4’s capabilities of producing humanlike outputs, while the other group received a task “designed so that GPT-4 would make an error when conducting the analysis, ensuring the work fell just outside the frontier,” according to the paper.
Within those two groups, study participants were sorted into three conditions: no access to AI, access to GPT-4 AI, and access to GPT-4 AI with an overview of how to use GPT.

Generative AI can improve a highly skilled worker’s performance by as much as 40% compared with workers who don’t use it.
The “inside the frontier” group was asked to imagine that they worked for a shoe company and that their manager had asked them to come up with a new product and present it at a meeting. Participants in this group were also instructed to complete several other actions, including coming up with a list of steps from pitch to launch, creating a marketing slogan, and writing a 2,500-word article describing the end-to-end process for developing the shoe and lessons learned.
AI had a positive effect on that group of participants: The GPT-only participants saw a 38% increase in performance compared with the control condition (no access to AI), while the performance of those who were provided with both GPT and an overview saw a 42.5% increase in performance compared with the control condition.
Interestingly, the researchers observed a bigger jump in performance scores for the participants in the lower half of assessed skills who used GPT-4 compared with those in the top half of assessed skills — at 43% and 17%, respectively — when they were compared with their baseline scores (i.e., no AI use).
The “outside the frontier” group was asked to imagine that they worked for a company with three brands. They were tasked with writing a 500-to-750-word memo to their CEO explaining which of the brands the CEO should invest in to drive revenue, and with suggesting innovative actions the CEO could take to improve the selected brand. The memo needed to include the rationale for their recommendation, and group participants were provided with interview comments and financial data from which they could draw. Additionally, participants were graded on the “correctness” of their recommendation — their reasoning or justification — by human evaluators.
AI had a negative effect on participants in this group. The GPT-only condition saw a decrease in performance of 13 percentage points compared with the control condition, while participants who had been provided with GPT and an overview showed a decrease of 24 percentage points compared with the control condition.
Dell’Acqua said that for the “outside the frontier” group, the researchers observed a performance decrease because people would “kind of switch off their brains and follow what AI recommends,” which was more likely to be incorrect. However, even when an incorrect recommendation was made under one of the AI conditions, the quality of the participant’s recommendation justification improved.
The quality improvement and decrease in performance indicates that, rather than blindly adopting AI outputs, highly skilled workers need to continue to validate AI and exert “cognitive effort and experts’ judgement when working with AI,” the researchers write.

Interface design, onboarding, role reconfiguration, and a culture of accountability
According to the researchers, there are several things organizations and managers should consider as they integrate AI into their employee workflows.
While it’s tempting to use AI for knowledge work because it is fast, can boost rapid idea generation, and produces persuasive text, managers and professionals need to be cautious when using it for important tasks, Lifshitz-Assaf said.
Because some AI-generated answers look credible even when they’re incorrect, “that suggests there’s a role for internal or ‘wrapper’ developers to help design the interface in a way that makes it less likely that people fall into some of these traps,” Kellogg said.
Developers can also help with figuring out where AI can be inserted into workflows and how to design technology for doing that.
Kellogg and Dell’Acqua also recommended that organizations have an onboarding phase so workers can get a sense of how and where the AI works well and where it doesn’t and receive performance feedback. Relatedly, some people are very good at upskilling themselves, and those workers can be helpful as peer trainers. But they should be rewarded and recognized for their work.
Managers will also need to reconfigure roles.
“To use generative AI well, it’s important to investigate the specific tasks along the work process,” Lifshitz-Assaf said. “Some may be within the jagged frontier, and others outside.”
Kellogg said that leaders can encourage role reconfiguration by having people from different positions experiment together to find the most productive structure.
Leaders should also encourage a culture of accountability. In talking with study participants, Kellogg said, one suggestion was that “we need to teach people to be able to explain what they did without using the term ‘generative AI.’”
“Managers and workers need to collectively develop new expectations and work practices to ensure that any work done in collaboration with generative AI meets the values, goals, and standards of their key stakeholders,” Kellogg said.

A new survey I worked on, sponsored by AWS and the MIT Chief Data Officer Symposium, has been released, and it’s one of the first I have seen that addresses how organizations are dealing with generative AI. There are some interesting findings, the most important of which is that while those who are leading data and AI efforts at their companies think that generative AI is likely to transform their organizations, they haven’t done much yet to prepare for the change.


Let’s get into the details. First, there is some diffusion of responsibility relative to generative AI. The survey was of 334 global chief data officers (CDOs), who usually lead the development of analytics and AI as well. But in this survey, only 42% of CDOs said they have responsibility for strategy and execution with respect to generative AI. This is despite 49% saying that they are responsible for building AI capabilities, and 61% for advanced analytics capabilities. It’s not clear who else has the oversight for generative AI, but AI is highly related to analytics and highly dependent on data, so I hope it moves into the CDO bailiwick eventually.

Overall, the surveyed CDOs are excited about the potential of generative AI. 80% believe it is likely to transform their organizations. 45% agreed that they foresee or are already seeing wide adoption of it within their organizations. That should motivate a lot of activity to get ready for it.

PROMOTED
Experimentation, Not Production
Despite this enthusiasm, it is clearly early days for AI in most organizations. 16% of CDOs said their organizations ban it altogether, which to my mind is a bad idea—it’s easy enough to protect intellectual property if that’s your concern. 47% said their organizations were allowing experimentation at the individual employee level, either with or without clear usage guidelines. Only 19% said they had department or business unit-level experimentation with gen AI use cases, and 11% had organization-wide experiments. A mere 6% said they had one or more gen AI use cases in production deployment. We clearly need more of those.

In terms of what organizations are experimenting with, 40% said their focus was on overall personal productivity. That’s fine, but the technology clearly offers more. One potential benefit it offers is customer operations benefits, such as with gen AI chatbots. 44% are prioritizing this type of use case—the highest percentage. 37% are prioritizing use cases for software engineering, such as code generation. 32% are pursuing marketing and sales use cases, and 14% are prioritizing R&D applications.

Data Is Key, But It’s Not Ready
CDOs believe data is key to preparing for generative AI, but they haven’t done much yet with it. 93% agree that “data strategy is crucial to getting business value from generative AI.” However, 57% said that they had made no changes to data yet to prepare for generative AI. Only 38% agreed that “My team and I have the right data foundation to pivot to generative AI,” and only 11% agreed strongly with the statement. 71% agreed that “generative AI is interesting, but we are more focused on other data initiatives to achieve more tangible value.” Tangible value is great, but perhaps this low priority is why many CDOs haven’t been given responsibility for generative AI. At least they are planning to spend more on the technology: 62% said that their teams are planning on investing more in generative AI.

Those who are preparing seem to be taking relatively small steps. 25% are undertaking “data integration or cleaning of datasets for generative AI use cases;” 18% are surveying data that might support gen AI use cases, and 17% are curating proprietary documents or textual data to train domain-specific generative AI.

Upping Their Game
I believe that CDOs need to increase their focus on generative AI. It is the technology that has most excited both executives and employees in organizations around the world. CDOs can use this to build their own reputations; one that we interviewed for the survey report, for example, said that she feels like the “belle of the ball” since generative AI came out.
If organizations are to succeed with generative AI, they need to increase the focus on data preparation for it, which is a primary prerequisite for success. Leaders in the adoption of generative AI, such as Morgan Stanley, have been working aggressively on these types of initiatives for a couple of years.
They also need to become experts on the technology and how to take advantage of it. Among other things, this means using gen AI in their own work. In our survey, only 53% said that they were currently using generative AI themselves. Admittedly, it’s almost a full-time job to keep track of all the changes in this technology, but you can’t become an expert just by reading about it.
Generative AI is the most dramatic advancement of our age. It’s time that companies were more active in their preparation for and adoption of it. Chief data officers can lead the way, but it’s not clear that they are doing so yet. Granted that these busy executives already have a lot on their plates (see survey report for details), but this is already or soon to be the main course.

Artificial intelligence that actually sounds… intelligent? Yes, it’s possible, with GPT-3. GPT-3, or third generation Generative Pre-trained Transformer, is a neural network machine learning model developed by OpenAI that can generate any kind of human-language text. Only needing as little as a few sentences, GPT-3 can take a small input and create a large output of text -- often used for creating marketing copy and other business uses.

Generative AI technology, as the name implies, generates outputs based on some kind of input -- often a prompt supplied by a person. Some GenAI tools work in one medium, such as turning text inputs into text outputs, for example. Others transform among media: turning a text prompt into graphical output, perhaps, or a sound prompt into a textual output.







The most headline-grabbing uses of generative AI tools involve text generation. With the public release of ChatGPT in late November 2022, the world at large was introduced to an AI app capable of creating text that sounded more authentic and less artificial than any previous generation of computer-crafted text. Humans eagerly adopted it, making ChatGPT the fastest-growing app in history while using it for seemingly endless text-generating purposes, from writing term papers and taking a state bar exam to writing the scripts of the news stories about ChatGPT's capabilities.

GenAI's transformative role in various types of content
Text is not the only area where generative AI is pushing boundaries. Here are some examples of its broad impact.
Text-to-speech. Whether its own words or someone else's, generative AI is advancing speech synthesis, improving the quality of artificial readers for e-books, synthetic presenters for news clips and advertising -- including clickbait posts on social media -- synthetic characters in video games and literal chatbots that answer phone calls. Intonation, cadence and volume variations are all becoming more realistic, subtle and flexible. The improvement in quality is also increasing the threat of deepfake audio.
Image synthesis. OpenAI's Dall-E 2 and other products (see ""GenAI tools"" section below) use AI to create pictures based on text descriptions. If you tell one to create a ridiculous picture of 14 lemmings and a talking cantaloupe wearing a trenchcoat and pretending to be a private investigator, it will do so. Dall-E and its many competitors have taken a huge leap forward, in both their image quality and their ability to translate arbitrary text into images. Such systems are finding their way into advertising, product design, set design, film and other industries. But they are also showing potential as engines of misinformation and disinformation, as they can generate deepfake images of events that never happened or alter images of events that did happen.

Space synthesis. As is the case with images, this kind of synthesis can occur with 3D spaces and objects, both real and digital. On the real-world side, applications such as Autodesk or Spacemaker can help design buildings and the spaces in them or urban landscapes incorporating built and natural elements. In these situations, AI supplements human designers' work by filling in missing details or proposing solutions to fit specific code requirements or space and material constraints. Many companies -- most notably Meta and all the major game creators -- are also developing applications to generate virtual spaces for game designs. These AI systems can constantly generate new spaces and possibly even make them infinitely expandable.





Real-world examples of GenAI
The use of GenAI is continuing to emerge and expand within organizations. According to a recent Gartner poll of over 1,400 executive leaders, 43% indicated that they are in the process of piloting generative AI products and tools.
The instances that drive the use of GenAI in this setting can vary widely. The Gartner survey indicated that 47% of respondents invested in GenAI for customer-facing functions, such as sales, marketing and customer service. IT functions were also a common area where generative AI investments take place, which includes software development, infrastructure and operations.


Industries experimenting with generative AI tools
Pharmaceuticals. Pharmaceutical companies -- including Amgen, Insilico Medicine and others -- and academic researchers are working with generative AI in areas such as designing proteins for medicines. Predicting the folding of proteins has been an enormous challenge for geneticists and pharmaceutical developers for decades. Deep learning models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), are increasing researchers' abilities to understand and use protein synthesis.
Genetics research. Although its emergence in genetics research is not particularly rapid, generative AI is contributing to this field. A common barrier associated with the use of this technology for genetics research is limited access to genetic databases, largely due to privacy concerns. A recent study, however, consisted of training GANs and restricted Boltzmann machines to learn distributions of real genomic datasets. This would then enable them to create artificial genomes.
Manufacturing. In manufacturing, Autodesk, Creo and other products use generative AI to design physical objects. In some cases, they also create those objects through 3D printing or computer-controlled machining and additive manufacturing. Generative AI can create machine parts and subassemblies of larger objects, for example, and can sometimes optimize designs for the following aspects of the manufacturing process: materials efficiency (minimizing waste), simplicity (fewest parts) and speed of production.
Entertainment. ChatGPT, Dall-E and other tools are already employed in generating conceptual art to guide scenario and environment development and are expected to be used to generate full environments in the future. Generative AI tools are also taking up background music generation for games. It's worth noting that artists and corporations are filing a flurry of lawsuits based on copyright infringement and intellectual property theft, arguing that the use of their protected IP in the training data, coupled with the ability to request output in a particular person's style, equate to unfair use and violations of copyright. This kind of legal challenge is slowing the use of generative tools in some contexts.


Cautionary note on applying generative AI
It's important to underscore the downside of generative AI tools. As good as the text outputs are, for example, they still won't always meet the professional standards in the field in question. Professors often can tell immediately that the paper was not written by the student, just as they generally could when students bought papers from term-paper mills -- and instructors themselves can now deploy AI tools to detect papers that are produced by AI. Judges and other lawyers can pick apart briefs cobbled together by generalist AI because they are incorrectly reasoned or inadequately supported.
And so, the tragic flaw (in the Greek tragedy sense) of generative AI systems has come clearly into view: The characteristics that make the current GenAI tools so very powerful in creating real-sounding text and other content also make it possible for them to fabulate. That is, they can generate answers that are at odds with reality. To wit: the social media images of Pope Francis in a big, puffy white coat; Elon Musk hobnobbing with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez; and Donald Trump being dragged away by police.
Compounding the problem is the ability of the tools to make up supporting materials when pushed to provide support for something they generated. Pushed to support a point in a term paper, for example, a GenAI tool might fabricate a quote in support, for a real person or a person made up for the purpose. When asked to provide legal citations in support of a brief, an AI tool might make up court cases and even entire courts.
While the potential uses for GenAI tools are basically any use case in which a human would generate output in any medium, the tools are not yet ready to do everything well enough -- or cheaply enough -- to be used everywhere. Organizations seeking to implement GenAI tools have to be selective and proceed with significant provisions in mind.








Examples of generative AI tools
With all that in mind, GenAI tools are still hugely useful aids to professionals working with text. ChatGPT is the gold standard for general-purpose text synthesis, though similar tools such as Bloom can do about as well.
In addition to the problems cited above, in this context it's very important to keep in mind that a GenAI tool is perfectly capable of spitting out a block of text that is, in whole or in part, one of its training texts. In some cases, that text will have copyright attached to it, but the GenAI tool will not ""know"" that -- or, if it knows, will not tell you about it. So, using text that a GenAI tool spits out in any public-facing use case, such as an article for publication or ad copy, without considering this possibility and doing some due diligence is dangerous. And, of course, right now the output of such tools is not itself copyrightable, so publishing it is in effect giving it away as public-domain text.
Creating summaries
Some tools have been trained specifically for summarizing text, sometimes in specific fields. Writing assistance site Grammarly has a general-purpose summarizer, as do Jasper, QuillBot and TLDR This. Tools such as Iris.ai and SciSummary focus on academic papers, LegalMind and Legalyze on legal documents, and other specific publication spaces are seeing similar tools evolve to address them.
Creating translations
Translation is a special case of text-to-text transformation, and Google Translate is perhaps the best known and most widely used tool in the space. People also use Alexa Translations, Bing Translator and Meta's SeamlessM4T, as well as other general-purpose tools like ChatGPT. In areas of specific technical specialization, such as medicine or law, professional translators sometimes employ AI tools to assist them; currently, however, there are few AI tools themselves specialized by discipline.
Creating code
GenAI tools are extremely well suited to dealing with what are called domain-specific languages, which include networking protocols and programming languages. DSLs have strict and small vocabularies, along with well-defined and orderly syntaxes. General-purpose tools like ChatGPT can help; there are many specialized tools too, such as GitHub Copilot, Tabnine, CodeWP and Amazon CodeWhisperer, some of which can plug directly into a coder's chosen integrated development environment.
Creating documentation
Just as they can be used to generate code, AI tools can be used to document code. They can provide explanations of what a procedure does, for example, or what kinds of data an object holds and manipulates. They can sometimes even supply the explanation of what a procedure or module is used for in the framework of a larger program. While these tools might not always provide the level of explanation of an algorithm a human can, they can do an enormous amount of the tedious work of fully documenting a codebase.
Using GenAI to create images
GenAI got a huge and surprisingly positive PR bounce with the advent of ChatGPT. This distracted from -- and even, to some extent, washed away -- the previous round of much more negative commentary centered on AI image creation. Basically, discussion of image GenAI had focused largely on the destructive potential of deepfake images: fictional constructions intended to look like real photos of actual events and people.
The rise of Dall-E and Stable Diffusion around the time of GPT-3.5's release also helped broaden the discussion. Stories and examples focused on whimsy: ""Draw me a picture of a yellow dragon on a green motorcycle driving through Brown's Valley, Minnesota."" All the negative potentials associated with deepfakes persist, though, and other problems have become apparent as well.
Copyright considerations apply here, too, just as they do with text: Outputs might include protected inputs, and outputs cannot be copyrighted.
Creating pictures
Stable Diffusion, Midjourney and Dall-E -- now Dall-E 2 -- continue to be important. As indications of the breadth of the space, consider also the free photo restoration tool GFPGAN and Lumen5, a commercial product with a free ""community"" tier, which generates video content rather than still images. Hunting through the spaces at Hugging Face, a community built around free AI models such as Llama and Stable Diffusion, one can find specialized tools for other kinds of image generation or manipulation -- e.g., for comic creation or image upscaling.
Creating technical drawings
Generative design applies GenAI to the problems of computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) by generating design models and images. Generative design has been applied in areas as diverse as architecture and urban planning, civil engineering, mechanical engineering and biomedical device design. Autodesk Fusion 360 and Dassault CATIA Generative Design Engineering, longtime CAD/CAM vendors, are prominent generative design tools.
Creating logos and icons
Any image generator can generate a logo, but there are specialist AIs focused on this activity specifically, including Logo Diffusion, Designs.ai Logomaker and Looka Logo Maker.


Future generative AI examples
Although there's no way to predict which generative AI examples and use cases show the most promise for the future, there are some -- such as image generation and speech synthesis -- that have shown enormous progress in the last few years. Other areas, such as medicine and manufacturing, have also proven enormously promising and show the wide range of fields that AI might contribute to. Progress in physical use cases appears slower, which makes sense given the inherent limits imposed by manipulating matter instead of data.
Such progress builds on itself, a dynamic on full display in 2022 and 2023. As the base tools become cheaper, more widely available and easier to use, the pool of people harnessing those tools broadens. This increases the number and type of situations those tools get trained to deal with, further accelerating the pace of change.
Incorporating generative AI into other AI-powered tool suites can turn them into a more powerful gestalt. For example, current code- and documentation-generation systems aren't great, but as they improve and are combined with other kinds of AI systems already in place -- for detecting coding errors, common security flaws and the use of licensed code in unlicensed ways, for example -- the developer tool set will become more powerful and productive.
What's important to remember is that there are antisocial and dangerous applications of AI that will also become easier in the same ways.

These machine learning models are only capable of pumping out images and text because they’ve been trained on mountains of real people’s creative work, much of it copyrighted. Major AI developers including OpenAI, Meta and Stability AI now face multiple lawsuits on this. Such legal claims are supported by independent analyses; in August, for instance, the Atlantic reported finding that Meta trained its large language model (LLM) in part on a data set called Books3, which contained more than 170,000 pirated and copyrighted books.And training data sets for these models include more than books. In the rush to build and train ever-larger AI models, developers have swept up much of the searchable Internet. This not only has the potential to violate copyrights but also threatens the privacy of the billions of people who share information online. It also means that supposedly neutral models could be trained on biased data. A lack of corporate transparency makes it difficult to figure out exactly where companies are getting their training data—but Scientific American spoke with some AI experts who have a general idea.Where do AI training data come from?To build large generative AI models, developers turn to the public-facing Internet. But “there’s no one place where you can go download the Internet,” says Emily M. Bender, a linguist who studies computational linguistics and language technology at the University of Washington. Instead developers amass their training sets through automated tools that catalog and extract data from the Internet. Web “crawlers” travel from link to link indexing the location of information in a database, while Web “scrapers” download and extract that same information.A very well-resourced company, such as Google’s owner, Alphabet, which already builds Web crawlers to power its search engine, can opt to employ its own tools for the task, says machine learning researcher Jesse Dodge of the nonprofit Allen Institute for AI. Other companies, however, turn to existing resources such as Common Crawl, which helped feed OpenAI’s GPT-3, or databases such as the Large-Scale Artificial Intelligence Open Network (LAION), which contains links to images and their accompanying captions. Neither Common Crawl nor LAION responded to requests for comment. Companies that want to use LAION as an AI resource (it was part of the training set for image generator Stable Diffusion, Dodge says) can follow these links but must download the content themselves.Web crawlers and scrapers can easily access data from just about anywhere that’s not behind a login page. Social media profiles set to private aren’t included. But data that are viewable in a search engine or without logging into a site, such as a public LinkedIn profile, might still be vacuumed up, Dodge says. Then, he adds, “there’s the kinds of things that absolutely end up in these Web scrapes”—including blogs, personal webpages and company sites. This includes anything on popular photograph-sharing site Flickr, online marketplaces, voter registration databases, government webpages, Wikipedia, Reddit, research repositories, news outlets and academic institutions. Plus, there are pirated content compilations and Web archives, which often contain data that have since been removed from their original location on the Web. And scraped databases do not go away. “If there was text scraped from a public website in 2018, that’s forever going to be available, whether [the site or post has] been taken down or not,” Dodge notes.Some data crawlers and scrapers are even able to get past paywalls (including Scientific American’s) by disguising themselves behind paid accounts, says Ben Zhao, a computer scientist at the University of Chicago. “You’d be surprised at how far these crawlers and model trainers are willing to go for more data,” Zhao says. Paywalled news sites were among the top data sources included in Google’s C4 database (used to train Google’s LLM T5 and Meta’s LLaMA), according to a joint analysis by the Washington Post and the Allen Institute.Curated by Our EditorsThe State of Large Language ModelsSophie Bushwick & Lauren Leffer'AI Anxiety' Is on the Rise--Here's How to Manage ItLauren LefferAI Platforms like ChatGPT Are Easy to Use but Also Potentially DangerousGary MarcusParis Olympics Will Be a Training Ground for AI-Powered Mass SurveillanceAnne Toomey McKenna & The Conversation USWeb scrapers can also hoover up surprising kinds of personal information of unclear origins. Zhao points to one particularly striking example where an artist discovered that a private diagnostic medical image of herself was included in the LAION database. Reporting from Ars Technica confirmed the artist’s account and that the same data set contained medical record photographs of thousands of other people as well. It’s impossible to know exactly how these images ended up being included in LAION, but Zhao points out that data get misplaced, privacy settings are often lax, and leaks and breaches are common. Information not intended for the public Internet ends up there all the time.In addition to data from these Web scrapes, AI companies might purposefully incorporate other sources—including their own internal data—into their model training. OpenAI fine-tunes its models based on user interactions with its chatbots. Meta has said its latest AI was partially trained on public Facebook and Instagram posts. According to Elon Musk, the social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) plans to do the same with its own users’ content. Amazon, too, says it will use voice data from customers’ Alexa conversations to train its new LLM.But beyond these acknowledgements, companies have become increasingly cagey about revealing details on their data sets in recent months. Though Meta offered a general data breakdown in its technical paper on the first version of LLaMA, the release of LLaMA 2 a few months later included far less information. Google, too, didn’t specify its data sources in its recently released PaLM2 AI model, beyond saying that much more data were used to train PaLM2 than to train the original version of PaLM. OpenAI wrote that it would not disclose any details on its training data set or method for GPT-4, citing competition as a chief concern.Why are dodgy training data a problem?AI models can regurgitate the same material that was used to train them—including sensitive personal data and copyrighted work. Many widely used generative AI models have blocks meant to prevent them from sharing identifying information about individuals, but researchers have repeatedly demonstrated ways to get aroundthese restrictions. For creative workers, even when AI outputs don’t exactly qualify as plagiarism, Zhao says they can eat into paid opportunities by, for example, aping a specific artist’s unique visual techniques. But without transparency about data sources, it’s difficult to blame such outputs on the AI’s training; after all, it could be coincidentally “hallucinating” the problematic material.A lack of transparency about training data also raises serious issues related to data bias, says Meredith Broussard, a data journalist who researches artificial intelligence at New York University. “We all know there is wonderful stuff on the Internet, and there is extremely toxic material on the Internet,” she says. Data sets such as Common Crawl, for instance, include white supremacist websites and hate speech. Even less extreme sources of data contain content that promotes stereotypes. Plus, there’s a lot of pornography online. As a result, Broussard points out, AI image generators tend to produce sexualized images of women. “It’s bias in, bias out,” she says.Bender echoes this concern and points out that the bias goes even deeper—down to who can post content to the Internet in the first place. “That is going to skew wealthy, skew Western, skew towards certain age groups, and so on,” she says. Online harassment compounds the problem by forcing marginalized groups out of some online spaces, Bender adds. This means data scraped from the Internet fail to represent the full diversity of the real world. It’s hard to understand the value and appropriate application of a technology so steeped in skewed information, Bender says, especially if companies aren’t forthright about potential sources of bias.Sign Up for Our Daily NewsletterEmail AddressBy giving us your email, you are agreeing to receive the Today In Science newsletter and to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.Sign UpThank you for signing up! Check out our other newslettersHow can you protect your data from AI?Unfortunately, there are currently very few options for meaningfully keeping data out of the maws of AI models. Zhao and his colleagues have developed a tool called Glaze, which can be used to make images effectively unreadable to AI models. But the researchers have only been able to test its efficacy with a subset of AI image generators, and its uses are limited. For one thing, it can only protect images that haven’t previously been posted online. Anything else may have already been vacuumed up into Web scrapes and training data sets. As for text, no such similar tool exists.Website owners can insert digital flags telling Web crawlers and scrapers to not collect site data, Zhao says. It’s up to the scraper developer, however, to opt to abide by these notices.In California and a handful of other states, recently passed digital privacy laws give consumers the right to request that companies delete their data. In the European Union, too, people have the right to data deletion. So far, however, AI companies have pushed back on such requests by claiming the provenance of the data can’t be proven—or by ignoring the requests altogether—says Jennifer King, a privacy and data researcher at Stanford University.Even if companies respect such requests and remove your information from a training set, there’s no clear strategy for getting an AI model to unlearn what it has previously absorbed, Zhao says. To truly pull all the copyrighted or potentially sensitive information out of these AI models, one would have to effectively retrain the AI from scratch, which can cost up to tens of millions of dollars, Dodge says.Currently there are no significant AI policies or legal rulings that would require tech companies to take such actions—and that means they have no incentive to go back to the drawing board.Rights & PermissionsLauren Leffer is a contributing writer and former tech reporting fellow at Scientific American.

Stack Overflow, a question-and-answer portal for developers, is laying off nearly a third of its workforce to replace it with generative AI-driven coding assistants, such as Microsoft Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer, and Google Bard.
“This year we took many steps to spend less. Changes have been pursued through the lens of minimizing the impact on the lives of Stackers. Unfortunately, those changes were not enough and we have made the extremely difficult decision to reduce the company’s headcount by approximately 28%,” company CEO Prashanth Chandrasekar wrote in a blog post.
The downsizing activity, which impacted the go-to-market and support teams, was a result of the company’s strategy to focus on its products and move toward profitability, especially at a time when macroeconomic conditions are uncertain, Chandrasekar said.











 
 
 
Stack Overflow has also restructured the remaining workforce in order to boost its Overflow AI offering, which uses generative AI to answer developer questions.

While Chandrasekar blamed macroeconomic conditions for the layoffs, the downsizing can be directly linked to the proliferation of generative AI assistants, a study from Cornell University showed.
The study, which investigated how the release of ChatGPT changed human-generated open data on the web by analyzing the activity on Stack Overflow, found that ChatGPT is displacing duplicate or low-quality content.











 
 
 
“These results suggest that more users are adopting large language models to answer questions and they are better substitutes for Stack Overflow for languages for which they have more training data,” the authors of the study wrote.
While the authors called out the improved efficiency of the generative AI-driven coding assistants, they also pointed out that widespread adoption of such tools may result in a shift away from public exchange on the web, which will limit the open data that developers and models can learn from in the future.
This is the second round of layoffs at Stack Overflow so far this year as the company tries to meet its profitability goals. In May, the company laid off 58 staffers. The impacted employees included positions such as UX designers, human resource professionals, product designers, and senior software developers, LinkedIn posts from the affected employees showed.











 
 
 
Layoffs at several technology companies, including Amazon, Meta, Google, and Microsoft, have seen professionals across roles lose jobs since last year.
According to data compiled by Layoffs.fyi, the online tracker keeping tabs on job losses in the technology sector, 1061 technology companies have laid off about 243,141 staff so far this year, compared to 164,769 employees laid off last year.

Can we stop generative AI art? With ever increasing access to the best AI art generators and now AI image generation even becoming available directly in Bing and Google search, that seems unlikely. However, steps are being taken to fight back against generative AI.Artists have been shocked to find that their names were being used as prompts to churn out pastiche works that closely mimic their distinctive styles, sometimes even carrying garbled versions of their own signatures. Even when AI-generated images from don’t closely resemble any one artist’s work, many find it galling that their images have been used as training data without their consent to create a product that may threaten their livelihoods (see our pick of the best AI art tutorials and our guide to how to use DALL-E 2 for more on how text-to-image generators work).The outrage of artists work being scraped to train AI art generators such as Stable Diffusion and Midjourney caused many digital artists to protest on ArtStation. While we still look on in amusement at the freakiest AI art, this technology is becoming no joking matter for many digital artists. We spoke to several artists about the problems with AI art. None of the art in this article is AI generated.Generative AI art: the problemArtists like Deb JJ Lee are taking action against AI art generators to protect their work and copyrights (Image credit: Deb JJ Lee)Illustrator Deb JJ Lee describes the moment they first encountered AI art in their style. ""The experience of seeing someone toss my work into Stable Diffusion and make a model off it was nothing short of devastating,"" they say. ""An artist’s voice is a lifetime development that is an amalgam of their visual vocabulary, interpretations of influences, and even their beliefs. It’s everything. To have work come out from a mindless machine learning model that looks just like mine, but without the struggle of developing that voice, is a slap in the face.""LATEST VIDEOS FROM creativebloqCreative BloqJJ Lee isn’t the only one to go through this experience, and some rights holders are fighting back. Three artists have launched a class-action lawsuit against Stable Diffusion with a lawyer also litigating against GitHub CoPilot, an AI-powered programming tool trained on publicly available code from GitHub.The suit alleges that ""Stable Diffusion contains unauthorised copies of millions – and possibly billions – of copy righted images,"" and seeks to use existing copyright law to sue Midjourney, Stability AI and DeviantArt. Getty Images has also filed a suit against Stable Diffusion, and the Concept Art Association has raised over $200,000 to pay for a government lobbyist in the US, with the intention of updating laws to ensure artists’ interests are protected.Images by German illustrator Roena Rosenberger have been used by AI generators without permission (Image credit: Roena Rosenberger)For individual artists, taking a first step legally can be a constructive action, even just to combat frustration and help with mental wellbeing. Roena Rosenberger, an illustrator and concept artist based in Germany, used her legal costs insurance to hire a lawyer with a view to suing companies that have used her images to train AI models without her consent.Get the Creative Bloq NewsletterDaily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.""It absolutely gave me peace of mind,"" she says. ""I'm a person who needs to have a plan and it helped me a lot to contact a lawyer."" Strategically it makes sense for her to wait until the German courts are more familiar with the issue before moving forward, so she’s currently biding her time.Rosenberger describes the technology as ""a pretty, glossy toy"" that’s alarmingly good at mimicry of artists’ styles, and notes that similar tools will likely start to affect other professions. When that happens, many more people will join the fight to protect the rights of creators. ""Our boat won’t stay as small as it is now,"" she says.Generative AI art needs to be ethical""I'd like AI image generator founders to finally listen to artists. So far they haven't,"" says Christina Kraus. (Image credit: Christina Kraus)Many artists hope the makers of AI image generators will be forced to discard models trained on data sets that contain work they don’t have permission to use, and build new ones using images for which they do have consent. Some companies are going down this road already, for example the photo and video editor Prequel powers some of its effects with its own in-house neural network built on images that artists have been commissioned and paid to create.It's hoped that when artists’ rights are respected, the conversation can move on to exploring how this technology can be used to assist the creative process, as opposed to replacing it. ""I would like to see studios have a dialogue with their artists on how it's possible to implement AI in a way that lightens the workload on tasks that are repetitive, tedious, unwanted time sinks, so that artists have more time for the actual important creative work,"" says Christina Kraus, a freelance artist who specialises in fantasy characters.Alongside the ethical issue of artists’ work being used without permission is the question of the extent to which AI art poses a threat to the livelihoods of artists. It’s often pointed out that AI can’t do the kind of problem-solving that’s core to the role of a professional artist, so do they really need to worry?""I think they have the potential to become a serious threat to working artists in the future if they don't get regulated,"" says Kraus. ""We already see AI images being used on book and magazine covers, to illustrate articles, and even Netflix experimenting with using AI for its anime Dog and Boy.""""Companies simply don't want to pay artists a fair wage for their work and AI is a quick and cheap fix,"" says Kraus. (Image credit: Christina Kraus)Kraus anticipates that more companies will follow in the footsteps of Netflix, especially as the technology becomes more capable and overcomes some of its limitations. ""It's always about saving money and churning out as much content as possible, often with no regard for the quality of the output or the wellbeing of the people creating it,"" she says.""I don't think that AI can displace artists entirely, but it will change the climate, and many of the entry-level jobs that provide the first working experiences will be taken over by AI. Students and artists trying to break in will have an even harder time.""Kraus supports efforts to make training sets ethical by obtaining consent and paying artists, but still holds reservations about the basic nature of the technology. Could we end up with a situation similar to music streaming, in which artists are paid a pittance per ‘use’ of their work?""If AI becomes ethical, there’s nothing to stop companies from using it. If we’re lucky, we’ll get a few bucks for our images being in the training data and that's it. That's why it's so important that studios have a dialogue with artists instead of simply cutting costs and getting rid of them. In the end, I'm not sure if ethical AI would make the situation better or worse for artists at large.""The impact of AI art is seriousCopyright infringement of art has been taken less seriously than fields such as music or film, until now (Image credit: Greg Rutkowski)One artist who became a prominent voice in the conversation is Greg Rutkowski, after it became a trend to use his name as a prompt for generating a particular painterly style. ""I was shocked to find so many artworks signed with my name that weren't mine,"" he says.Rutkowski sees the use of artwork to train AI models without permission as a ""violation on many levels"", and believes that the building of datasets for AI should be strictly regulated. Like many artists, he notes that while AIs might be good at copying a style and producing work with superficial appeal, they can’t design art the way a human does and adapt to feedback.""There is a purpose in designing something from scratch,"" he says. ""When you design clothing for a specific time period, you think about its purpose and the historical context. When you create concept art of machinery, for example, it has to make sense, be believable and look like it works. So far, AIs produce abstract, almost surreal ideas, that may lead you somewhere but have no consistent purpose.""The current situation is something we have seen many times before and will no doubt see again: a new technology emerges and the law has to catch up. Only when that happens will we have an idea of how AI art will fit into our lives.This article originally appeared in Imagine FX issue 226. If you liked this piece, you'll love ImagineFX.

CopyWill Artificial Intelligence replace architects in their roles? In the May 2023 edition of Building magazine, Thomas Lane suggests that AI has the potential to automate up to 37% of the tasks typically carried out by architects and engineers. This automation, though, is likely to target routine and less creative tasks, allowing professionals to concentrate on more strategic and imaginative aspects of their work.Just as Revit and 3D software did not replace architects but only transformed their workflows, the same principle holds for AI tools. AI is poised to bring about new tasks, such as AI management, alongside existing responsibilities, signaling a shift in how architects work.In early 2023, the abundance of images generated by Midjourney and similar AI systems has left many architects pondering its implications. While there's a general concern about the possibility of Artificial Intelligence becoming all-powerful, architects are also intrigued and actively exploring how AI can be integrated into their practice, seeking to grasp its potential applications in their field.It is improbable that AI will fully replace architects shortly. The architectural landscape is evolving rapidly, and although new applications will continue to surface, we are gradually gaining a clearer comprehension of AI's capabilities and boundaries. This developing understanding is shaping a more defined perspective of how AI can impact and transform our professional endeavors.We have nothing to worry about until AI wins an architectural design competition.Possible Future UsesHere are some broad categories that illustrate how Artificial Intelligence can complement architects and enhance our work:1) Design Options Based on Specific CriteriaAI algorithms are highly skilled at handling vast amounts of data and, when equipped with the right tools, have the potential to generate design choices. In the future, architects will likely input criteria like budget, space needs, or sustainability objectives, enabling AI to produce optimized design alternatives for human review.

Imagem © Ulises Design Studio (@ulises.ai)2) Site Analysis and Mass StudiesAI tools, such as Autodesk Forma, can extract urban information from open-access databases and help you quickly create mass studies considering environmental data, floor areas, building shapes, heights, setbacks, building codes, etc.3) Generative Design:AI can rapidly produce visual designs when given specific guidelines, including photorealistic images. Architects can leverage generative design software like Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, Dall-e 2, or Adobe Firefly to investigate different material choices and spatial designs during the initial project phases. Furthermore, hand-drawn sketches or existing images can be used as a starting point for creating more elaborate designs, iterating on them, or making modifications.4) Pattern RecognitionAI can analyze and identify patterns within extensive datasets, spanning architectural drawings, technical configurations, and historical projects. Currently, the process of creating a database that's easily accessible and analyzable by AI is complex, but it is anticipated to become more manageable in the future as technology advances.5) Coding - Custom Apps, Programs, and PluginsAI can assist in coding and developing your applications and software, potentially aiding in organizing your design resources for building databases. It would be particularly beneficial if there were open-source code libraries where architects could collaborate and share information, as opposed to the current situation where libraries are often isolated and fragmented under corporate ownership.6) Energy Efficiency and SustainabilityAI can help architects design energy-efficient and sustainable buildings. By analyzing factors such as climate data, building orientation, material, and energy consumption patterns, AI algorithms can recommend design modifications that make building energy use more efficient and reduce its environmental impact.Save this picture!Contemporary house in Mexico according to IA. Image © Ulises Design Studio (@ulises.ai)7) Data SummarizationAI can additionally assist in condensing information from books and reports, making it easier for you to locate essential details swiftly while still having the source available for review. ChatGPT is currently introducing plugins, initially accessible to Premium subscribers, that broaden the range of data that can be analyzed, including real-time internet data.8) Building MaintenanceAI tools have been developed to analyze video feeds and detect weaknesses in areas such as road conditions and the exteriors of existing buildings, which enables early detection of required maintenance for infrastructure.9) Bim and Project ManagementBuilding Information Modeling (BIM) is a digital representation of a construction project, encompassing geometric data, materials, and other pertinent information. AI can analyze BIM data, spot potential conflicts or clashes, optimize schedules, and aid in project management activities, thus enhancing coordination and diminishing errors in the construction process.10) Virtual Reality and Augmented RealityArchitects can harness the power of AI-driven virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies to create visualizations and presentations of their designs. These immersive experiences enable stakeholders to navigate 3D virtual environments at various scales, even life-size (1:1 scale), to study spatial connections and make better-informed decisions regarding the building's design and layout.11) Cost Estimation and Material SelectionAI algorithms can scrutinize historical cost data, building material specifications, and market trends, offering precise cost estimates and material recommendations. Architects can utilize this data to make well-informed choices that align with budget restrictions and project needs. To employ this, you might need to establish a database and establish a method for AI to access it unless an open-source or subscription-based database for such information becomes accessible in the future.Save this picture!Contemporary house in China according to IA. Image © Ulises Design Studio (@ulises.ai)Considering TrainingWhile AI is unlikely to cause mass job losses for architects shortly, it will fundamentally change the nature of our profession. To effectively embrace new tools and evolving knowledge, architects must remain current and continually update their skill sets.The present moment calls for proactive discussions and solutions. Architects must begin leveraging AI to maintain a competitive edge in an ever more competitive environment. We must acquaint ourselves with AI's capabilities and elevate our proficiency to become ""superusers.""When examining architectural education, we find numerous disciplines that delve into the history of architecture but few that contemplate its future.

Many technologies created to strengthen social connections have had the opposite effect, making users feel isolated and misunderstood. And our move to remote work only extended this problem into the workplace. But generative AI can help bring people together again by helping them do what they do best: connect genuinely through shared experiences and storytelling, says John Ehrhard, CEO of Orson.
Social technologies were a saving grace for businesses when COVID-19 shuttered offices, and millions of people learned to work and remain connected to their teams from home. We gained something from the increased use of Zoom, Teams, Slack, and other collaboration tools. But we lost something, too. 
The ability to collaborate with individuals across different regions and time zones has undoubtedly presented incredible opportunities and efficiencies in business. But this connectivity brings serious pitfalls as well. Incorporating a remote workforce into a company’s culture poses its own set of obstacles.
Research showsOpens a new window  that teams who know and trust one another are more productive. But when people no longer gather together in a physical workplace daily and build face-to-face relationships, mutual understanding and trust become more difficult.
Alignment around a company’s vision can suffer, affecting both remote workers and their employers. With employees frequently switching companies, it becomes increasingly challenging to establish meaningful connections with colleagues. This prevailing sense of isolation and replaceability creates a breeding groundOpens a new window  for anxiety and depression.
Fortunately, the emergence of generative AI can help us reverse this trend. 
Antisocial Networks 
Social technologies designed for the workplace or to strengthen personal connections—have not entirely lived up to the promise of creating happy, cohesive communities. Instead, many have deepened divisions and contributed to increased rates of anxiety and depression. 
The sense of isolation can be particularly pronounced for younger users, which is why there is a growing movementOpens a new window  to prevent people from using Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, and other networks until they reach the age of 16. 
We have sacrificed understanding and empathy in our quest for brevity, reducing ourselves to mere soundbites. Though we have unparalleled access to information, we need more effective communication and genuine storytelling about who individuals truly are to determine who to trust. And the more reliant we become on technology, the more disconnected we feel. 
Many of the technologies we have been using to talk to work colleagues or loved ones don’t help to create and maintain new communities – they simply help us distribute content more easily. But real connections aren’t built on just a photo, video, or pithy comment. They are built on shared stories and empathy for one another. 
Social technologies, ironically, have caused our social skills to atrophy. But there is no reason we need to accept this outcome simply. We can fight it and use new technologies to strengthen communities and increase our social skills, especially one of our most critical: building community and empathy through storytelling.

The Art of Storytelling 
Throughout history, human beings have built connections through sharing our stories. But human storytelling arguably took a turn for the worse when stories filled with colorful characters, relatable scenes, and valuable lessons took the form of tweets and self-congratulating Instagram posts. 
Despite the many communication channels available, people today need help to tell their stories effectively. But deep human connection stems from meaningful interactions, and it is through storytelling that we feel stronger empathy toward one another and bind ourselves together into a community. 
Storytelling is ancient; even before oral storytelling took root, visuals were the preferred wayOpens a new window  to tell tales. Today, despite the emergence of many different channels and mediums, video is the most compelling way to share stories.
But telling stories this way has typically required the expertise of producers, directors, writers, cinematographers, and editors.
Reality TV earned a place in our hearts by making us fall in love with—or viscerally loathe, strangers within minutes. Behind this magic lies the science of storytelling.
But until the emergence of generative AI, creating video stories compelling enough to captivate people has been out of reach to just about everyone but entertainment industry insiders.
This is what has changed, and this is why technology can now begin to help us move closer together instead of further apart.

Generative Video
Tech companies today are integrating the science of storytelling into automated video storytelling technology, allowing anyone with an internet connection to create compelling stories and share them. 
AI can now function as a director, revolutionizing unscripted video storytelling by automating every aspect, from conducting interviews to crafting stories and editing engaging episodes with music, imagery, and graphics. 
Anyone can take a short film with a mobile phone. Still, generative AI allows us to take this concept further by building a fully dynamic experience customized to tell specific stories in specific ways. An AI video director can select music and visuals that synchronize with the narrative at precisely the right moments and ask the user the follow-up questions that help the story come to life. This results in beautifully crafted storytelling videos that build meaningful connections with audiences. 
An AI video director might sound like something to have fun with over the weekend, but it is far more than that. It can also be the ultimate employee engagement tool and workplace culture builder. 
Imagine being able to watch a micro-documentary of your new coworker to not only learn what they are passionate about but also to learn how they speak about things they are passionate about. Little things like that help teams get to know each other and build trust much more than reading a resume.
Building Genuine Team Connections in a Globalized World
A company’s success is directly linked to its ability to attract and retain talented individuals while nurturing a strong and connected company culture built around a shared purpose and mission. But today, scaling human connection has become even more daunting as workers try to collaborate across multiple time zones and company leaders look for new ways to lead teams.
Creating stories that resonate with employees across different levels, cultures, and backgrounds is nearly impossible if you don’t have decades of practice and understand the science of storytelling. A skilled AI director could help the CEO share their vision in a way that will resonate with their audience and build alignment and connection across the whole company.
Genuine team connection today necessitates a medium that transcends boundaries, something social media needs to catch up on. Only collaboration authentically and ideally in the visual format that people prefer can accomplish that.
Combining generative AI with video storytelling gives us the first real opportunity to do that. An AI director can do what previous digital collaboration tools and many HR teams have needed help to do.
Companies that want to experience the benefits of having a truly connected team should get on board.

Generative AI is a new and rapidly emerging form of artificial intelligence that has the potential to revolutionize precision medicine by improving diagnosis, treatment, and drug discovery. It’s comprised of Large Language Models and other intelligent systems that replicate a human’s ability to create text, images, music, video, computer code, and more.




So, naturally, when Damian Doherty, Editor-in-Chief of Inside Precision Medicine, approached me about writing an article on Generative AI, the first thing I did was ask the latest version of ChatGPT to provide a 2,800-word manuscript on the opportunities and issues of its application to precision medicine.
The content it generated was relevant, logically organized, and backed up with factual information. Sentence structures were precise and delivered in an easy-to-understand format. There was a formulaic beginning, middle, and end, with the correct provisos stated for being wrong.
The result was quite good, but in the end, it was a little too GPT-ish. There were many things my human brain wanted to know that it didn’t cover or guide me towards.
In some ways, this exercise mirrors the deeper discussions and explorations that are just getting underway to both understand our new and evolving AI capabilities and define a logical pathway to help clinicians and researchers make the practice of medicine more precise.
I’ve had the benefit of working with the application of AI in health and medicine for over a decade. Here are my very human thoughts on what should be considered as we approach this opportunity.
An AI taxonomy
Generative AI is a relatively new form of AI that has been released into the wild. As such, there are very few experts. This means that we are all early in the journey of understanding what it is and how we apply it to do good.
The chart below provides a simple taxonomy to help differentiate generative AI from other forms of Predictive Analytics.

While there is a great deal of hype over generative AI, there is a growing body of evidence on the things it can do well with humans in the loop:

Write clinical notes in standard formats such as SOAP (subjective, objective assessment and plan)
Assign medical codes such as CPT and ICD-10
Generate plausible and evidence-based hypotheses
Interpret complex laboratory results

Going forward generative AI will provide benefits in many areas including:
Drug Discovery and Development: Assistance in the discovery of new drugs and their development by predicting molecular structures, simulating drug interactions, and identifying potential drug candidates more quickly and accurately. AI can identify existing drugs that could be repurposed for new therapeutic uses, potentially speeding up the drug development process and reducing costs.
Personalized Treatment Plans: Analyze large-scale patient data, including genetic information, medical records, and imaging data, to guide physicians in the creation of personalized treatment plans tailored to an individual’s unique genetic makeup and health profile.
Disease Diagnosis: Assistance in the early and accurate diagnosis of diseases by analyzing medical images, genomic data, and clinical records, helping healthcare professionals make more informed decisions.
Medicine has been here before—change is hard
Since medicine came out of the shadows and into the light as a data-driven, scientific discipline we’ve always aspired to be better. The reality is that change is hard. It requires us to think and act differently.
When cholera was raging through London in the 1850’s Dr. John Snow was initially rebuffed when he challenged the medical establishment by gathering and presenting data demonstrating that the root cause of cholera was polluted water rather than the prevailing view that it was caused by bad air. From this came the early stages of epidemiology.
In the 1970’s the introduction of endoscopy into surgical practice was met with resistance in the surgical community which saw little use for “key-hole” surgery as the prevailing view and practice was that large problems required large incisions. Today, the laparoscopic revolution is seen as one of the biggest breakthroughs in contemporary medical history.
Generative AI and Large Language Models are part of medicine’s next frontier. They are already challenging current practices across the spectrum of research, clinical trials, medical and nursing school curricula, and the front-line practice of medicine. It’s not a matter of whether it will affect what you do but rather how and when.
With the right dialogue and guidance from a diverse set of stakeholders, we will create a path forward that leverages the benefits of our evolving creations to improve health and medical practices while ensuring that appropriate guardrails are put in place to monitor and guide its use.
It’s not about going slow. It’s about getting things right
In some ways, the challenge of generative AI today is less about increased AI capabilities and more about the velocity of change it is driving.
Generative AI came screaming into mainstream consciousness in the fall of 2022. ChatGPT, a generative AI product from OpenAI, racked up 100 million users in two months. In the history of humans, there has never been a product that has seen such rapid adoption. Shortly after ChatGPT reached this milestone the next version of GPT was released with greatly increased capabilities.

From the practice of medicine to the development of new drugs, generative AI’s “speed of progress” is not following the normal path that economists refer to as linear growth. This is where something new is created that adds incremental value, which then creates a small gap between the time of its creation and when it starts being used. As adoption occurs there is another small gap between uptake and the time it takes for policymakers to develop necessary guard rails to both guide its use and safeguard users from risks. Linear growth is steady and predictable and what clinical and operational systems are set up to manage.
Generative AI is upending linear growth. It’s taking a different trajectory that economists call exponential growth. This is where something increases faster as it gets bigger. Most of our systems are not designed to accommodate this dramatic escalation in change. Exponential growth doesn’t last and eventually, the pace of change returns to linear growth. But when it’s happening it feels like the world is inside a tornado.

Earlier this year, the European Parliament approved landmark rules for AI, known as the EU AI Act. While the regulation is far from becoming law, it aims to bring generative AI tools under greater restrictions. This includes generative AI developers being required to submit these systems for review before releasing them commercially.
The rapid change driven by generative AI has some calling for measures to slow or even suspend AI development to evaluate its impact on humans and society. A petition from the Future of Life Institute was put forward and signed by leaders including Elon Musk calling for a six-month moratorium on AI development.
While there is uncertainty in what we are creating and how it should be applied, it is unlikely that any mandates will slow the pace of AI innovation.
Instead of attempting to slow progress, let us expedite the education and dialogue among policymakers, medical and research leaders, and frontline practitioners to chart a course for progress in applying our new intelligent capabilities. These groups are also most relevant to ensuring that a necessary set of laws, regulations, and protocols are in place to safeguard those both providing and receiving health and medical services.
In keeping with this “gas and guardrails” approach to AI innovation there are two important areas to consider.
The creation of enforceable responsible AI principles
Let’s recognize and support the overall good that can come from AI innovation. At the same time, we must be mindful of how our ever-expanding AI capabilities can replicate and even amplify human biases and risks that work against the goal of improving the health and well-being of all citizens.
Prioritizing fairness and inclusion in AI systems is a socio-technical challenge. The speed of progress is spawning a new set of issues for governments and regulators. It’s also challenging us with new ethical considerations in the fields of medical and computer science. Ultimately the question is not only what AI can do, but rather, what AI should do.
While legislators and regulators work on finding common ground, health and medical organizations using AI today should have a defined set of Responsible AI principles in place to guide the development and use of intelligent solutions. Most often, these principles or guidelines are reviewed and approved at the highest level of leadership and incorporated into an organization’s overall approach to Data Governance.
A framework to manage decisions about decisions
Up until recently, all decisions in health and medicine were made by humans. As AI becomes pervasive in clinical processes it will increasingly make, aid, or impact thousands of granular decisions made each day.
Clinicians, researchers, and leaders must recognize how this impacts decision-making at all levels of an organization. Leaders will need to make a paradigm shift from “making decisions” to creating processes to guide making “decisions about decisions.”
One model gaining traction is put forward by Michael Ross, an executive fellow at London Business School, and James Taylor, author of Digital Decisioning: Using Decision Management to Deliver Business Impact from AI. The model creates a taxonomy well suited to the types of decisions made in providing health and medical services.  Categories include:
Human in the loop (HITL): A human is assisted by a machine. In this model, the human is making the decision, and the machine provides only decision support or partial automation of some decisions or parts of decisions. This is often referred to as intelligence amplification (IA).
Human in the loop for exceptions (HITLFE): Most decisions are automated in this model, and humans only handle exceptions. For the exceptions, the system requires some judgment or input from the human before it can make the decision, though it is unlikely to ask the human to make the whole decision. Humans also control the logic to determine which exceptions are flagged for review.
Human on the loop (HOTL): Here, the machine is assisted by a human. The machine makes the micro-decisions, but the human reviews the decision outcomes and can adjust rules and parameters for future decisions. In a more advanced setup, the machine also recommends parameters or rule changes approved by a human.
Human Out of the Loop (HOOTL): The machine is monitored by the human in this model. The machine makes every decision, and the human intervenes only by setting new constraints and objectives. Improvement is also an automated closed loop. Adjustments, based on feedback from humans, are automated.
Over time AI-driven leaders will create frameworks and new management models that optimize the use of AI in making decisions while supporting clinicians who will remain in control of improved clinical processes and workflows.
AI capabilities will continue to change. How it adds value won’t
In working with health and medical organizations I’m often surprised how many times I see significant investments being made in AI without leaders being able to explain how AI investments will actually drive value at scale.
Using AI to transform anything requires a fundamental understanding of the capability differences between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and what I call Natural Human Intelligence (NHI). Once understood, this becomes your superpower. You now have the ability to pair the unique characteristics of each to drive measurable change.
AI allows us to leverage massive quantities of data and information to look for patterns that humans simply don’t have the ability or time to see. AI is good at finding things we care about, such as identifying patients at high risk of readmissions, falls, or unexpected deterioration. Generative AI is increasingly showing it can generate plausible and evidence-based hypotheses, and automate many activities such as clinical notes or assigning diagnostic codes.
By contrast, humans have the unique ability to draw on a set of skills and characteristics that no form of AI can mimic or replicate. As “smart” as AI is becoming, no one has figured out how to imbue machines with qualities that are essential in the world of health and medicine like wisdom, reasoning, judgement, imagination, critical thinking, experience, abstract concepts and common sense. Such attributes remain as uniquely human characteristics that are essential to making decisions in the provision of health and medical services.
The key to AI driving value comes when it is planned and applied in ways that augment the experiences and skills of clinicians, researchers and knowledge works to help them be better at what they do.
AI in medicine is not about technology. It’s about empowerment
AI has a PR problem. The narrative in the popular press and professional journals is often negative. Headlines like “Half of U.S. Jobs Could be Eliminate With AI,” paint a picture of a future work world dominated by what novelist Arthur C. Clarke calls robo-sapiens.
It’s no wonder that people are worried. According to a study by the American Psychological Association, the potential impacts that AI could have on the workplace and jobs is now one of the top issues impacting the mental health of workers.
Generative AI is already impacting today’s workplace and will be the single greatest change affecting the future of work in the next decade. It will impact how all work is done. As you let that statement sink in, recognize that the issues to be addressed go beyond productivity. After all, work brings shape and meaning to our lives and is not just about a job or income.
In this regard, there is growing evidence to suggest that AI can increase not only productivity but also job satisfaction.
In a randomized trial using generative AI, 453 college-educated professionals were given a series of writing tasks to complete. Half were given support with ChatGPT. The control group was not given access to ChatGPT. The results showed that the time taken to complete tasks was reduced by 40% among those using this form of generative AI. Beyond increased productivity, those using ChatGPT reported an increase in job satisfaction and a greater sense of optimism. Most importantly, inequality between workers decreased.
Done right, AI is not about technology. It’s about empowerment. Properly curated, generative AI will help solve one of the most significant challenges facing healthcare – The shortage of human capital. Here are two immediate opportunities in medicine today.
Keyboard liberation
Many physicians spend more time doing administrative work than they do with patients. One-third of doctors spend 20 or more hours per week doing paperwork. The electronic health record (EHR) creates a virtual 24/7 work environment for physicians. The impact of such “desktop medicine” on their wellness is a challenge for clinicians and organizations alike.
The promise of AI reducing highly repetitive, low-value activities is what Eric Topol MD, Founder and Director of the Scripps Research Institute, and best-selling author of Deep Medicine, refers to as “keyboard liberation.” A study by McKinsey & Company suggests that using AI and intelligent solutions in healthcare could reduce lower-value, repetitive activities performed by clinicians by 36%.
Reducing cognitive burden
A newly minted physician in 1950 would go their entire career (fifty years) before medical knowledge doubled. Today it is doubling roughly every 72 days. Without the use of AI to tame the data explosion, growing cognitive burden impacts quality, patient safety and physician burnout.
Today, 50,000 data points are in the typical EHR system that physicians must sift through each day. Primary care physicians spend more than an hour each day processing notifications.
Value from the exponential growth of data will only be realized by humans harnessing the power of AI.
The effective introduction and use of generative AI in health and medicine enables both cost-cutting automation of routine work and value-adding augmentation of human capabilities. As it and other forms of AI become pervasive in health and medicine, a new intelligent health system will emerge. It will facilitate systems that improve health while delivering greater value. It will provide a more personalized experience for consumers and patients. It will liberate clinicians and restore them to be the caregivers they want to be rather than the data entry clerks we’re turning them into by forcing them to use systems and processes conceived decades ago.
And while generative AI is coming at us fast with much to understand in how we use it, it could not have come at a better time.

AI impact on tech workforce



Prominent figures in the technology industry have recently expressed their thoughts on how Artificial intelligence (AI) might significantly impact the workforce by cutting out numerous professions and leading society to reconsider how individuals spend their time. These forecasts were discussed during a conference where OpenAI CEO Sam Altman delved into AI’s possible influence in reshaping employment opportunities. As AI continues to advance and be integrated into various industries, there is a growing concern about the displacement of human labor, potentially resulting in job losses for many. However, some experts argue that AI and automation could create new jobs and industries, requiring workers to adapt and upskill to remain relevant in the changing job market.
There is a great vid on this discussion last Tuesday. Listen Here.
Unequal distribution of the effects of AI on society
Altman indicated that the unparalleled shifts prompted by AI would not impact everybody equally. However, he anticipates that society as a whole will see improvements, with specific demographics experiencing the majority of these transformations. The CEO of OpenAI highlighted that individuals most affected might have difficulty coming to terms with AI taking over their occupations and re-establishing their sense of purpose. As AI continues to become more prevalent, it will be crucial for governments, educational institutions, and organizations to provide the necessary resources and support to help those facing displacement in the workforce. By fostering adaptability, re-skilling, and promoting lifelong learning, societies can ensure a smoother transition and enable individuals to harness the potential of this technological revolution, turning challenges into opportunities for growth and innovation.
Experts anticipate that incorporating AI in various sectors will result in increased overall productivity and further technological advancements. Nevertheless, the approaching possibility of job loss due to AI has ignited conversations on potential solutions, such as retraining and workforce preparedness initiatives, to dampen the societal consequences of these technological advancements.
Collaboration between industry leaders and policymakers to discuss potential solutions to AI-driven job loss
Industry leaders must collaborate with policymakers to ensure a seamless transition and address the economic hurdles created by the AI-driven shift in the job market. Creating comprehensive strategies for reskilling and upskilling workers impacted by these changes will be essential in maintaining employment and fostering innovation. Furthermore, promoting continuous learning and adapting to new technology will help bridge the talent gaps, ensuring a more inclusive and prosperous future for all.

But new data indicates that AI will not be the job-killer many fear. Ninety-two percent of employees agree that in order to stay competitive their companies will have to shift to an AI-first approach in the next year, according to newly released research from IT solution provider Avanade. But rather than AI replacing jobs, 64% of business and IT leaders actually believe that AI will maintain or even increase the number of human roles at their organization in 2024, with most expecting headcount to increase by up to 9%.  ""This is not about job replacement, it's about task replacement,"" says Erik Barnett, North American digital healthcare and life sciences lead for Avanade. ""There's been so much conversation around the notion of replacing people's jobs when the data seems to prove and support that we still need people, just in different ways."" Read more: A 3 step guide on how AI can be HR leaders' best friend  Fifty-two percent of employees say they trust that their company has the proper safeguards in place to preserve jobs as they expand on AI. According to Barnett, roles that require a lot of coding, transcription and data entry will see the most AI-driven innovation in the months ahead, and the need for employees with the same skills and expertise that can fact check a chatbot's work will continue to grow. ""While AI will take some of the workload off of people's plates, there will be an audit and risk piece that will be increased as a result,"" Barnett says. ""There will be a need for all those technology pieces to come together and be transmitted in a certain way for review. Connecting all those dots behind the scenes is an area where we see potential job increase.""

   But presently, fewer than half of organizations have put in place a complete set of specific guidelines or policies for responsible use of AI, according to Avanade's research. Forty-nine percent of employees are not confident  that their organization's risk management processes are adequate for an enterprise-wide integration of generative AI. Additionally, most employees recognize that they will need additional education and training to best utilize these new tools. Read more: How AI is reshaping job security in the tech world""AI is like a whole new language,"" Barnett says. ""Employees will need to know how to ask themselves, 'How does this impact what we're doing today?' and 'How do we expect that to evolve over time?' There will be a continual change in elements, but that's a good thing as long as I have the right tools."" The task of addressing the skills gap will differ from company to company, according to Barnett. Most likely it will take a team effort among IT leaders, HR departments and even executive leadership.

With the explosive popularity of generative AI tools like ChatGPT, there have been rumors that Apple is working on its own AI product, and that some kind of ""Apple GPT"" artificial intelligence bot could launch in the future.





This guide highlights everything we know about Apple's experiments with AI, and it will be updated regularly as new rumors come out.

Internal Testing and Development

Apple's AI chief John Giannandrea is leading development on large language models within Apple, and Giannandrea reports directly to Apple CEO Tim Cook. Giannandrea established a team that works on conversational AI four years ago, and work has since ramped up.

For the last several months, Apple has been testing an ""Apple GPT"" rival that could compete with ChatGPT. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, work on AI is a priority for Apple, with the company designing an ""Ajax"" framework for large language models.

Apple has an internal chatbot that some engineers have been referring to as ""Apple GPT,"" but Apple would not, of course, ever use that naming for a consumer product. Apple employees need special permission to use the chatbot, and its output cannot be used to develop new product features for customers. It is used for product prototyping and it is able to answer questions about the data that was used to train it.

Ajax is said to be more capable than the prior-generation ChatGPT 3.5, and it has been trained on more than 200 billion parameters. As of September 2023, OpenAI's newer models are more powerful than Ajax. Apple reportedly does not have a ""clear strategy"" for how it will create a generative AI product for consumers. Apple is experimenting with Siri enhancements, software that generates videos and images, and multimodal AI technology that works with images, videos, and text.

Apple is said to be spending millions of dollars a day on conversational AI research as training language models requires a lot of hardware. Apple is on track to spend more than $4 billion on AI servers in 2024.

""Ask"" for AppleCare Support Advisors

Apple is testing a ChatGPT-style generative AI tool with its AppleCare support employees. Called ""Ask,"" the tool is designed to generate responses to technical questions and provide information from Apple's internal knowledge base to speed up support replies.

The feature is in beta right now. Advisors can rate a provided question as helpful or unhelpful, and can ask up to five follow-up questions per topic. Apple says the Ask tool is useful for solving complex issues, and because it is pulling from Apple's internal knowledge base, Apple has told advisors that the information is factual, traceable, and useful.

AI for Siri

Apple's work on generative AI could eventually be incorporated into its Siri voice assistant. Apple in February 2023 held an AI summit and briefed employees on its large language model work.

Because of the way Siri is built, it may take Apple quite a bit of time to update its database to support new capabilities. Former Siri engineer John Burkey told The New York Times that Siri's ""cumbersome design"" means that adding new phrases requires rebuilding the Siri database, which can take up to six weeks each time, while more complicated features like search tools can take upwards of a year.

There are also privacy concerns that Apple needs to contend with to bring generative AI capabilities to Siri. Apple has always been more cautious than its competitors, putting privacy ahead of functionality, a decision that has caused Siri to lag behind Alexa, Google Assistant, and other voice-based personal assistant options.

The Information suggests that Apple is aiming to create a feature that would let Siri automate multi-step tasks, automatically performing tasks that are accomplished with Shortcuts today.

According to Bloomberg, Apple is aiming for a smarter version of Siri that's deeply integrated with AI. Apple is planning to update the way that Siri interacts with the Messages app, allowing users to field complex questions and auto-complete sentences more effectively. 

Rumors suggest that Siri will have better natural conversation capabilities and improved user personalization. The new functionality will be available across device, so Siri may retain conversation information from one device to another.

AI for Apps

Apple is rumored to be planning to add AI to as many Apple apps as possible. In Apple Music, for example, Apple could use AI to create auto-generated playlists, while in Xcode, AI support could help developers write and troubleshoot code. 

In Pages and Keynote, AI could be used for writing and creating slide decks, while Apple's internal customer support apps could be updated with generative AI to assist with AppleCare. 

Apple's full generative AI vision will take time to fully scale, so the complete suite of AI features that Apple has planned might not arrive until 2025.

On-Device AI

The first AI features coming to the iPhone with iOS 18 will run entirely on-device using the iPhone's hardware rather than relying on a cloud server. Apple may add new capabilities in the future through a potential partnership, but on-device AI will be the focus to begin with.

News and Publisher Deals

Apple wants to partner with major publishers to get permission to use their content for AI training purposes.

So far, Apple has approached Condé Nast, NBC News, and IAC about possible AI deals. Condé Nast publications include Vogue, Wired, Vanity Fair, Ars Technica, Glamour, The New Yorker, GQ, and more, while IAC owns publications like People, The Spruce, Serious Eats, Martha Stewart Living, Real Simple, Entertainment Weekly, and Better Homes & Gardens.

Proposed deals have been worth at least $50 million, and would al... Click here to read rest of article

While some are worrying about AI wiping out their jobs, others are cashing on the hype — and big money — surrounding the technology by getting jobs in artificial intelligence.Since OpenAI launched ChatGPT last November, generative AI technology has taken the corporate world by storm. Venture capital firms have been pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into AI startups, and companies across industries are looking to beef up their own AI strategies in an effort to cash in on the hype.

That means more jobs in the generative AI space, with major companies like Amazon, Meta, and Netflix hiring employees to work on their AI initiatives and listing six-figure salaries.But it's not just tech companies seeking AI talent. Employers across a range of sectors — from law to education to healthcare — have been looking to hire workers familiar with tools like ChatGPT, and some were hiring prompt engineers to fine-tune their own AI chatbots.

So how do you start a career in AI and land a job?To understand what recruiters look for in applicants, Insider spoke to four hiring leaders at IBM, Nvidia, Hugging Face, and Jasper for their advice on how to land an AI-related job at their respective companies.Here are 4 tips from hiring leaders on how to increase your chances of landing a job in AI.1) Include your AI skills and past projects on your résuméBefore submitting your job application, make sure your résumé includes the skills and projects needed for the role.

When reviewing applications, Nvidia, the chip giant hiring for technical roles related to machine learning and AI, looks for ""critical skills"" related to math proficiency, programming, deep learning, algorithms, data handling, and AI infrastructure like utilizing graphic processing units, Lindsey Duran, the vice president of global recruiting at Nvidia, told Insider.IBM, the tech giant currently hiring AI engineers, AI application consultants, and AI research scientists, also requires applicants to have strong math and coding skills, as well as an understanding of APIs and other technical concepts, Chris Foltz, the chief talent officer at IBM, told Insider.

Demonstrating your technical expertise by showing examples of previous work is a plus, Flavien Coronini, the talent acquisition lead at Hugging Face, an AI company behind tools like text-to-image generator Stable Diffusion, told Insider.Since Hugging Face is an open source company, Coronini said he looks for GitHub links to their projects when reviewing resumes. By reviewing their projects, Coronini said he can gauge how much impact the applicant could bring to Hugging Face — whether that's the ability to solve a problem or make a program run faster — and can identify if their vision aligns with the company's mission.

When making hiring decisions for less-technical roles like sales and product management, the three recruiters said they look for ""soft skills"" like strong communication, the ability to collaborate, and adaptability to change.2) Demonstrate your interest in AI during the interview — and be able to prove itIf you're lucky enough to land an interview, be prepared to talk about your interest in generative AI.Alex Shapiro, the chief people officer at Jasper AI, an AI marketing and writing software that Shapiro said recently completed its ""key hiring"" over the last three years, said she expects job candidates to show that they've ""done their homework"" and ""understand the technology."" For instance, she said that candidates for engineering roles should be able to differentiate between a ""model layer"" and an ""app layer.""For technical and non-technical roles alike, interviewees can stand out if they can articulate how they've been playing around with generative AI tools like ChatGPT. This especially applies to those interviewing for client-facing roles like customer service as it shows ""whether or not people have dived into this industry,"" she said.

""For a new field, I think what helps us to differentiate people is just how much curiosity they've had about the space and what work they've done to learn more about it,"" Shapiro told Insider.Foltz, the chief talent officer at IBM, would agree with Shapiro. He said that applicants who read AI research papers, follow AI forums, and explore AI-related online courses stand out from the pool because it shows they are genuinely curious about AI and have a ""desire to continuously learn.""3) Don't expect your ChatGPT skills to get you hiredUsing AI tools like ChatGPT can be useful when writing your résumé and cover letters. But make sure you double-check the AI-generated documents for accuracy before submitting them.Shapiro acknowledged that using ChatGPT can be ""great"" in helping applicants ""brainstorm verbs"" and ""bring a level of polish"" to their applications. However, she urges applicants to make sure their AI-generated documents accurately reflect their qualities.

She said there's been times when Jasper recruiters interviewed candidates and discovered that there's a skill in their resume they didn't intend to be there, or a characterization they're not familiar with, which she said could lead to problems down the line.In fact, ChatGPT can actually hurt an applicant's chances of moving forward in the hiring process if the chatbot is used irresponsibly.Duran from Nvidia said there's been instances where recruiters at her company caught candidates using ChatGPT during interviews to answer questions, which she said is prohibited. Coronini from Hugging Face has even seen cover letters that include prompts like ""Insert a cover letter in order to explain why my background is a good fit for this role"" used to generate them — which he calls a"" ""really bad"" practice.""For me, this is a showstopper, because it doesn't really show your motivation to join,"" he said.

4) Don't be afraid to apply — even if you don't meet all of the job requirementsMany AI job listings may require applicants to have college or higher level degrees in computer science and engineering. But all the recruiters who spoke to Insider said they wouldn't rule out applicants who have less conventional backgrounds.Foltz said that IBM focuses on ""prioritizing skills and experiences"" over ""traditional degrees"" if they can demonstrate a ""foundational understanding of AI, whether that's knowing how to apply AI to their workflows, or taking ""industry-recognized"" online courses on AI and machine learning.Beyond education and AI experience, Duran said applicants from non-traditional backgrounds can shine if they can ""clearly communicate what makes them stand out"" by emphasizing their career milestones, leadership capabilities, and the impact of their previous projects.In some cases, Shapiro said workers with less conventional backgrounds may have more to offer than those with technical degrees. She said that Jasper hired employees who completed skills-based boot camps and believes that applicants who are career changers can be more equipped for particular roles than those with technical degrees — if they take the initiative to keep up with everything that's happening in generative AI.

""It's really valuable to have people come in from different perspectives,"" she said.

But all the recruiters who spoke to Insider said they wouldn't rule out applicants who have less conventional backgrounds.Foltz said that IBM focuses on ""prioritizing skills and experiences"" over ""traditional degrees"" if they can demonstrate a ""foundational understanding of AI, whether that's knowing how to apply AI to their workflows, or taking ""industry-recognized"" online courses on AI and machine learning.Beyond education and AI experience, Duran said applicants from non-traditional backgrounds can shine if they can ""clearly communicate what makes them stand out"" by emphasizing their career milestones, leadership capabilities, and the impact of their previous projects.In some cases, Shapiro said workers with less conventional backgrounds may have more to offer than those with technical degrees. She said that Jasper hired employees who completed skills-based boot camps and believes that applicants who are career changers can be more equipped for particular roles than those with technical degrees — if they take the initiative to keep up with everything that's happening in generative AI.""It's really valuable to have people come in from different perspectives,"" she said.",,"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Steven Tweedie'}",,,

What, exactly, are soft skills? And why do soft skills even matter, when generative AI seems more skilled than most workers today? Soft skills are things like interpersonal communication, work ethic and other “non-essential” abilities for employees. For example, if you are an architect, hard skills might include working with design software, understanding how air conditioning systems work in large buildings, and being familiar with the fundamentals of earthquake regulations in California. These are hard skills: j0b-related technical knowledge and abilities. Soft skills, like empathy, creativity, integrity, and adaptability might not be as obviously important in your job, they are actually mission-critical for your career. And these skills can’t be outsourced to artificial intelligence, because these soft skills exist inside of you.


In a recent survey, 70% of Gen Z employees report an eager desire to land in the C-Suite, according to Insider. But the path to leadership starts with soft skills. Ambition without effective personal interaction is called “frustration”, as your desires and abilities are not in sync. Instead of wondering what’s missing, access your soft skills - and advance your career in the process.

Soft Skill 1. Learning to Listen
There are three ways to listen. The first is to “listen to affirm” - in other words, so that you can tell someone what their conversation sparks inside of you. Typically, this means referencing something that you’ve learn, read or experienced. This type of listening can be a version of “waiting to talk”, so you can affirm what you already know. The second way to listen is to “listen to defend”. That’s the way that lawyers listen, in a courtroom. When you take a position that’s contrary to what’s being said or offered, you can cut yourself off from possibility, as you wait to counter-punch. Are you really hearing what’s being said? The third way to listen is to “listen to discover”. Discovery points toward what you might learn, gain or uncover inside a conversation. From the standpoint of connection and career advancement, which way do you think is best?

PROMOTED
Soft Skill 2. Presentation Skills
Have you seen a presentation with more “um’s”, “uh’s” and “likes” than you might like? Attention to detail is important in a presentation, which means you have to choose the words that will help you most (and drop the ones that don’t). One key principle of communication: the simplest message is the strongest. Your ability to present your ideas will teach people how to treat you, how to pay you and how to follow your ideas. “Communication,” says Virgin founder, Sir Kenneth Branson, “is the most important skill any leader can possess.”

Soft Skill 3. Resilience and Adaptability
Bouncing back after a challenge is called resilience. Fortunately, for all of us on the other side of the pandemic, we’ve experienced (and accessed) our resilience. Remember the hard times you’ve been through, and notice that you’re still standing. The past reminds us, but it does not define us. We all have the ability to adapt and change. Even when life wasn’t easy, you found a way through. And you can do it again - that’s how adaptability and resilience works. Resilience is remembering. Accessing resilience starts with a reminder: you’re still here. Resilience is inside of you, right now, no matter what you are facing. When we remember that we are often capable of more than we think, we take the first step towards resilience - and away from resistance.

Soft Skill 4. Emotional Intelligence (EQ)
Joanne Frederick, a licensed professional health counselor in Washington, DC, explains what emotional intelligence is: “The ability to use, understand and manage one’s own emotions in a positive way, and to manage stress, communicate effectively, de-escalate issues, problem solve and empathize with other people.” That’s a powerful list of soft skills! Emotions are part of the package of human experience, and managing our emotions is really just a question of focus. Where are you putting your attention, in the midst of challenge, and is that the most intelligent choice you can make right now? Sometimes accessing emotional intelligence is as simple as knowing where to look - and learning what you need to ignore.

Soft Skill 5. Nonverbal Communication / Body Language
How’s your non-verbal communication? Your body language is key to your ability to connect with other human beings - and that connection is important to your career advancement. Body language is used for alignment, confirmation and connection: to see if you really mean what you are saying. Body language creates trust, and that soft skill is key to credibility and connection.

Soft Skill 6. Observing Role Models / Learning
The missing piece, when it comes to soft skills, is having a good role model. That’s according to an article in the Wall Street Journal, called New Grads Have No Idea How to Behave in the Office. Recruiters point to the importance of mentorship, coaching and guidance, so that everyone can understand the nuances of connection, visibility and office politics. Soft skills can’t be outsourced to AI. Machine learning is big, but learning from others is bigger (when it comes to advancing your career). Who’s in your corner, when it’s time to for your promotion? Maybe that’s a career model you need to generate.
Soft Skill 7. Access Accountability
During the pandemic, deadlines slipped and shifted. Flexibility was the name of the game, as work from home initiatives took center stage. Now, deadlines matter more. Getting into the office is often a requirement. Showing up on time and at your best means holding yourself and others accountable. What would be one thing you could change, to keep a promise to yourself, and become more accountable?
Moving forward in your career is about keeping promises - another soft skill that goes by the name of “integrity”. These promises aren’t written in your job description, but they are carved into the way you move forward in your career. Keeping your promises to yourself, and to others, is a soft skill that we all possess. As companies outsource hard skills to AI, investing in soft skills just might be promise of the future. Because there’s no generative AI that can make you keep your promises. Your potential is still your responsibility, and your gift to the world. Promise yourself to access the soft skills that define your talents, your contribution, your integrity... and your humanity. Some things - like your career - don’t need to be outsourced to generative AI.

Embrace AI as a tool, focus on unique skills, and secure your future in accounting. Anees Pretorius of Bean explains how to thrive alongside generative AI in the industry.
Generative AI is already making its presence felt in the $587 billion global accounting industry. And while top firms are excited about the possibilities, many accountants worry that the bulk of their day-to-day work will be automated, leaving them scrambling to find billable hours. But accountants who serve as trusted advisors to their clients and go beyond number-crunching have little to fret about, even in the era of ChatGPT.
As Deloitte launches a new practiceOpens a new window  aimed at harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and PWC announces plans to invest $1 billion in the technology, accountants are understandably excited–but also nervous–as generative AI moves deeper into the industry.
On the one hand, GPTs can automate time-consuming tasks like invoice processing, data entry, tax preparation, expense management, and reconciliation, making every accountant more efficient. Long before ChatGPT emerged, McKinsey Global InstituteOpens a new window  estimated that around 86% of the tasks performed by bookkeepers, accounting, and auditing clerks could be automated. And with GPTs in the picture,  it looks more likely that that percentage of the workload will be automated.
The technology can also take significant work off accountants’ plates by finding patterns and trends in massive amounts of data in seconds, which is exciting.
But there is also fear that this improved efficiency could come at a steep cost. A study by the University of Pennsylvania and OpenAI, which placed accounting at the top of the list of industries exposed to disruption and potential job loss thanks to advancements in AI, did little to assuage the fear.
But as any accountant can tell you, the industry is about far more than simply crunching numbers. The human touch, which can never be automated, is as important as data analysis, trend forecasting, and other important functions.
However, generative AI will cause job losses in the accounting industry, at least in the short term. With this in mind, every accountant should take stock of their current job responsibilities and double down on the work machines will never fully master. In some cases, this will mean learning new skills; in others, it will mean seeing your career and what you have to offer clients in a new light.
Some accountants could be out of a job as generative AI begins to take on more accounting work. But those who hone their focus can have a long, gratifying career in the business.

What Machines Cannot Do?
Algorithms won’t replace human judgment and expertise. In-depth financial analysis, forecasting, and modeling require more than simply separating signal from noise, which AI is great at. They also require the interpretation of data, which is followed by expert recommendations. This requires human beings.
Accountants are indispensable when advising businesses on strategy, longer-term planning, and investment decisions. Critical thinking, creativity, and a grasp of context cannot be automated.
Building and maintaining strong client relationships is the best example of something humans do well, but AI (at least so far) cannot. Empathy, communication, and negotiation skills are critical in many client relationships, and the most successful accountants employ these traits and skills regularly.
Human judgment is also necessary to navigate ethical conundrums and help ensure responsible business practices, as it is to adhere to accounting standards and regulations.
Machines can crunch numbers and often determine appropriate courses of action. However, applying laws, regulations, and other considerations to specific situations takes human acumen. Every client has different needs, so they will still turn to an accountant even if an algorithm is helping in the background.

Preparing for the Future
Accountants must prepare for a future where generative AI is a useful tool – not their replacement. To that end, accounting professionals should:

Be a Strategic advisor, not a number cruncher: High-value services like strategic financial planning, business consulting, risk management, and tax planning are more important than ever. Focus on high-value services. Small and young businesses, including early-stage startups, particularly value the strategic guidance an accountant can offer.
Upgrade your data analysis and technology skills: AI can extract valuable insights from data, so you must be good at this, too. And remember: It won’t be a computer that advises the client on how to use these insights; it will be you. As some tasks are automated, accountants will likely have more face-timeOpens a new window  with clients, and clients will likely have a range of questions about new technologies.
Focus on ethics and compliance: Stay up-to-date on changing regulations and accounting standards. Ethics is not AI’s strong suit. You should aim to provide guidance on responsible technology usage and help clients navigate the complex regulatory, ethical, and legal landscapes. This focus will be especially important if clients work in heavily regulated areas, for example, healthcare or government.
Find new niches: Specialize in specific industries, services, or client segments, and be an expert. Becoming an expert means that your specialized knowledge sets you apart from rivals and AI. The most popularOpens a new window  niche areas for accountants today include real estate, manufacturing, professional services, and healthcare facilities – but these are likely to evolve as time goes on.
Harden up the ‘soft skills’: Building and maintaining strong relationships with clients is the future wave since AI will be performing many more solitary tasks. Client relationship management will be one of the most sought-after skills going forward. The most coveted soft skills will vary by industry, but being able to discuss the future direction of new technologies is a skill that will cut across all business verticals.

You are not alone if you already feel the shockwaves from this powerful new technology. Professionals in every industry assess what they bring and what functions can and cannot be automated.
For accountants, it’s all about going beyond number-crunching, preparing necessary tax and business forms, and serving as a strategic advisor to your clients. Accountants who focus on this are poised to prosper in the future.

					Anees Pretorius is a “recovering accountant” and the Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder at Bean, a SaaS-managed marketplace for specialized accounting services. Driven to elevate the accounting and finance profession into a digital age after his experience in the industry, Anees launched Bean to offer the world’s first digital accounting firm and the largest provider of accounting services— without employing a single accountant.

Before Bean, Anees led audit teams at Deloitte, worked as a consultant for Fortune 1000 companies to assist in their assurance practices, and held leadership roles where he implemented strategic strategies focused on technology and transactions (IPO, Divestitures, M&A). While at Deloitte, he transferred from his home in South Africa to San Francisco, and the proverbial veil was lifted after moving to the biggest economy in the world (the U.S.). It inspired him to think bigger about what is possible within accounting and financial services, and Anees coined the company name Bean as an homage to the “beancounters, ” or accountants, he grew up around in Africa.

Since the adoption of artificial intelligence in the workplace, it has revolutionized business processes like operations and employee engagement and transformed how organizations think about their future. As we look ahead, AI will continue its growth trajectory in both popularity and capabilities.
While these advancements hold great promise, they also carry the responsibility of grappling with AI’s inherent limitations, which could prevent progress in the workplace. Such limitations include algorithmic bias, lack of emotion, creativity challenges and implementation costs. Organizations must comprehend these constraints to fully harness AI’s capabilities. And the new breed of evolving AI — generative AI — will cause significant disruptions across industries and continue to change the way organizations work.
Here are the three main ways I foresee AI developing.

1. Employee Support and Engagement
AI has significantly enhanced employee support and engagement when integrated into workflow structures. When using in-depth analysis of email conversations and biometric data, AI allows employers to better understand employee satisfaction levels, enabling leadership to elevate the employee experience and create a healthier company culture. How does it do this?
AI-powered systems can provide managers with insights about when an employee is facing burnout as they gauge overall sentiment and activity on a daily basis, surpassing traditional tools such as surveys and basic feedback forms. 
For example, AI and natural language processing-powered solutions have the ability to rate the sentiment of a conversation on both Microsoft Teams and Outlook. In doing so, it can rate the conversation in terms of positive, negative or neutral and analyze it over a period to deliver a strong understanding about the employee’s exact sentiment of the workplace.
Employers can also use predictive analysis tools to recommend learning courses and information specific to employee needs and implement improvement action plans without waiting for review meetings.
Looking ahead, AI is set to further revolutionize personalized support and guidance for employees by optimizing workplace-specific algorithms. For instance, AI will incorporate nudging capabilities to identify project misalignments and tasks requiring immediate attention. These workplace-tailored algorithms are meticulously designed to boost productivity, ensuring employees receive timely, customized feedback.
Essentially, AI will enable organizations to shift from reactive to proactive engagement strategies. By implementing AI-based self-assessment tools and personalized recommendations, employees can take ownership of their workplace performance, work-life balance and overall well-being.
 
2. Productivity and Decision-Making
It’s no secret that AI has empowered organizations to make more informed decisions than before, and this will not change. AI-driven decision-making will only grow as AI algorithms provide stronger, more advanced insights that aid such processes. 
Advancements in task automation will continue to streamline repetitive and mundane tasks, freeing employees to dedicate their time to strategic and creative work. Consider a customer support team that previously spent a significant portion of its day manually entering data from customer inquiries. With automation, this time-consuming task is now taken care of, allowing the team to focus on delivering personalized assistance and resolving complex issues more efficiently.
Another area of innovation that has experienced great success thus far is AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants. These tools can be transformative resources for improving the employee experience, and they will undoubtedly continue to excel. While these technologies can’t fully replace the need for human intervention, they will offer more sophisticated capabilities in answering complex queries, understanding emotion and delivering personalized responses. 
As a result of the trust organizations have in AI’s ability to assist with decision-making, we will likely see an increase in AI for cybersecurity. AI will be instrumental in enhancing cybersecurity measures as it proactively identifies and mitigates potential threats to protect company data, allowing leaders to act based on AI-driven decisions.

3. Ethical and Regulatory Considerations
While AI cannot develop its own ethics and regulations, organizations will begin to prioritize ethical AI development and usage further as its adoption in all other areas will continue to grow. There will be an increased focus on AI governance, data privacy, fairness and transparency to address potential biases and AI-related risks. Striking the right balance between innovation and responsibility will be crucial in harnessing the full potential of generative AI for the betterment of workers and employers alike in 2024 and beyond.When it comes to AI, employee support and engagement, productivity and decision-making and ethical and regulatory considerations will set the stage for workplace advancement in 2024. AI’s capabilities are diverse and will continue to flourish as time goes on. As it evolves, businesses will find the advancements necessary to leverage to create a competitive edge, foster a more engaging and inclusive work environment and achieve company growth.

Space Force Temporarily Bans the Use of Generative AI for Its Workforce




Peter Suciu / Oct 19, 2023 














Intelligence  













 

The United States Space Force has banned the use of web-based generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools including ChatGPT for its workforce over security concerns. The sixth and newest branch of the United States military issued a memo at the end of last month that called upon Guardians to stop using the AI tools including large-language models on government computers until they receive formal approval by the force’s Chief Technology and Innovation Office.
Though the ban is reportedly temporary, it was “due to data aggregation risks,” the memo stated. The Air Force has confirmed the ban, which was first reported by Bloomberg.
“An Air Force spokesperson confirmed the temporary ban, which was first reported by Bloomberg.
“A strategic pause on the use of Generative AI and Large Language Models within the U.S. Space Force has been implemented as we determine the best path forward to integrate these capabilities into Guardians’ roles and the USSF mission,” Air Force spokesperson Tanya Downsworth said in a statement, and added, “This is a temporary measure to protect the data of our service and Guardians.”
However, Dr. Lisa Costa, the U.S. Space Force’s chief technology and innovation officer, said in the memo that the technology could serve a purpose in the future. She added that generative AI “will undoubtedly revolutionize our workforce and enhance Guardian’s ability to operate at speed.”
 AI and the DoD
Earlier this year, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) warned that while the private sector has employed AI for years, the Department of Defense (DoD) hasn’t issued department-wide AI acquisitions guidance needed to ensure consistency. The watchdog recommended that the Pentagon develop such guidance and consider private company practices as appropriate.
However, efforts are already moving forward.
In August, the DoD announced the establishment of a generative AI task force, an initiative that reflects the Pentagon’s commitment to harnessing the power of artificial intelligence in a responsible and strategic manner. The DoD recognized that AI has emerged as a transformative technology with the potential to revolutionize various sectors, including defense.
By leveraging generative AI models, which can use vast datasets to train algorithms and generate products efficiently, the DoD aimed to enhance its operations in areas such as warfighting, business affairs, health, readiness, and policy.
Yet, as noted by the Space Force’s pause on its use, concerns remain.
“AI is a new technology, and the risks aren’t well understood, for instance, how is the information being used to train the model assured and protected,” explained technology industry analyst Rob Enderle of the Enderle Group.
Not a Fear of AI
It would be wrong to suggest that the Space Force fears the technology specifically, nor is it simply a matter of security.
“This isn’t so much a fear of AI but the common fear of someone who doesn’t understand the risks implementing a technology that is either unsecured or installed improperly resulting in the potential for a breach,” Enderle told ClearanceJobs. “It isn’t just security either that this kind of policy tries to address because back when Windows 95 was released there were massive outages that occurred because that technology wasn’t properly vetted before implementation. AI’s potential to do harm is far greater than Windows 95, or anything like it ever was, thus a measured approach with the proper approvals and vetting process is required as this policy attempts to assure. I’m actually more surprised this didn’t happen faster than that it happened at all.”
The Space Force’s ban is simply being cautious about new technology that has the potential to do as much harm as good.

Artificial Intelligence Will Transform Legal Profession
10.17.2023
By Susan DeSantis







Panelists at a New York State Bar Association conference predicted that lawyers who are in charge of high-level legal strategies for clients have nothing to fear from artificial intelligence, but the jobs of attorneys who conduct the research and draft the legal documents will change dramatically.
“The battle won’t be between humans and AI but between humans with AI and humans without AI,” said Massimo Sterpi, a partner at Gianni & Origoni in Rome and a member of a panel on artificial intelligence. “Work for lawyers will still be there but at a more complex level. The work is going to become more and more sophisticated.”
Sterpi said that lawyers will want to restructure their fees because generative AI will cut down on the number of hours needed to research and prepare legal documents but will require deep strategic thinking. It will make more sense for lawyers to charge for results rather than hours worked, which in itself would be a dramatic change for the legal profession.
Simple tasks such as drafting rental agreements will be among the 300 million jobs worldwide that Goldman Sachs estimates will be eliminated, Sterpi said. Junior lawyers need to get trained as soon as they can on artificial intelligence and gain higher-level legal skills that automation cannot perform, panelists warned.
“Lawyers who do not embrace artificial intelligence will be replaced,” said Eliseo Roques-Arroyo, managing partner of EDGE Legal in San Juan and another member of the panel on artificial intelligence. “Make no mistake about it. Artificial intelligence is here to stay.”
The speakers were all participating in  the New York State Bar Association’s “Deep Dive into the Metaverse and Web3: The Second Global Law Symposium & Tech Summit, which took place Oct. 16 to 17 at New York University.
Emily Lewis, an associate at ArentFox Schiff in Washington, D.C., who was on a panel on cybersecurity, warned lawyers that ChatGPT, an OpenAI program, should be off limits.
“It’s important to remember that the second you input something into ChatGPT, your attorney-client privilege is broken,” she said.
Instead, firms should create their own AI software to preserve attorney-client privilege, she said. Creating such software is not easy; it requires hiring expert support staff, training lawyers and making clients aware of the role AI is playing. And after all that work is done, lawyers need to understand the limitations.
“You need to be careful to use AI as a tool.  It’s not a substitute,” she said. “But don’t ask it to write a brief for you.”
A case in point is Mata v. Avianca, which prompted New York City lawyer Steven A. Schwartz of the firm Levidow, Levidow & Oberman to use ChatGPT to write a brief. The problem is that ChatGPT made up the cases. Schwartz told  U.S. District Court Judge P. Kevin Castel of the Southern District of New York that he didn’t realize that ChatGPT could invent case law.
Despite such growing pains, Marc Beckman, chief executive officer of DMA United and the moderator of the panel on AI, said lawyers need to embrace AI and other newer technologies. He believes that AI, in particular, will have a positive impact on those in the bottom 30% of U.S. socioeconomic brackets. People who can’t afford legal representation will be better off once they can use AI to get basic legal help, he said.
Christopher Lyon, a partner at Goldberg Segalla in New York City and a member of the AI panel, doesn’t think the transformation will come as quickly as Beckman predicts. Only 30% of attorneys are early adapters of technology, he said. So change will come but lawyers still have time to adapt. “There’s going to be a hundred different ways to integrate AI into the practice,” he said.
One participant at the conference asked why every lawyer has to become familiar with AI rather than rely on specialists within the firm who are the experts.
Roques-Arroyo, the managing partner of EDGE Legal from San Juan, said that won’t work.
“Lawyers have an ethical obligation to be competent in these technologies,” he said. “You have a duty to supervise technology.”
And Roques-Arroyo went even further, “I think I have a duty to disclose to a client if I’m using AI technology. Not doing so will expose you to malpractice.”

Gov. Kathy Hochul is expected to include proposals and give shape to plans for the future of artificial intelligence in New York in January's State of the State, including ideas to regulate the developing technology and expected impacts on the workforce.
Hochul and her staff are meeting with experts to develop proposals related to AI in the coming months.
""Executive Chamber staff and the governor herself are engaged in ongoing discussions with experts inside and outside of government to develop proposals on the big issues facing New Yorkers, including artificial intelligence,"" a spokesperson with Hochul's office said in a statement Thursday. ""The governor will, as always, release a bold comprehensive policy agenda in January as part of the State of the State.""
Hochul announced $20 million to advance AI research in the state at SUNY's first-ever AI Symposium at UAlbany earlier this week. When speaking to reporters at the event, Hochul floated forming a state task force to research the best ways to use AI and safeguard against possible consequences. Officials expect her to release more details about proposals for that task force in her executive budget proposal to be released in early 2024.
Artificial intelligence does not have its own line item in the state budget, and state Budget Division officials say it's difficult to calculate the state's total annual expenses related to the industry.
Assembly members on Thursday held a public hearing in Albany to examine the impact of artificial intelligence on the workforce. Lawmakers said they want to work with business owners and union leaders as artificial intelligence expands in society, and is expected to transform the workplace.
""AI is on the rise and it's here to stay, and it's going to change the world as we know it,"" Assembly Labor Committee chair Latoya Joyner said.
The technology can allow for faster decision-making, but it's not always accurate, or ethical, with potential copyright infringements, privacy concerns and inevitable bias in its algorithms.
""It's accelerating at a pace where it may be used in ways that we don't want as a society and we need to get the checks and balances in place for it,"" said Christopher Ford, council leader and executive board member of state workers' union Public Employees Federation.
State workforce union leaders testified to lawmakers Thursday that workers must be trained for new skills or other positions to avoid job cuts or displacement of employees.
On Monday, Hochul said she's confident the development of AI will not impact the state workforce, citing thousands of open positions.
""No one in our workforce needs to worry about losing a job, I'm trying to find more workers,"" the governor said. ""I just stopped a hiring freeze that had been in place for many years that eviscerated our agencies. I'm trying to hire people.""
But PEF leaders say AI will pose a risk to employees, as managers will eye potential cost savings. 
Union leaders say artificial intelligence was discussed in the latest collective bargaining agreement ratified earlier this year, and that a human must remain accountable for decisions made on the job. 
They warned lawmakers AI should not be used for public assistance, substance use treatment, mental health referrals and other human services.
""There is no price tag you can put on humans, right? That's truly what makes our society move forward,"" Joyner said.
She said the Legislature wants to be cautious with AI and avoid its hazards without suppressing the potential benefits of the unfolding technology.
Proposals regulating artificial intelligence could become a higher priority next session, but lawmakers say they're committed to putting humans first.
Assemblyman Alex Bores says he expects it will be part of upcoming difficult budget conversations as AI can streamline processes and cut costs.
""Where we can save money using AI, we should definitely be looking at it, but where we have to spend to reduce the risks, that will be a top priorioty,"" said Bores, a Manhattan Democrat. ""This is a field that's moving so quickly, we can't just kick it off to future budget cycles.""
Panelists also suggested lawmakers explore imposing a tax on employers that choose to replace staff with AI technology.

As school districts in the Treasure Valley see a rise in the use of artificial intelligence, educators say they’re figuring out ways to ensure the new tools are being used responsibly and don’t impede student learning.School officials in Meridian and Nampa told the Idaho Statesman that they’ve seen students increasingly use AI in their work. In Nampa, administrators have created a task force to recommend to the district any changes or policies to implement. The West Ada School District plans to expand teachers’ resources to allow them the ability to detect AI-generated work, spokesperson Nicole Scheppers told the Statesman by email.“As a district, we are aware of the growing use of AI by students and have taken the role of leading learning toward the use of AI in a responsible manner,” Scheppers said. “West Ada will add ... the ability for teachers to determine areas in student work that may have been AI-generated to ensure we are able to reinforce ethical practices and genuine student learning.”Scheppers said West Ada has also provided guidance for teachers on what qualifies as cheating when students use AI, ways to promote ethical use of it and other resources. She said the district has software that monitors internet access on its devices, lets teachers monitor students’ screens, and identifies potential plagiarism in student work. Scheppers didn’t respond to follow-up questions seeking additional details about the software. Drew Williams, Nampa School District’s K-12 blended learning specialist, told the Statesman the district has seen a rise in students using ChatGPT, a chatbot that uses AI to replicate realistic dialogue, to cheat in the past couple of months. The trend has been most common in language arts classes and at the high-school level, she said.Williams said teachers and faculty have told her that students’ use of ChatGPT has made it challenging to identify how much students really learned, and whether they’re developing problem-solving and critical thinking skills. If teachers suspect students of cheating, she said, they might ask students to provide information on their sources and where they got the information to assess their knowledge in the topic.Because technology is moving fast, Williams said, it will be a slow process of understanding the full impact that ChatGPT and AI technology will have on education. The task force is in the early stages and has no deadline to complete its research, she added. But it plans to seek input from educators and will later open the meetings to students and parents as well.Having a foundation of understanding of how to generate code in a computer science class and how to structure a paragraph effectively by doing their own writing before using tools to help draft, refine, and evaluate are important learning skills for students, Williams said. The Nampa School District currently blocks ChatGPT and other AI tools from school-issued devices for students but not for teachers.“Teachers are figuring this out and everybody’s figuring this out,” Williams said. “Hopefully we can really put together recommendations that will lead us forward and help prepare kids, because that’s what our job is at the end of the day.”The Boise School District didn’t respond to requests for comment.Can AI be used as a learning tool?In West Ada’s statement, Scheppers acknowledged that rapidly developing technology, such as ChatGPT, can be used in responsible ways and can be “powerful tools to assist in the teaching and learning process.”“We want students to develop critical thinking skills that will help students learn to problem solve rather than engage in learning that is solely focused on ‘answer getting,’” Scheppers said. “As educators, it is imperative that we learn about and engage in AI tools.”Yu-hui Ching, associate professor of educational technology at Boise State University, told the Statesman that benefits can arise from the use of ChatGPT and other AI features for educational purposes. Specifically, Ching said AI could aid in reducing teacher burnout following the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, Ching said educators could use AI tools to generate tests and multiple-choice questions.Instead of students using ChatGPT and other AI tools to generate work, Ching said students could instead learn to use the technology as a learning companion. For example, if teachers can’t address the immediate needs of a student and answer questions, then students could instead input a question into an AI tool.“If teachers can learn how to use this generative AI more efficiently in teaching, it has a lot of potential to help fight teacher burnout and help teacher retention,” Ching said.Ching worries that AI is going to affect white collar workers. Ching said she anticipates the fields most affected will be education, journalism, graphic design, software engineering and most computer science programs that require generating code.
