Investment in GAI is substantial, with UK institutions spending between £800K and £1.6m, and US counterparts investing between $2.1m and $5m.Furthermore, a striking 66% of executives anticipate an average revenue increase of 20% due to GAI in the next three years. However, over half of the respondents (57%) expect GAI to lead to job losses, projecting an average workforce reduction of 30% in the next three years.The report is based on responses from senior technology decision-makers in major banks and insurance companies, with a focus on large-scale organisations in both the UK and the US.There’s a marked difference in perceptions of GAI based on age demographics. Younger individuals (aged 25-34) are more likely to see GAI positively compared to older counterparts, with 47% of those aged 55 and above viewing it more as a “foe.”While a sizeable portion of institutions are not yet using GAI, over 50% of the larger firms (with 3,000 or more employees) are currently implementing it. Interestingly, the US is ahead of the UK in terms of investment in GAI.Businesses are yet to reach a consensus on the areas that GAI will most benefit. Customer service, credit checks, lending automation, and market research are all areas being considered for its application.FintechOS co-Founder and CEO Teodor Blidarus said, “GAI is a terrain marked by both excitement and apprehension and our study explores the polarised sentiment that surrounds this groundbreaking technology. While opinions within the financial services industry are deeply divided, there is one common consensus: the expectation that GAI will boost revenues but inevitably reshape the workforce and displace jobs.“Every financial institution has started its GAI journey and it’s imperative to take the first step – even if it’s a small one – to avoid being left behind. Only by starting the journey now, and understanding the implications can be mitigate the risks of GAI and better reap the rewards.”Keep up with all the latest FinTech news here.Copyright © 2023 FinTech Global  Enjoying the stories?Subscribe to our daily FinTech newsletter and get the latest industry news & research                  InvestorsThe following investor(s) were tagged in this article.TAGSfinancial services 2023FintechOSGAI InvestmentGenerative Artificial IntelligenceJob Displacement in FinanceTechnology Decision MakersUK Financial SectorUS Financial SectorPrevious articleMashreq, Visa, and ecolytiq launch carbon banking platform in MENANext articleVolt’s launches real-time payment tech in Australiajhaxell ",https://schema.org,"[{'@type': 'Article', '@id': 'https://fintech.global/2023/11/22/73-of-financial-services-executives-believe-generative-ai-will-take-their-job/#article', 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://fintech.global/2023/11/22/73-of-financial-services-executives-believe-generative-ai-will-take-their-job/'}, 'author': {'name': 'jhaxell', '@id': 'https://fintech.global/#/schema/person/257ea14d5748bee3795ede58dccd8b27'}, 'headline': '73% of financial services executives believe generative AI will take their job', 'datePublished': '2023-11-22T15:35:50+00:00', 'dateModified': '2023-11-22T15:35:50+00:00', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@id': 'https://fintech.global/2023/11/22/73-of-financial-services-executives-believe-generative-ai-will-take-their-job/'}, 'wordCount': 424, 'commentCount': 0, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://fintech.global/#organization'}, 'image': {'@id': 'https://fintech.global/2023/11/22/73-of-financial-services-executives-believe-generative-ai-will-take-their-job/#primaryimage'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://fintech.global/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/brusk-dede-tjd5CfdDPRA-unsplash-scaled.jpg', 'keywords': ['financial services 2023', 'FintechOS', 'GAI Investment', 'Generative Artificial Intelligence', 'Job Displacement in Finance', 'Technology Decision Makers', 'UK Financial Sector', 'US Financial Sector'], 'articleSection': ['FinTech News', 'Industry News'], 'inLanguage': 'en-GB', 'potentialAction': [{'@type': 'CommentAction', 'name': 'Comment', 'target': ['https://fintech.global/2023/11/22/73-of-financial-services-executives-believe-generative-ai-will-take-their-job/#respond']}]}, {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://fintech.global/2023/11/22/73-of-financial-services-executives-believe-generative-ai-will-take-their-job/', 'url': 'https://fintech.global/2023/11/22/73-of-financial-services-executives-believe-generative-ai-will-take-their-job/', 'name': '73% of financial services executives believe generative AI will take their job', 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://fintech.global/#website'}, 'primaryImageOfPage': {'@id': 'https://fintech.global/2023/11/22/73-of-financial-services-executives-believe-generative-ai-will-take-their-job/#primaryimage'}, 'image': {'@id': 'https://fintech.global/2023/11/22/73-of-financial-services-executives-believe-generative-ai-will-take-their-job/#primaryimage'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://fintech.global/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/brusk-dede-tjd5CfdDPRA-unsplash-scaled.jpg', 'datePublished': '2023-11-22T15:35:50+00:00', 'dateModified': '2023-11-22T15:35:50+00:00', 'description': ""The new study by FintechOS titled 'Generative Artificial Intelligence: The Technology Polarising the Financial Services Industry' has found that 73% of financial services executives fear generative AI might replace their jobs eventually."", 'breadcrumb': {'@id': 'https://fintech.global/2023/11/22/73-of-financial-services-executives-believe-generative-ai-will-take-their-job/#breadcrumb'}, 'inLanguage': 'en-GB', 'potentialAction': [{'@type': 'ReadAction', 'target': ['https://fintech.global/2023/11/22/73-of-financial-services-executives-believe-generative-ai-will-take-their-job/']}]}, {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'inLanguage': 'en-GB', '@id': 'https://fintech.global/2023/11/22/73-of-financial-services-executives-believe-generative-ai-will-take-their-job/#primaryimage', 'url': 'https://fintech.global/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/brusk-dede-tjd5CfdDPRA-unsplash-scaled.jpg', 'contentUrl': 'https://fintech.global/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/brusk-dede-tjd5CfdDPRA-unsplash-scaled.jpg', 'width': 2560, 'height': 1707, 'caption': '73% of financial services executives believe generative AI will take their job'}, {'@type': 'BreadcrumbList', '@id': 'https://fintech.global/2023/11/22/73-of-financial-services-executives-believe-generative-ai-will-take-their-job/#breadcrumb', 'itemListElement': [{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Fintech', 'item': 'https://fintech.global/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': '73% of financial services executives believe generative AI will take their job'}]}, {'@type': 'WebSite', '@id': 'https://fintech.global/#website', 'url': 'https://fintech.global/', 'name': 'FinTech Global', 'description': 'Essential FinTech Intelligence &amp;

The landscape of work is undergoing a profound transformation, driven by rapid advancements in technology, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence. This evolution is not just a fleeting trend but a fundamental shift in how businesses operate and compete. AI, especially in its generative forms, is redefining job roles, skill requirements, and the very nature of work itself.


Writing in the Human Resource Management Journal, professors David Guest and Vijay Pereira of King’s College London and France’s NEOMA Business School respectively, drew attention to the evolving dynamics of AI in business. They highlighted that the increasing integration of AI technologies in business processes presents both new opportunities and challenges for organizations and their leaders.

In an interview, Pereira told me: “Evaluating the outcomes of AI concerns the extent to which a successful balance has been achieved between the technical and the social systems to ensure that the needs and mutual gains of stakeholders are addressed and that it leads to a good quality of working life with spill over effects into the community and beyond.”

PROMOTED
However, realizing this equilibrium requires a comprehensive reevaluation of workplace strategies, structures, and skills—an approach crucial for maximizing AI’s benefits, ensuring sustainable growth, and maintaining a competitive edge. This view is supported by Natalia Weisz, an expert in adaptive leadership who studied at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University—where she also served as invited faculty for the Executive Program of Adaptive Leadership Development. In an interview Weisz—who recently authored Strategy as Leadership published by Stanford University Press—told me, leaders need to foster an environment of ongoing learning and patience—acknowledging the challenges in emotional and skill development during AI integration.

“This entails leaders promoting a serene, learning-oriented atmosphere, honing AI competencies, steering clear of quick fixes, and adeptly handling the emotional dynamics of change, both at individual and collective levels,” she said.

LinkedIn’s report indicates a substantial increase in AI-centric roles, with ‘Head of AI’ positions tripling globally in the last five years. Additionally, job postings mentioning AI have more than doubled in the past two years. This trend points to the growing importance of AI in the business world and the need for specialized leadership in this area. By 2030, it is expected that the skills required for many jobs will change by at least 65%, suggesting a shift towards AI proficiency in the workforce, which is consistent with previous research.

European business leaders are largely optimistic about the impact of AI on their workforce. The majority believe that AI will benefit their employees by automating routine tasks, thereby increasing productivity and allowing more time for creative and strategic thinking—a shift which could lead to enhanced job satisfaction and more fulfilling work experiences.
The study also shows a significant increase in professionals seeking to improve their AI skills. There has been an 80% increase in members watching AI-related learning courses on LinkedIn over the past three months, and a 60% month-over-month increase in Generative AI skills being added to members’ profiles since January 2023. This trend highlights the growing recognition of the importance of AI proficiency in the modern job market. For leaders, these findings have several implications:
Investment In AI Leadership And Skills Development
As AI becomes increasingly integral to business operations, leaders must prioritize the development of AI-centric roles within their organizations. This involves not only creating new positions, such as ‘Head of AI’, but also ensuring that existing roles evolve to incorporate AI-related responsibilities. Investing in AI leadership means identifying and nurturing talent that can drive AI initiatives effectively. It’s about having the right people in place who can understand the nuances of AI technologies and how they can be applied strategically to benefit the organization.
Moreover, fostering a culture of continuous learning and skill development is essential. As AI technologies evolve, so too must the skills of the workforce. Leaders should facilitate ongoing education and training programs to help employees stay abreast of the latest AI developments and techniques. This could involve partnerships with educational institutions, access to online courses, or in-house training programs. By investing in their employees’ AI literacy, organizations not only enhance their capabilities but also demonstrate a commitment to their workforce’s professional growth, which can improve employee retention and satisfaction.
Strategic Planning for AI Integration
Integrating AI into business processes requires thoughtful and strategic planning. Leaders must first understand the potential of AI to automate tasks and enhance productivity. This involves identifying processes that are ripe for automation and understanding how AI can improve these processes. For example, AI can be used for data analysis, customer service, inventory management, and more. The key is to identify areas where AI can bring the most value and then develop a roadmap for implementation.
This strategic planning also involves considering the broader implications of AI integration, such as the impact on employee roles, changes in workflow, and potential cost savings or revenue opportunities. Leaders must also be mindful of ethical considerations and ensure that AI is used responsibly and transparently. Effective integration of AI requires a balance between technological possibilities and the human elements of business operations.
Adapting to a Changing Job Market
The rapid evolution of the job market due to AI advancements necessitates proactive adaptation from leaders. This means reevaluating existing job roles and considering how they might change or become obsolete with the advent of AI. Leaders must be forward-thinking, anticipating the skills in demand and preparing their workforce accordingly. This could involve retraining employees for new roles that AI creates or upskilling them to work alongside AI technologies.
Embracing new technologies is also crucial. Leaders should stay informed about the latest AI developments and be open to adopting new tools and platforms that can give their organization a competitive edge. This also means fostering an organizational culture that is open to change and innovation.
Finally, preparing the workforce for the changes AI will bring is about more than just skills training; it is about helping employees navigate the psychological and emotional aspects of working with AI. This includes addressing fears about job displacement and helping employees see AI as a tool that can enhance their work rather than replace it. By taking a holistic approach to adapting to a changing job market, leaders can ensure their organizations and employees are well-prepared for the future of work.

A.I… The two letters you can’t seem to escape. It seems like everyone in your inbox, your LinkedIn feed and your boardroom is discussing the consequences of AI-powered technology and how it’s radically disrupting the status quo in business, IT and, well, everything. But what are the real implications for your bottom line? How can generative AI help your company save time and money in a real way?
The best way to untangle the hype from the reality of AI is this: focus first on the existing issues that need to be addressed in your organization, rather than getting lost in hypothetical future advances.
Working ‘forward’ into an unknown future leads to confusion, but starting with tangible problems and pain points and working ‘backward’ helps locate where AI-enablement is needed. When it comes to ERP test automation, there’s one specific category of AI making waves: generative AI, a subset of artificial intelligence that can create new and original content, like writing, images, music or even software tests by learning from existing examples. Why is it so innovative and dynamic? Because this tech is able to take in information and use its own reasoning to draw new conclusions. The ability to ideate new outcomes gives AI a depth and creative operability that is lacking in traditional automation and computerization, with considerable consequences for testing automation.
Reframe AI as an electronic Swiss Army knife, able to potentially help and improve on situations if applied in the correct way. With that in mind, AI software can enhance the ERP testing lifecycle at every stage, boosting efficiency in multiple ways:
Automated efficiency
AI-powered test automation tools excel at analyzing large amounts of data and uncovering patterns, resulting in more comprehensive test coverage. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on predetermined test cases, AI automation intelligently designs test scenarios that closely mimic real-world user interactions. This not only covers critical functionalities but also uncovers hidden defects, ensuring robust software quality.
Intelligent test case generation
AI automation brings the advantage of automatic test case generation. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, AI tools analyze extensive data sets to identify patterns and dependencies. Through understanding the application’s various paths and scenarios, AI can generate relevant test cases without human intervention, saving time for testers and allowing them to focus on something else.
Quicker defect detection 
AI-powered automation tools expedite defect detection by continuously analyzing data and providing real-time insights during test execution, resulting in quicker resolutions. Machine learning algorithms identify abnormal behaviors and patterns, enabling prompt problem identification. By empowering developers with these new abilities, debugging time is greatly reduced, thus saving money by preventing defects from leaving the production line. This is the road most-traveled when considering the many possibilities of AI, since manual methods of searching for defects are notoriously cumbersome.
Self-repairing capabilities
AI-driven test automation is capable of self-learning and adapting to changes, providing resilience and efficiency. These automation tools can recognize when an element’s properties change and automatically update the test scripts accordingly.  The capability to self-repair means maintenance efforts are reduced, saving time and resources while also allowing the automation suite to remain up-to-date.
Constant improvement and optimization
AI-powered analytics enable test automation frameworks to continually analyze results and optimize test suites. After gathering the necessary data, AI algorithms can identify redundant or ineffective test cases and suggest improvements for maximum efficiency. This iterative process empowers companies to constantly enhance their testing strategies, resulting in substantial savings in both time and cost.
Embrace the machine 
Generative AI holds the potential to speed up software testing, and gives suggestions on how to streamline the process. It is also able to check for defects and breakages to a degree that would be impossible for a human mind in the same amount of time. In a world where system downtime can cost an organization up to $300,000 per hour, that peace of mind is valuable.
Overall, where are we headed? Into a brave new world of extreme efficiency, where human error no longer causes major disruptions and snarls in “business as usual”. Applying artificial intelligence solutions into your ERP environment is not a single, one-size-fits-all event; it’s a matter of finding your pain points and bottlenecks and applying the technology as-needed.

But would you trust a well-meaning AI assistant that can sometimes offer plausible yet inaccurate answers? And does anyone else see the queries that you submit, and if so, who? In other words, how safe is ChatGPT?ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) can provide opportunities at home and at work for efficiencies and improvements – but alongside these opportunities come risks around not just accuracy and bias, but the handling of personal information and security too. Here’s how to use ChatGPT safely for all your needs.Taking care with AI inaccuracy and biasTraining ChatGPT works by giving it previously unseen data sets to establish how well it makes predictions as it reviews the data. Then it is tested to see how well it performs with that new data. As such, its ability to supply quality information is only as good as the information that was given to it, and the current version of ChatGPT is only trained on data up to 2021. The data that feeds LLMs is likely to contain conflicting evidence, opinions and unreliable conclusions, and so bias issues are as inevitable as accuracy issues. DiscoverHow is the World Economic Forum creating guardrails for Artificial Intelligence? Show moreIn response to the uncertainties surrounding generative AI and the need for robust AI governance frameworks to ensure responsible and beneficial outcomes for all, the Forum’s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (C4IR) has launched the AI Governance Alliance. The Alliance will unite industry leaders, governments, academic institutions, and civil society organizations to champion responsible global design and release of transparent and inclusive AI systems. For personal and business use, the key to navigating accuracy and bias issues with ChatGPT is vigilance. Fact-checking statistics, using multiple sources for information, and engaging critically with AI-generated content with the understanding that generative AI may not understand complex or nuanced topics can mitigate accuracy issues.Because LLMs can only work with the data that is given to them – and as long as that data creates inaccuracies and bias – humans will need to be involved in the process to identify and remove them, says the Harvard Business Review.Vigilance with personal or sensitive informationEven though website visits are down for the third consecutive month, ChatGPT still had 180.5 million unique users in August 2023, and students returning to school in September may lead to a bump in traffic, as the education sector cautiously embraces AI. Many free apps and websites make their money by collecting and selling data, and ChatGPT operates in a similar way. Ensuring safety around your personal data, your children’s data, or the organization you work for is an important part of online security best practice.

In the age of AI, it's problem-finding that countsChatGPT does not store user-specific data, nor does it store details of interactions beyond the immediate conversation it is having. But it does save all of the conversations you have with it, store them, and utilize this data to improve its language model. So the human trainers working behind the scenes at OpenAI will be able to see conversations and queries. To ensure a safer environment for your personal information and security, avoid sharing private information with ChatGPT. Consider disabling chat history and model training. But be aware that even if you disable the history, your chats will still be stored on Open AI’s servers for 30 days so that staff can monitor for abuse. And if you feel like this is not enough, you can request to delete your entire account and its data by emailing dsar@openai.com.Lastly, take care when installing extensions and apps on your computer or phone. Some apps and browsers that claim to bring ChatGPT functionality to your browser could be harvesting your data.The global AI market is expected to reach $2 trillion by 2030. Image: StatistaHow organizations can use AI safelyFor organizations using generative AI such as ChatGPT as part of their day-to-day operations, making sure both their staff and their customers are clear on the boundaries of use is a good first step, and many organizations provide clear and transparent AI policies to ensure best practices. For organizations looking to build their own LLM AI policies, the Corporate Governance Institute provides some guidance for areas to cover. “Incorporating cyber-resilience governance into [a company’s] business strategy is one of the most impactful principles when it comes to cyber resilience,” notes the World Economic Forum’s latest Global Cybersecurity Outlook report.

73% of UK insurance executives anticipate that Generative AI (GAI) will eventually take their jobs, according to a new study launched by FintechOS.
The firm’s new study, ‘Generative Artificial Intelligence: The Technology Polarising the Financial Services Industry’, unveils a host of varied opinions among UK insurance companies on the expectations, implementation, and impact of this fast-developing technology.
As per FintechOS, approximately 25% of those surveyed described themselves as “frightened”, while 23% admitted to feeling “curious” about GAI.
When asked whether they viewed the technology as friend or foe, 42% opted for “friend”, with 46% stating “foe”. FintechOS observed that 44% of UK insurance organisations are already utilising GAI in their workplace. Additionally, 48% are investing in GAI research, and 39% in its implementation.
The study also found that 66% of insurance executives anticipate an average 20% increase in revenue due to GAI within the next three years, with a fifth putting this figure even higher at 31-40%.

“Amid these often-conflicting views, there is one common consensus: the expectation that GAI will inevitably reshape the workforce and displace jobs,” FintechOS said.
The firm added, “More than half of UK insurers (60%) believe that GAI will result in job losses at their organisations, with an average headcount reduction of 30% over the next three years. The majority (73%) of UK banking executives expect their jobs will eventually be replaced by GAI.”
Commenting on the findings, Teodor Blidarus, co-founder and CEO at FintechOS, said, “GAI is a terrain marked by both excitement and apprehension, and our study explores the polarised sentiment that surrounds this groundbreaking technology.
“While opinions within the insurance industry are deeply divided, there is one common consensus: the expectation that GAI will boost revenues but inevitably reshape the workforce and displace jobs.”
Blidarus added, “Every insurance company has started its GAI journey and it’s imperative to take the first step – even if it’s a small one – to avoid being left behind.
“Only by starting the journey now and understanding the implications can we mitigate the risks of GAI and better reap the rewards.”
FintechOS’ study is based on a survey of senior technology decision-makers within major banks and insurance companies, with more than 1,000 employees, operating in both the United Kingdom and the United States.
The survey was commissioned by FintechOS and was conducted by independent research company Censuswide over three weeks in August 2023.

What the data says about Americans’ views of artificial intelligence
By Michelle Faverio and Alec Tyson

(d3sign/Getty Images)
From detecting cancer on a medical scan to drafting an essay for a school assignment, artificial intelligence is increasingly shaping the way Americans live.

Pew Research Center surveys show that Americans are increasingly cautious about the growing role of AI in their lives generally. Today, 52% of Americans are more concerned than excited about AI in daily life, compared with just 10% who say they are more excited than concerned; 36% feel a mix of excitement and concern.
Despite these cautious overall views, Americans see some specific uses of AI positively, and attitudes depend a great deal on the context of how and why AI is being used.
This post summarizes what we know so far about how Americans view AI in everyday life, the workplace, and health and medicine.
How we did this
This Pew Research Center analysis examines Americans’ views and experiences with artificial intelligence. The analysis draws primarily from recent surveys conducted by the Center. Links to these surveys, including information about the field dates, sample sizes and other methodological details, can be found in the text of the analysis.

Public awareness of AI
The vast majority of Americans (90%) say they’ve heard at least a little about artificial intelligence, according to an August 2023 survey. However, only one-in-three say they’ve heard a lot about it.
While most people are aware of AI, Americans’ ability to identify specific uses of the technology is still developing. Only 30% of U.S. adults correctly recognize all six examples of AI in everyday life that we asked about in a December 2022 survey.
And not everyone brings the same level of understanding. Adults with a college or postgraduate degree are more likely to be familiar with AI than those with less education. There are also significant differences by gender and age, with men and younger adults being more familiar with AI than women and older adults.
Views and experiences with ChatGPT
Generative AI, or programs that can produce text and images, garnered wide media attention in 2023. One prominent example of this technology is ChatGPT. We found in March 2023 that 58% of U.S. adults have heard of ChatGPT, while 42% have heard nothing at all about it.
As with awareness of AI generally, familiarity with ChatGPT is higher among men, younger adults and those with a college or postgraduate degree. 
Even though a majority of Americans are aware of the program, firsthand experience with it is relatively uncommon. Just 18% of all U.S. adults say they’ve used ChatGPT.
AI in schooling

We asked U.S. teens ages 13 to 17 about the program in a fall 2023 survey. We found that 67% are familiar with ChatGPT. And 19% of those teens say they have used it to help with their schoolwork.
Most teens who’ve heard of ChatGPT say it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT to research new things (69%). But fewer say the same about using it for things like solving math problems (39%). And a majority (57%) say it is not acceptable to use it to write essays.
Views of AI in the workplace

In 2022, 19% of American workers were in jobs that are most exposed to AI, based on a Center analysis of government data. Those jobs tend to be in higher-paying fields where a college degree and analytical skills can be a plus.
Our December 2022 survey shows 62% of Americans believe AI will have a major impact on workers generally. However, far fewer think it will impact them personally in a major way (28%).
A majority of U.S. adults oppose using AI to make final hiring decisions or track workers’ movements on the job. In fact, 66% of Americans say they would not want to apply for a job with an employer who uses AI to help with hiring decisions. But there’s more openness to using AI in other ways, like monitoring workers’ driving while they make trips for work or tracking attendance.
Views of AI in health and medicine
Health and medicine is one area where many Americans may encounter artificial intelligence. AI is increasingly being used to do things like help diagnose disease and recommend treatment.
Yet six-in-ten Americans say they would feel uncomfortable with their health care provider relying on AI to help care for them.

More broadly, the public is divided on the impact of AI in health and medicine. While 38% say it will lead to better outcomes for patients, 33% say it will lead to worse outcomes and 27% say it won’t make much difference. One widely expressed concern is that AI will make patients’ personal relationships with their providers worse.
While Americans are cautious about the use of AI in health and medicine generally, they support some specific uses. For instance, 65% say they would want AI to be used in their own skin cancer screening. Studies have found some AI software to be highly accurate at detecting skin cancer.
Support for oversight and regulation of AI
By and large, Americans back regulation and oversight of emerging AI technologies, including chatbots and driverless vehicles.
For example, 67% of those who are familiar with chatbots like ChatGPT say they are more concerned that the government will not go far enough in regulating their use than that it will go too far. A much smaller share (31%) takes the opposite view.

When it comes to AI-powered driverless vehicles, 87% of Americans want them held to a higher testing standard than other passenger vehicles. Americans also commonly express unease around the unanticipated consequences and risks of these technologies. About three-quarters (76%) think it’s likely that the computer systems in driverless vehicles could be easily hacked, putting safety at risk.
A related concern is over the pace of AI adoption in society. In health and medicine, for instance, 75% of Americans think health care providers will move too fast using AI, before fully understanding the potential risks.
Common concerns – and sources of excitement – about AI
While the specific uses of AI matter a lot in how Americans feel about it, we see some common themes in what people like and don’t like about AI.
On the positive side
There are generally higher levels of support for AI when it is used to help with routine or basic tasks. A majority (57%) of Americans say they would be excited for AI to perform household chores, while just 19% express concern about this. Saving time or helping handle mundane tasks are also common reasons for excitement about AI.
Americans are also pretty positive when it comes to AI’s ability to help people find products and services they are interested in online. 
And while experts debate how AI will influence bias in society around things like race and gender, there are signs that the public is more optimistic than pessimistic. For example, among U.S. adults who see a problem with racial and ethnic bias in health and medicine, more think the use of AI would make the issue of bias better than worse (51% vs. 15%). Similarly, among those who see bias in hiring as an issue, more think AI would improve the problem of bias based on job applicants’ race or ethnicity than say it would worsen it (53% vs. 13%).
On the negative side
There’s broad concern about the loss of the human element due to emerging AI technologies, especially in settings like the workplace and health care. Many Americans who would not want to apply for a job that uses AI in the hiring process cite a lack of the “human factor” in hiring as the reason why. In health and medicine, a majority of Americans think relying more on AI would hurt patients’ relationships with their providers.
The potential for negative impacts on jobs is another common concern with AI. Among those who say they’re more concerned than excited about AI, the risk of people losing their job is cited most often as the reason why. We also see this concern with some specific examples of AI. For example, 83% of Americans think driverless cars would lead to job loss for ride-share and delivery drivers.
Surveillance and data privacy are also concerns when discussing AI. Large majorities of Americans who are aware of AI think that as companies use AI, personal information will be used in unintended ways and ways people are not comfortable with.

Work & Technology Correspondent







One year after the launch of ChatGPT, more than 300,000 people in Ireland have used artificial intelligence at work, according to new research from Deloitte.
The study found that over 60% of people in Ireland have heard of Generative AI, with 33% having used the technology.
Among those who were aware of the technology, over three in five believed that Generative AI will reduce the number of jobs available in the future and almost half of respondents said they are concerned that Generative AI will replace some of their role in the workforce in the future.
More than one in ten respondents, reported having used Generative AI tools for work.
Deloitte's research also found that of those who have used Generative AI, more than one in three believe it always produces factually accurate responses and 31% agree that its responses are unbiased.
""As we approach the first anniversary of ChatGPT’s launch, it is interesting that Deloitte research finds that over 300,000 people in Ireland have used the technology for work purposes,"" said Partner Risk Advisory with Deloitte Colm McDonnell.
""By far the most popular purpose of using Generative AI is for personal purposes while 34% of respondents use it for education.""
""It is clear from these responses that the use of Generative AI will only increase with time and greater adoption,"" Mr McDonnell said.
The research is part of Deloitte’s Global Digital Consumer Trends survey, a multi-country study of digital service users worldwide.
The 2023 global study comprises 28,350 respondents across 18 countries and three continents.
The Irish data is based on a survey of 1,000 adults which was conducted in September.

SnapLogic’s Chief Scientist Greg Benson reveals his predictions on Generative AI and the challenges and opportunities it presents in the year ahead.Prediction 1 – Generative AI won’t take your job, but it might change itIn 2024, Generative AI won’t lead to mass job displacements and redundancies, as many early sensationalist reports suggested. Generative AI won’t completely replace experts in any field, as although models have access to an insurmountable amount of information, users still have to articulate concepts well enough to get the right answers. Thus, expertise, human input, and, more importantly, human review will always be necessary.Collaboration with Generative AI is a trend we expect to continue in 2024 as businesses capitalize on the technology’s benefits, reaping the rewards of increased productivity and improved quality of content. Those rewards mean greater adoption of more Generative AI tools, with the goal not to replace workers but to assist them.  Prediction 2 – Now that we’ve invented Generative AI, the next step is understanding itSnapLogic’s Chief Scientist Greg BensonNext year, we can expect to see businesses attempt to improve the consistency of output from Generative AI. Currently, there is no rule book to achieve great results with Generative AI; there are tips and tricks you can deploy for better or faster results, but overall, the process is largely trial and error.Interacting with Generative AI in its current iteration is like a science experiment – you come up with a hypothesis and continue to test different manners of prompts until it produces the result you’re looking for. In the future, experimentation will focus on figuring out how we evaluate the responses it gives us and using that data to inform prompts further.Companies that want to apply Generative AI to their products will need to think about how they evolve prompts that improve results directly. Qualitative and quantitative improvements can only be brought about by re-evaluating their AI application and development approaches.Prediction 3 –Expect an onslaught of Generative AI tools and Generative AI startups.In 2024, we will see another year of the AI market expanding, with more variety as Generative AI startups try to find their niche.SYNCRON STRENGTHENS SUPPLY CHAIN CAPABILITY WITH SNAPLOGICAaron Raj | 24 November, 2023Rather than consolidation, more Generative AI solutions will continue to pop up in different industries. Of course, there will be a lot of attempts that don’t get traction or just don’t work, but this won’t deter the wave of opportunistic entrepreneurs and businesses looking to capitalize on the Generative AI wave.There’s already the start of a huge race in hardware, too: companies such as Google and AWS are building their own AI hardware to compete with Nvidia. If successful, advances in hardware could lead to another explosion in how large language models are trained, as currently, it takes a lot of human input, money, and effort to build from the ground up.In 2024, we will see another year of the AI market expanding, with more variety as Generative AI startups try to find their niche. (Image generated by AI)Prediction 4 – Generative AI regulation is essential to adoption.Regulating Generative AI will be a huge focus for governing bodies and business leaders in 2024. Earlier this year, calls were heard from many industry figures for a pause in AI development. However, that’s not realistic as the fundamental technology is increasingly available through open-source models on Hugging Face. Rather than focusing on halting development, creating clear regulations, guidelines, and best-use practices will be necessary to ensure partnership with AI will move forward safely and securely.Like any other technology, defining safe boundaries will allow leveraging the benefits without sacrificing progress. We can liken this to all manner of regulated tools and equipment; for example, we don’t stop ourselves from building cars that go fast, but we do put speed limits in place to ensure safety. Internationally, governments will focus first on areas of regulation that present the greatest impact on citizens, including frontier AI.SNAPLOGIC EXPANDS ‘SNAPGPT’ GENERATIVE AI CAPABILITIES WITH AMAZON BEDROCKMuhammad Zulhusni | 6 October, 2023From an industry perspective, the Generative AI applications and use cases that are most helpful will emerge as front runners for wider business use. Understanding the risks, challenges, and security issues potentially imposed by these tools will be vital for businesses to understand exactly when and how these tools need to be regulated internally. Likewise, companies hoping to leverage Generative AI will have to communicate to customers exactly how it’s used and how it complies with current and future regulations.Prediction 5 – Generative AI and Legacy technology: Why the key to modernization may reside in Generative AI tools.After a year of Generative AI practice, legacy businesses are starting to understand that Generative AI interest is not just driven by hype and could be transformative in their sector. Therefore, in 2024, we can expect more traditional businesses to deploy the technology to help evolve legacy systems and modernize their technology stacks.Typically, traditional companies are not amenable to change or agile enough to adopt the latest in technology. Many companies are tied to legacy software due to a combination of outdated procurement processes, familiarity, or concerns about data loss or disruption, making modernization inaccessible. The key here is that Generative AI can assist with migrating from old code bases and technology stacks to modern programming languages and platforms.However, Generative AI could bridge the gap by allowing companies previously locked into legacy systems to access a more modern workforce’s knowledge and work practices. Generative AI also makes some modern tools far more user-friendly and, therefore, more likely to be deployed in businesses.Students will also interact with Generative AI on a greater scale. (Image by generative AI)Prediction 6 – AI and the question of originalityNext year, we’ll see the average person become more adept at using AI in their business and personal lives. Students will also interact with Generative AI on a greater scale.On the one hand, ChatGPT and others can be great personal tutors to help students understand concepts. On the other, ChatGPT can be used to generate solutions to problems. I tell my students that they can use Generative AI to help them as they learn, but they must turn in original work. It is extremely tempting to have Generative AI provide answers or just partial answers. Since answers come from a computer program and not another student, it distances students from the notion they are cheating. So far, for my classes in computer systems, it has been fairly easy to determine if a student has turned in Generative AI-generated solutions because they don’t follow the code conventions I’ve taught in class and require in student solutions.How Generative AI is used in classrooms is very much a work in progress. At the moment, there’s still no best practice model – even at my university, we have workshops about AI, but no succinct policy. Beyond the classroom is the larger question of intellectual property and how Generative AI is trained on internet-accessible creations and work. This will play out in all industries and the courts in 2024.Prediction 7 – Universities will begin to teach prompt engineeringIn 2024, universities will teach prompt engineering as a minor field of study and through certificate programs. Prompt engineering for Generative AI is a skill already augmenting the work of domain experts, similar to how computing augments other domains. The successful use of large language models (LLMs) relies heavily on giving the models the right prompts. When looking to fill the role of a prompt engineer, the task becomes finding a domain expert who can formulate a question with examples in a specific domain. That’s a skill critical for today’s IT professionals to successfully implement LLMs. Given this, universities will introduce new academic focus areas to address the growing demand for professionals with specific skills to build the next generation of Generative AI applications.About SnapLogic SnapLogic is the leader in generative integration.

Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools like ChatGPT based on Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the ways we think, learn and work. 
But, like some other forms of AI, GenAI technologies have a black box nature — meaning it’s hard to explain and understand how mathematical models compute their output. 
If we as a society are to employ this new technology on a broad scale, we will need to engage in a collective discovery process to better understand how it works and what it is capable of. 
As AI experts work on making AI systems more comprehensible to end users, and as OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, navigates leadership shakeups and questions about its strategic direction, post-secondary institutions have a critical role to play in enabling collective learning about GenAI.

Difficult to understand
For AI systems based on large neural networks with a black box nature, like GenAI, a lack of transparency makes it difficult for people to trust the AI and to rely on it for sensitive applications.
Carnegie Mellon University professor Elizabeth A. Holm has argued that black box AIs can still be valuable if they produce better results than alternatives, if the cost of wrong answers is low or if they inspire new ideas. 
Still, cases of matters gone horribly wrong erode trust, such as when ChatGPT got tricked into giving instructions to make a bomb, or when it accused a law professor of a serious crime he didn’t commit. 
This is why researchers working on AI explainability have tried to devise techniques to see into the black box of neural networks. However, the LLMs behind many GenAI tools are just too large and too complex for these methods to work.



Universities should lead learning about different ways to use GenAI.

Fortunately, LLMs like ChatGPT have an interesting feature that previous black box neural networks did not have: they are interactive. Think of it this way: we cannot understand what a person is thinking by looking at a map of the neurons in their brain, but we can talk to them.

‘Machine psychology’
A new field of science is emerging under the label of “machine psychology” to understand how LLMs actually “think.” 
New research, yet to be peer reviewed, is examining how these models can surprise us with their emergent capabilities. For example, researchers surmised that because with LLMs every new word generated depends on the sequence of words that came before it, asking an LLM to work through a problem step by step may produce better results. 
New studies, not yet peer reviewed, on this “chain of thought” technique and variations of it have shown they improve outcomes. Others suggest LLMs can be “emotionally manipulated” by including phrases like “are you sure?” or “believe in your abilities” in prompting. 
In an interesting combination of these two methods, Google DeepMind researchers recently found that for a series of math problems, one LLM improved its accuracy significantly when it was prompted with “take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.”

      ChatGPT's greatest achievement might just be its ability to trick us into thinking that it's honest




Collective discovery
Understanding GenAI is not something only researchers are doing, and that’s a good thing. New discoveries that users have made have surprised even the makers of those tools, in both delightful and alarming ways.
Users are sharing their discoveries and prompts in online communities such as Reddit, Discord and dedicated platforms such as FlowGPT. 
These prompts often include “jailbreak” prompts that succeed in getting GenAI tools to behave in ways they are not supposed to. People can trick AI into bypassing built-in rules — for example, producing hateful content — or creating malware.  
These rapid advances and surprising outcomes are why some AI leaders called for a six-month moratorium on AI development earlier this year.
AI and learning
In higher education, an overly defensive approach emphasizing flaws and weaknesses of GenAI or how it allows students to cheat is ill-advised.

      ChatGPT and cheating: 5 ways to change how students are graded




On the contrary, as workplaces start to see the benefits of GenAI-powered employees or workplace productivity, they will expect higher education to prepare students. Students’ education needs to be relevant.   
Universities are ideal spaces to forge co-operation across research fields, an imperative of developing responsible AI. Universities, in contrast to the private sector, are best positioned to embed their GenAI practices and content within a framework of ethical and responsible practice.
One thing this entails is understanding of GenAI as an augment, not a substitute, for human judgement and discerning when relying on this is permissable and acceptable. 
Educating for GenAI involves developing critical thinking and fact-checking skills, and ethical prompt engineering. It also involves understanding that GenAI tools do not just repeat their training data, and can generate new, and high-quality ideas based on patterns in that data.
The ChatGPT and AI for Higher Education UNESCO Quick Guide is a helpful starting point.

Including GenAI in the curriculum cannot be treated as top-down teaching. Given the rapid development and newness of the technology, many students are already ahead of the professors in their GenAI knowledge and skills. We must recognize this as an era of collective discovery, where we are all learning from each other. 
In the “Generative AI and Prompting” course offered at the Haskayne School of Business, University of Calgary, a portion of grades are allocated to posting, commenting and voting on an online “discovery forum” to share their discoveries and experiments.

Learning by doing and experimenting
Lastly, we should be learning how to use GenAI for tackling humanity’s greatest challenges, such as climate change, poverty, disease, international conflict and systemic injustice.
Given the powerful nature of this technology, and the fact that we do not fully understand it due to its black box nature, we should do what we can to understand it through interaction and learning by doing and experimenting.
This is not an effort that can be confined to the works of specialized researchers or AI companies. It requires broad participation.

Artificial intelligence will be a game changer for headhunting. In a conversation with Nancy Xu, the founder and CEO of Moonhub, an AI recruiting company, Xu detailed how automation and machine learning will radically change the recruitment process and improve the candidate and job hunter experience.


“My passion for AI stemmed from realizing its outsized societal impact,” Xu stated. “I'm driven by the fundamental belief that talent is universal, but opportunities aren't. I started to think, how could I use AI to democratize access to jobs and get people hired because of their talent and not just pedigree?” She lamented, “On one hand, I could help really talented people find better, more fulfilling jobs, and I could help companies that are solving important problems get matched with the best talent to do those jobs.”

Xu is on a mission to make Moonhub, backed by investors including Day One Ventures, Alphabet’s GV, Khosla Ventures, Marc Benioff’s TIME Ventures and former YouTube chief executive Susan Wojcicki, one of the world's first AI recruiters. Her goal is to help recruiting teams find the best, most appropriate candidates for a job opening more efficiently than traditional headhunting. “I'm really passionate about the potential AI has to give people opportunity and agency, and eliminate barriers for underserved talent to accessing quality jobs,” Xu said.

PROMOTED
Her company leverages AI to enable internal corporate talent acquisition teams and outside third-party recruiters to source and screen candidates. After the AI provides several appropriate on-target applicants, human recruiters will pick up the process and usher the candidates through the interview and hiring process. The AI-powered platform offers an advantage in finding and assessing relevant talent quickly and at scale.

From The Past To The Future
For years, the typical recruiting process remained little unchanged. It would start with human resources and a manager needing to find candidates to fill an open position. The company would have its talent acquisition team briefed on what the hiring manager is looking for in an applicant and then start scouring LinkedIn, job boards and tapping into its internal database to find candidates that fit the job description. The firm would also invite third-party recruiters to help with difficult searches to supplement the efforts of the internal corporate recruiters.

Headhunting can be a lengthy and challenging ordeal. It takes a lot of time and energy to search for people who look like they have the right skills and experiences for the role. Recruiters will spend time sifting through hundreds of résumés and sending texts, emails and cold reachouts to find potential candidates for a position. Searching for a mid to senior-level, white-collar professional can take weeks to several months to find an appropriate slate of candidates, interview them, go through the hiring process and ultimately find the right fit.

Instead of doing the drudgery work, by leveraging AI, recruiters are empowered to hone in on potential candidates with all the right qualities, experiences, background, education, skills and appropriate licenses and credentials. Automation saves recruiters time and energy by finding the on-target applicants quickly and easily. According to Xu, customers report finding candidates 2x faster using Moonhub.

Allowing AI to do the behind-the-scenes work frees recruiters to focus on the relationship-driven aspects of the hiring process to ensure the match is suitable for both the candidate and the company.
Xu spoke to the importance of facilitating a seamless candidate experience for the hiring organization, as it directly influences their reputation, employer brand and the ability to attract top talent. “The recruitment process serves as a candidate's initial interaction with a prospective employer, shaping their perception of the company's values and culture. A positive experience characterized by clear communication, efficient processes and tailored and relevant outreach will increase the likelihood of actually hiring talent. On the other hand, a negative experience can deter qualified candidates,” the founder stated.
How The AI Recruiting Process Works
The startup helps companies find and hire talent across many sectors. With conversational AI, a real-time people database and a focus on sourcing and outreach, Moonhub helps find hidden gems that traditional recruiting methods might otherwise miss.
Day One Ventures' founder and general partner Masha Bucher said of Moonhub’s value add for companies that want to hire the highest quality talent quickly, “The AI is a game-changing tool that’ll enhance hiring managers and recruiting leaders’ abilities to do their jobs more effectively. Recruiters tell Moonhub what type of candidate they’re looking for, and in five minutes, the AI will recommend a list of 50-plus targeted candidates, saving them dozens of hours of work.”
It looks beyond the typical attributes to find candidates who are an excellent fit for any job opportunity. The platform leverages AI and data science to identify and source potential candidates from across the internet, searching GitHub, StackOverflow, LinkedIn and other sites.
After identifying candidates, Moonhub screens them through automated assessments to further validate their skills and abilities that match the job description. This helps filter candidates before human review, saving time for recruiters from having to go through hundreds or even thousands of résumés manually.
Human recruiters then manually review the screened candidates to evaluate their experience, portfolios, projects and other qualifications. The process uniquely combines AI screening along with the human judgment of recruiters.
Xu urged that human recruiters not feel threatened by automation but view it as a valuable tool that complements and enhances their capabilities.
She said, “The essential things that recruiters do—persuading and communicating with candidates—that can’t really be replaced. However, most recruiters spend time on tasks that don’t relate to these core competencies.”
AI recruiters excel in handling repetitive and time-consuming tasks, such as résumé screening and initial candidate assessments, allowing human recruiters to focus on more strategic and relationship-driven aspects of the hiring process. AI can swiftly analyze vast amounts of data, identify patterns, source candidates and calibrate back and forth with the recruiter and hiring manager.
Moreover, AI can help eliminate bias in the recruitment process by making decisions based on objective criteria rather than subjective judgment.
“While AI brings efficiency to certain aspects of recruiting, human recruiters remain essential for building personal connections, understanding nuanced candidate qualities and navigating interpersonal dynamics. Ultimately, an AI recruiter will only supercharge human recruiters’ abilities to do their jobs and fill roles more effectively,” Xu stated.

The 2023 Skills Index report from BTG (Business Talent Group) unearthed some striking data about artificial intelligence and its integration in today's workplace. Data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning remain in-demand skills, with data science and machine learning at 100%+ demand compared to previous years. And this is anticipated to be the case for at least the next few years as AI tools continue to roll out following the emergence of chat GPT in the market in November 2022.


However, while demand is at an all-time high, one year on from ChatGPT's launch, approximately 71% of employers are still facing challenges due to lacking the internal expertise on how to effectively use artificial intelligence, and specifically generative AI, as part of their non-technical workflow.

Some of the core challenges highlighted by the report include lack of clarity as to AI regulations, little understanding amongst senior leadership teams, concerns related to data protection and security, being too busy with other important matters, and finally lack of understanding as to where it can be best applied. This poses a significant challenge as relates to AI integration, and means that the World Economic Forum's predictions of generative AI boosting the economy by up to 14.4 trillion may be retarded in progress due to limited knowledge.

PROMOTED
So what can be done to resolve this internal knowledge gap?

Become AI Aware
The very first step to take is for key internal stakeholders and business partners to develop awareness of AI and its capabilities through undertaking training, and how it can improve decision-making, forecasting, analysis, and everyday workflows. With this knowledge, leaders can be empowered to make the right choices for their organizations.

Work With Consultants
Another simple solution would be for employers to call in external AI consultants who are verified subject matter experts within this domain, and whose expertise relates specifically to AI ethics and regulations, and data protection and security. These consultants could work in collaboration with employers to advise them on how to integrate AI into their work without compromising data or trust.

AI Change Management And Focus Groups
Another longer term approach which might be more suitable for some employers would be too hire someone to oversee AI change management, or to have an AI focus group. Although the concept is relatively new, this type of change management may prove to be highly effective in rolling out artificial intelligence usage, department by department, until everyone is using AI tools to boost their productivity.

You might want to consider running pilot projects to test user experience and acceptance before rolling out across the entire company, and collate this feedback to assess what tools are best for you and your organisation's objectives. Once you have done this, you can work on scaling gradually and gathering feedback for each user group.
Training At All Levels
Another important step would be to provide extensive training to employees at all levels, from senior leadership down to middle managers and entry level, on how to deploy AI, and to establish ethical guidelines on what its capabilities are. This will help to remove any misconceptions or worries surrounding using this technology.
Adopting and integrating AI should be a top priority for employers. If it's not yours right now, it will be when your competitors gain the upper hand and steal your talent and your customers. Through persistence, experimentation, and training, generative AI can be the new normal of work life, freeing up employees to more creative endeavors and enabling improved mental health and wellbeing through reduced work.
Who knows, this might result in the long-awaited four day work week?

KEY TAKEAWAYS
We speak to research groups about how employers and employees expect to use generative AI — and the importance of leveraging the technology across a global workforce.




Since the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI, artificial intelligence (AI) is now firmly entrenched in the business world.
Employers and employees are enthusiastic about its potential but are still getting to grips with how AI — particularly generative AI — will benefit them the most.
Data collated by labor market analytics firm Lightcast shows that the number of job listings related to generative AI took off in the first half of 2023. This reflects the shift in generative AI from a concept in testing to a tool that is commonly used, not only by technical experts.
via LightCast
Who will benefit most is unclear, as employers and employees point to each other as the most likely beneficiary, with 58% of global executives believing that employees will benefit more, whereas 53% of global employees believe that executives will benefit most.
While 84% of employees are hesitant about using AI, 93% say they are excited about the potential uses of AI at work (PDF), according to a study by human resources solutions provider Globalization Partners (G-P).
Gangadhar Konduri, G-P’s Senior Vice President and Head of Product and Design, told Techopedia:Advertisements




“If you put all these Lego pieces of the puzzle together — employees and employers both think that it is very important and AI is going to really help them, most of the executives think global organizations are going to help adopt these kinds of new technologies better, and then with respect to the scarcity of the talent they need to go global.
“The right recipe for success is to adopt the technology in a thoughtful way and to grow globally in order to make that adoption go faster.”
Almost half of executives, 48%, report that global organizations are better at adopting and implementing the latest technology and tools.
Both executives and employees are aligned on using AI to review and summarize information and tailor documents to different languages and cultures.
Employees are more enthusiastic about using AI tools to automate repetitive tasks, while executives prefer using AI to track data to quantify the impact of their work.
There are reasons for executives and employees alike to be enthusiastic about using AI. Nearly half of all executives (48%) and 45% of employees believe that AI will significantly improve not just automation but also the ability to predict and address business challenges.
There are three key ways in which employers can harness employee enthusiasm to leverage the benefits of AI, Konduri said:

Align company and employee visions on automation to help employees free up their time to focus on value-added work.
Provide training and expansion opportunities so that new technologies can be adopted seamlessly.
Pair up employees with a global counterpart, whether a manager or a peer, to help them grow.

The Impact of AI on Approaches to Skills Development
As AI systems take on the most repetitive, replicable tasks, there will likely be a stronger focus on human skills such as collaboration, communication, and critical thinking, according to Lightcast.
“As AI takes on more rote tasks like coding and programming, as well as even basic writing tasks, workers will need to take on more stakeholder management and idea generation,” Lightcast states.
Analysis by Lightcast and the OECD shows that while all employers using AI consistently demand human or baseline skills, the companies that posted the most AI jobs indicated a higher need for workers who combine their technical skills with leadership, innovation, and problem-solving.
G-P’s Konduri tole Techopedia:
“Skill development needs to be bi-directional and global.
 
“It’s important for employers to set up the right opportunities for employees to develop those skills — and it is not just developing skills, but developing and using them and getting some value.
 
“So the employers need to provide those opportunities and the employees need to look for those opportunities.”
Lightcast found that skill requirements are changing rapidly: on average, 37% of the top 20 skills in a job changed in just five years — a dynamic that generative AI will exacerbate.
“Reskilling is even more important than before – and employers should rethink both the skills they train on and how they train. Assessing skills gaps or training needs can no longer be a one-and-done exercise by employers and training providers,” Lightcast said.
Employers should allocate internal resources to increase mentoring, shadowing, and apprenticeships rather than waiting for content to be developed to show employees how they can best use AI. This can help employers fill skills gaps without wasting money on resources that are not agile enough to change with their needs.
‘Digital When You Want It but Human When You Need It’
The thoughtful implementation of skills-based hiring will become more critical as traditional methods of initially screening applicants, such as cover letters, will become less helpful to employers. Work sample tests, short job-related case studies, or other project-based hiring tools are likely to become more popular and tend to be less biased, according to Lightcast.
AI is taking on a transformational role in recruitment, particularly when hiring global talent.
“It is fundamentally important as you consider entering a new geographic location,” Konduri said. “And it is not just hiring: it is about compliance and ongoing nurturing and management of talent, and AI will help companies stay on the forefront of these emerging trends.”
To avoid the risk of bias or unintended consequences in the use of AI systems, “a good governance model, a good automated feedback loop model, and good automated testing for that is absolutely required, and it needs to be paired with humans,” Konduri said.
“We use a phrase: ‘Digital when you want it but human when you need it’ — we need to have that human element to make sure that you’re not only getting to the results that you want, but you are also getting there thoughtfully and with no unintended side effects.
“You want to make sure there are no ‘hallucinations’.”
Replacing Tasks, Not Jobs
Concerns about technology and automation eliminating jobs are not new, Lightcast notes. But, the ways in which AI can and will change jobs are not entirely negative.
Even if large language models (LMMs), which power generative AI tools like ChatGPT, take on writing marketing copy, for example, there still needs to be a human identifying topics and prompting the tool.
Marketing specialists may then need training in prompt engineering.
The top titles for job listings referring to generative AI in the 12 months to September 2023 included data scientists, machine learning engineers, curriculum writers, software engineers, and research scientists.
via Lightcast
“‘Is AI going to replace the workforce?’ is not the complete question,” Konduri said. “Even provocatively, you can answer it as ‘yes, AI is going to replace part of the workforce’.
“Because the real question is not is AI going to replace the workforce — the real question is ‘is AI going to replace the repetitive parts of the workforce so that we can unshackle and unblock the potential of the workforce and humans?’
“That is the principle that is important to reinforce.”
The Bottom Line
Generative AI is transforming the role of employers and employees and will require a new approach to skills development as automation shifts the emphasis to uniquely human abilities.
AI can be a valuable tool in global recruitment, compliance, and employee management, but it must be moderated by human involvement to ensure it is used appropriately without unintended consequences.

AI impact on society



The 2023 word of the year: artificial intelligence. And it’s pushing the boundaries of technology capabilities and human intelligence.
As we venture further into the growth phase of artificial intelligence (AI), the landscape is filled with unparalleled innovations that promise to redefine our way of life.
Such promises come with boundless opportunities and intricate challenges that beg for deep reflection and careful navigation. Understanding these facets becomes indispensable for businesses, innovators, and even the everyday citizen at this pivotal juncture.
So today, let’s dive into the future of artificial intelligence. We’ll uncover the opportunities that await, the hurdles we must overcome, and the profound impact AI will cast upon our society as we know it.
The Future of Artificial Intelligence (AI): Opportunities
Revolutionizing the Startup World With Automation and Personalization
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a transformative force, revolutionizing how enterprises operate their business.
Deloitte surveyed 2,620 global leaders, and 94% of respondents agree that AI is critical to their success.
Why? This cutting-edge technology offers tools and solutions that empower companies with valuable insights, streamlined processes, and enhanced customer experiences.
So, when starting a new business and trying to keep up with the big dogs, keeping a pulse on AI technology is a surefire way to keep yourself in the running and establish yourself a solid foundation for future success.
One way that AI helps entrepreneurs kickstart their online ventures is through market research and data analysis. AI-powered algorithms can swiftly gather and analyze vast amounts of data, providing valuable insights into:

Competitive landscapes
Customer preferences
Market trends

With this knowledge, entrepreneurs can make informed decisions, identify untapped opportunities, and tailor their business strategies to meet specific market demands.
And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. AI’s automation capabilities are pivotal in streamlining various business processes.
You know the drill: work smarter, not harder. For example, with AI text generators, business owners can spend less time on repetitive tasks like writing thousands of product descriptions and more time on growth initiatives.
AI-powered chatbots can handle customer inquiries and provide instant support 24/7. This round-the-clock assistance fosters customer satisfaction and engagement, even during non-business hours, ultimately driving sales and brand loyalty. Plus, it takes some of the burden off your customer support team.
And then there’s personalization. Recent studies show that 80% of shoppers are more likely to purchase from a brand that goes above and beyond to provide personalized experiences.
AI is the perfect tool for recommending relevant products and delivering personalized marketing by analyzing customer behavior and preferences. It’s a no-brainer to let the tools do the heavy lifting, creating a more tailored and appealing experience consumers crave.
This level of personalization increases customer engagement and conversion rates, translating into higher revenues and sustainable growth. What’s not to love?
The Rise of Smart Cities: Urban Planning and Infrastructure
A report from The Insight Partners predicts the global smart city industry will reach a valuation of $3,110 billion by 2028, expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19%.
What’s behind this astronomical growth? Integrating technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence, and big data analytics into urban settings.
The perks of smart city solutions pave the way for advanced urban design, heightened energy conservation, and superior public services.
Both governmental bodies and corporate sectors are pouring funds into these innovations, catering to the escalating demands for greener and more effective city infrastructure.
Take, for example, Chattanooga, TN. They’ve joined forces with Seoul Robotics to roll out a lidar-infused traffic control system. This platform feeds the city real-time information on traffic dynamics and bottlenecks.
This tech allows this southern Tennesee city to:

Provide swift responses from emergency teams in the case of accidents.
Leverage precise data for refining traffic strategies.

But the shift by Chattanooga reflects a larger global transformation. Cities (small and large) are harnessing intelligent tech to upgrade their civic amenities and infrastructure.
The future of urban areas? Omnipresent sensors — from lidar to atmospheric monitors — work around the clock to improve the lives of its citizens.
The smart city sector is on the brink of a significant surge, a change steered by the embrace of advanced technologies and a universal push for improvements in a sleepy industry. Digital transformation is here to stay.
Unleashing the Potential of Data Analytics and Big Data
Thanks to smartphones, IoT, and computers, we’ve been sitting on a surge of big data before defining the term.
Sadly, the vastness of this information is too complex and outgrows human analysis. The solution? The rise of AI algorithms.
Enter the dynamic duo: AI and big data. Together, they’re shaping future trends in sectors from business to entertainment. AI thrives on this data, deepening its understanding of consumer behaviors through online activities and social interactions. Yet, its effectiveness is tied to the quality of data it consumes.
For example, an employee cost calculator powered by AI can only accurately assess the total cost of employment (for hiring new headcount from across the globe) if the data used to train the model is vetted and accurate. As the saying goes, garbage in, garbage out.
But Forbes underscores a fascinating point: combining AI with big data could automate almost 80% of the physical work and substantial parts of data processing and collection. This fusion isn’t just streamlining supply chains but reshaping businesses as they pivot strategies based on real-time insights.
With AI growing more autonomous and powerful, our future hinges on harmonizing it with our human touch. And upskilling is necessary to prime the next wave of experts for this exciting frontier.
Boosting Creativity: AI in Music, Video, and Design
Artistry and design stem from passion, human intuition, and emotion. Yet, the emergence of AI presents a wide range of new avenues for creativity and innovation.
Predictive algorithms can forecast fashion trends. AI-driven design software can optimize architectural layouts for efficiency and aesthetics.
In graphic design, AI-powered tools can auto-adjust layouts, recommend color schemes, or generate brand logos. The result? A design process that’s more efficient than ever. And you’ll never face a design rut again.
On the music front, Paul McCartney told BBC Radio that he’s planning to use artificial intelligence to create the final Beatles song (which’d include vocals from the late John Lennon)—pure magic.
Venturing into video production, AI can now auto-curate content, guaranteeing that only the most engaging clips make the final cut. It can also optimize video sequences for color grading, stabilization, and audio synchronization with voice-over services.
TL; DR. AI marries the raw, emotive essence of human creativity with the precision and efficiency of machine learning, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in music, video, and design.
The Future of Artificial Intelligence (AI): Challenges
Overcoming Data Privacy and Cybersecurity Concerns
AI requires an enormous amount of data to function correctly — but how do we ensure that the data collected is safe from hackers and other bad actors?
​​The astonishing number of records exposed in 2022, each breach averaging $4.35 million, underscores the vulnerability of our contemporary data systems. Apart from their immediate financial implications, these breaches erode public trust and emphasize the urgent need for more robust data protection measures.
As AI systems become more intertwined with daily life, organizations must invest heavily in advanced encryption techniques, multi-factor authentication, and blockchain technology.
Machine learning is advancing to help predict and detect breaches. This scenario creates an AI versus AI interstellar — where intelligent algorithms work tirelessly to counteract the malicious intents of rogue AIs or hackers. Genius or totally crazy?
53% of global leaders agree that cybersecurity is one of the main threats to the mass adaptation of artificial intelligence. However, only 38% confirmed they implemented practices to safeguard their data.
Is there enough time to recoup this gap?
Navigating the Regulatory Landscape of AI Technologies
As AI rockets us into the future, ‌government regulations must play catch-up.
And Elon Musk (of all people) is spearheading this movement. He says, “There is a real danger for digital superintelligence having negative consequences,” and he’s “in favor of AI regulation.”
The problem? Developers are racing to produce increasingly powerful digital intellects. According to a letter by 1,000 tech leaders, they are so complex that even their creators can’t comprehend, anticipate, or consistently regulate them. It sounds like a scene from one of those Sci-fi movies.
It’s clear that we need clear guidelines and policies for using AI ethically and safely. But what will that look like? And who’s responsible? Hopefully, we’ll figure it out before it’s too late.
The Future of Artificial Intelligence (AI): Impact on Society
Enhancing Accessibility: How AI Empowers Individuals with Disabilities
There’s more to AI than self-driving cars. AI has emerged as a glimmer of hope for individuals with disabilities.
One such significant stride was the development of text-to-speech software. This kind of software, often touted as the best among AI applications, does much more than just transform written content into spoken words. Its impact on society and the potential for future growth is miraculous.
Picture a world where the visually impaired can experience books like those with sight do. Where language barriers dissolve, and educational content is accessible to all.
These are the possibilities brought to life by artificial intelligence. And it’s quickly becoming a staple tool for communication, education, and entertainment (on top of helping people with disabilities).
With AI, barriers are gradually diminishing, ushering in an era of increased inclusivity around every corner.
AI’s push for inclusivity in the workplace is reshaping HR management strategies. Modern HR teams harness AI tools, from accessibility software to real-time translations, to foster more inclusive environments.
In turn, these tools enrich company culture and expand talent pools, capturing a wealth of diverse skills and perspectives. That’s a huge win.
Educational Evolution: The Intersection of AI and Lifelong Learning
While AI gives quick answers, it doesn’t always prioritize effective methods that foster a genuine learning experience.
So, are our future generations at risk of losing out on a traditional education? Alarmingly, AI can deliver flawed content in‌ convincing ways, like by providing incorrect math solutions. And students take it at face value.
With that comes anxiety among students about their future. What will their jobs look like? Are they falling behind if they’re not keeping up with AI trends? It’s a melting pot of concerns.
But all experts agree: the evolving role of AI in education requires immediate attention to ensure its positive and ethical influence on the future of our society.
According to the Office of Educational Technology, they envision a technology-enhanced future in education that is “more like an electric bike and less like robot vacuums.”
The students are aware and fully in control, but their workload is less, and their effort is multiplied by technological advancements. But only time will tell how this plays out.
Finding the Perfect Balance Between AI and Human Intervention
AI’s potential is undeniable. But so is the unique value of human intuition and emotion. Striking the right balance will be essential for long-term adoption.
Automated systems may handle data crunching, but humans provide context, empathy, and judgment. The key? AI complements, rather than replaces, human capabilities.
Because when it comes to decisions, especially important ones like health, we still need that human touch.
Imagine using AI to help patients achieve their weight loss goals. AI tools can look at a patient’s health history, diet, genes, and activity to suggest the best treatment plan.
But here’s where doctors will continue to play a crucial role. When prescribing weight loss medication, they consider things the AI might miss, like a patient’s feelings or recent research.
A doctor can talk to the patient about how the medicine might make them feel, the benefits, and any risks. This human dialogue is important because it ensures the patient is entirely on board with (and understands) the treatment plan.
While AI offers precise, data-informed suggestions, the human touch grounds these decisions. Embracing AI’s speed and the depth of human understanding will be instrumental in shaping a future where technology enhances, not replaces, our inherent human strengths.
Wrapping Up
The future of artificial intelligence technology holds great promise for improving our lives, driving innovation, and solving complex business problems.
It’s an exciting time to be at the forefront of AI research and development as we shape a future where machines and humans work hand in hand to create a better world.

Marsh McLennan Develops New Generative AI Tool






November 21, 2023 10:56 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Marsh McLennan [NYSE:MMC] and its business Oliver Wyman, a global leader in management consulting, announced today the launch of a new Generative AI tool for colleagues. The tool, called LenAI, was developed by Marsh McLennan’s Dublin Innovation Center in collaboration with Oliver Wyman Digital and is available to Marsh McLennan’s more than 85,000 colleagues worldwide.


“We know AI has the potential to help our clients increase their productivity, transform complex and expensive processes, and do other things that were out of practical reach until now”Post this

“We have some of the brightest minds in business working across our four businesses and a collaborative culture,” said Paul Beswick, Senior Vice President and Global Chief Information Officer, Marsh McLennan. “When it came time to introduce the tool, we were able to deploy it quickly and securely. Since its full launch recently, LenAI has been a game changer for our teams, enabling them to work smarter for the benefit of our clients.”


“We know AI has the potential to help our clients increase their productivity, transform complex and expensive processes, and do other things that were out of practical reach until now,” added Vivek Sen, Partner, Head of Digital, Oliver Wyman, Americas. “We’ve always been at the forefront of helping our clients leverage the latest technologies even within highly regulated industries, and AI is no different.”


Key features of the tool include:



Built on technologies from Microsoft and OpenAI – Marsh McLennan and Oliver Wyman were able to work directly with Microsoft to deploy a private internally-hosted version of OpenAI’s foundational models, which keeps all the data in-house.




Designed with regulatory requirements in mind – The tool was developed in close partnership with Marsh McLennan’s privacy, compliance, risk management, information security, and legal teams to ensure it meets Marsh McLennan’s strict standards for data security and to address and mitigate the risks associated with this new technology, including the following:


Minimal data retention



Required training for users on appropriate usage and the risks posed by the use of AI



Managing what data the tool is allowed to access, in alignment with legal considerations



Assessing the tool against the growing body of frameworks and regulations that apply to the use of Generative AI






A growing range of capabilities – LenAI extends the capabilities of the underlying AI models by adding tools that provide more accurate and valuable outputs. These tools include the ability to search the internet, work on a wide range of documents, perform accurate calculations, access information from high quality publications, and more.




Enhanced productivity – These features allow colleagues to be more productive and have greater impact in their client work. Early adopters at Oliver Wyman self-reported saving an average of eight hours per week when using the tool. Additionally, they reported spending 20% less time on simple, repetitive tasks and reallocating that time toward more complex tasks.



LenAI is a just one example of how Marsh McLennan and Oliver Wyman are harnessing the immense power of AI to empower both colleagues and clients. With an extensive network of AI collaborators, Oliver Wyman has spearheaded numerous AI engagements, delivering exceptional value to clients across a wide range of industries. These engagements cover a wide spectrum of applications, ranging from leveraging AI to boost productivity and efficiency, to navigating the intricacies and risks associated with deploying AI solutions safely.


Moreover, Oliver Wyman has helped clients be at the forefront of enhancing the customer experience through cutting-edge AI technologies, while also providing invaluable support for partnership and acquisition decisions in this rapidly evolving field. Notably, Oliver Wyman has developed bespoke tools, including project management platforms, customer personalization engines, and social listening analytics suites, all designed and deployed to meet the highest enterprise safety standards. By embracing responsible AI practices, Oliver Wyman continues to drive innovation and deliver transformative results for its clients.


Marsh McLennan’s four businesses are working closely with clients on a myriad of challenges related to AI’s adoption. Its Marsh business is helping clients identify, mitigate, and transfer the risks of generative AI, while Mercer is consulting with clients on how to navigate the impact of generative AI in the world of work. Guy Carpenter works with insurers to help communities and businesses enjoy the benefits of AI while also managing the growing pains associated with these technologies.

What Is Deep Learning?
Deep Learning is a branch of machine learning dealing with artificial neural networks that are inspired by the structure and function of the brain. It is a sort of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) that mimics how people acquire knowledge. Data science encompasses both statistics and predictive modeling, as well as deep learning. A  deep learning engineer is especially well served by deep learning since it speeds up and simplifies the process of gathering, analyzing, and interpreting massive amounts of data. In its simplest form, deep learning can be viewed as a method of automated predictive analytics. Unlike conventional machine learning algorithms, deep learning algorithms are layered with increasing complexity and abstraction.
Deep-learning computers evaluate data in a logical structure similar to how humans derive conclusions. It should be noted that this can occur through both supervised and unsupervised learning. Deep learning applications do this by employing a layered structure of algorithms known as an artificial neural network (ANN). The architecture of such an ANN is inspired by the biological neural network of the human brain, resulting in a learning process that is significantly superior to that of ordinary machine learning models.
Who Is a Deep Learning Engineer?
A deep learning engineer's duty is to be an expert in the design and implementation of learning algorithms based on deep and complicated neural network topologies. Because the techniques utilized are more sophisticated theoretically, this is more technical work than that of a ""traditional"" machine learning engineer. In agriculture, for example, deep learning enables machines to recognize plants and apply the appropriate treatment, lowering pesticide usage and increasing output. Visual recognition is at the heart of the system. Convolutional neural networks (mostly geared to image recognition) and recurrent neural networks are examples of deep learning (efficient for time series problems).
Deep Learning algorithms must be used by a deep learning engineer to create and improve perception algorithms for autonomous cars. You will be responsible for the whole Deep Learning development life cycle, including data gathering, feature engineering, model training, and testing. One will be able to develop a cutting-edge Deep Learning algorithm and apply it to real-world end-to-end production.
What Does a Deep Learning Engineer Do?
An Artificial Intelligence project's concept and development include several life stages. Initially, a deep learning engineer is involved in the project's data engineering and modeling phase. He is also an important element of the project's deployment and infrastructure. Deep learning engineers do data engineering duties such as creating project data needs, and gathering, categorizing, examining, and cleaning data. They are also involved in modeling activities such as training deep learning models, developing evaluation measures, and searching for model hyperparameters. A deep learning engineer's work includes deployment duties such as turning prototyped code into production code and setting up a cloud infrastructure to deploy the production model.

Deep Learning Engineer vs. Machine Learning Engineer
It takes a lot of work to decide between becoming a deep learning engineer or a machine learning engineer. 
Both careers are in high demand and will be for many years.
But before you make your decision, consider these fundamental differences between these two roles:
Deep Learning Engineers are more concerned with a system's architecture than its function. Machine Learning Engineers tend to be more concerned with the process of a system than its architecture.
Deep Learning Engineers use deep neural networks and other techniques like reinforcement learning to train systems to learn particular tasks and perform them automatically. Machine Learning Engineers are more focused on building algorithms that can learn from data without being explicitly programmed by humans. Still, they don't necessarily use deep neural networks or reinforcement learning techniques as often as Deep Learning Engineers do.
Deep Learning Engineers tend to work closely with software developers, who write code for their systems' functionality and use deep neural networks as components within those programs (for example, using convolutional layers for image recognition). Machine Learning Engineers work closely with data scientists who use large amounts of data as inputs into their algorithms (for example, using logistic regression.
How to Become a Deep Learning Engineer?
You cannot become an experienced deep learning engineer overnight. You must begin your journey as a data scientist or ML engineer in order to garb this position. Mathematics, Statistics, Probability, and, of course, programming are the foundations for all of these employment categories. To flourish in your deep learning job, you must be well-versed in Machine Learning ideas, including both supervised and unsupervised learning approaches. The online courses will be of great use to you. It is critical to becoming acquainted with and hands-on with various ML/DL libraries and frameworks for model construction. Furthermore, because the majority of popular libraries and frameworks are Python-based, you must be fluent in the Python programming language.
Once you've mastered the fundamentals, you may begin using theoretical knowledge and working on tiny ML/DL projects. Kaggle is a great tool for finding interesting and hard topics. Work on ML models such as logistic regression, K-means clustering, support vector machines, and other sophisticated methods. Begin learning the other parts at the same time, like programming, data mining, predictive analysis, ML libraries/frameworks, and so on.
Skills Required for Becoming a Deep Learning Engineer
Deep learning engineers are responsible for developing and maintaining machine learning models. They typically work with a team of data scientists, software engineers, and other specialists to create new AI-powered systems that can perform tasks like image recognition or natural language processing.
Software Engineering
Algorithms (including knowing how to create algorithms that can sort, optimize, and search) are some of the most critical computer science principles for Deep Learning Engineers to comprehend, as are data structures and computer architecture. Because a DL Engineer's typical output is software, they should be familiar with software engineering best practices, particularly those concerning system design, version control, testing, and requirements analysis.
Data Skills
Many of the same skills as a Data Scientist are needed of a DL Engineer, such as data modeling, technical ability with programming languages such as Python and Java, and knowing how to assess prediction algorithms and models. A grasp of probability and statistics would also be beneficial.
Frontend/UI Technology
When you have your Machine Learning solution ready, you must offer it to others in the form of charts or visualizations, because the person to whom you are discussing may not be familiar with these methods and would prefer a functional solution to his problem. So knowing any UI technology like Django, Flask, and if necessary, JavaScript can help with this development process. Your Machine Learning code will be the backend, while you will design a frontend for it.
Cloud Technology
As technology advances, the quantity of data that can be managed on a local server grows exponentially, necessitating the use of cloud technologies. These systems provide excellent services ranging from data preparation to model creation.
Soft Skills
Despite the fact that machine learning is a technical job title, soft skills are nevertheless vital. Even if you are an expert in machine learning, you will still need to be skilled in communication, time management, and teamwork. A DL Engineer must also be devoted to lifelong learning. Because the disciplines of artificial intelligence, deep learning, machine learning, and data science are developing so quickly, any professional who wants to stay on the cutting edge must pursue continuous education.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office on Tuesday announced a new report outlining the potential benefits that generative AI could bring to state government — from improving accessibility of the state’s services to bolstering cybersecurity — along with an extensive description of the risks the technology could bring along for the ride.
The report is the first major product of an executive order Newsom issued in September that directed an expansive effort to explore how the emerging technology could be used inside the state government and to capture the economic benefit of a new technology that’s largely developed by California software companies. The 34-page document includes descriptions and examples of six potential ways California could use generative AI, but the bulk of the report is dedicated to exploring the many risks the technology presents — to privacy, security, the state’s workforce, operations, transparency, safety and government accountability.
The report cites ways that generative AI could amplify existing threats and create new ones. Among the manifold new risks outlined in the report are threats as alarming as generative AI’s potential ability to enable “bad actors to design, synthesize, or acquire dangerous chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) weapons.”
Other threats listed include generative AI’s capacity to support mis- and disinformation campaigns, generate offensive material and to create “deepfakes,” materials that synthesize the likeness, speech or writing of individuals. Authors also pointed out that generative AI can “lower technical barriers” that once kept bad actors from effectively launching campaigns on social media to harm the public’s mental health or polarize politically.

Officials also cited concern with the intractable challenge of identifying how generative AI models reach their conclusions. Sourcing information, the report says, is expected to be a perennial challenge. 
Generative AI could also create new risks for California’s cybersecurity efforts, authors wrote. The report notes a handful of examples, including the potential for generative AI to be used to remotely execute harmful code, to modify access permissions, steal or delete data or to create content that emulates officials to aid in cyberattacks.
Generative AI ‘pioneers’
Risks notwithstanding, the report’s authors, a task force created by Newsom’s order that includes statewide Chief Information Officer Liana Bailey-Crimmins, strike a sanguine tone in the state’s press materials.
Bailey-Crimmins, who told StateScoop in an interview last month that the ultimate timeline for this work is on the order of years, not months, said in a press release accompanying the announcement that the state is excited to be “at the forefront” of government’s work in generative AI.

“With streamlined services and the ability to predict needs, the deployment of GenAI can make it easier for people to access government services they rely on, saving them time and money,” she said.
And Amy Tong, California’s government operations secretary, is quoted in the materials as saying that the state has an opportunity to “pioneer” new use cases.
“Through careful use and well-designed trials, we will learn how to deploy this technology effectively to make the work of government employees easier and improve services we provide to the people of California,” Tong said.
The report describes six major use cases that California state agencies stand to benefit from generative AI, including summarizing and classifying unwieldy collections of data, such as meeting notes and public outreach documentation; catering materials to the needs of California’s diverse population, such as by identifying demographic groups who currently struggle to access state services; and expanding the state’s use of foreign languages, such as by converting English educational materials into additional languages and formats, such as audiobooks, large print text and Braille documents.
The report names optimizing and converting old computer code into modern languages, or otherwise using it to streamline and “democratize” software development; finding insights that “empower and support” decision-makers, such as by spotting cybersecurity threats earlier; and optimizing the state’s operations in support of environmental considerations, such as by analyzing “traffic patterns, ride requests, and vehicle telemetry data to optimize routing and scheduling for state-managed transportation fleets like buses, waste collection trucks.”

Next steps
With the first step of Newsom’s generative AI order complete, officials are now tasked with developing new training materials for state employees, establishing new partnerships with regional institutions and designing new tools for testing generative AI products before they can be widely deployed. The order also requires an ongoing analysis of how AI is affecting the state.
The order requires the AI task force to develop a “procurement blueprint” that explicates how California can purchase such new software from private companies, while ensuring support of a “safe, ethical, and responsible innovation ecosystem inside state government.” This document is to be created with consideration of the federal government’s AI Bill of Rights and the National Institute for Science and Technology’s AI Risk Management Framework.
The state also plans to create formal partnerships with the University of California, Berkeley and Stanford University to better understand generative AI’s effects. The state plans next year to host a summit to discuss how generative AI is affecting the state and its workforce.

Like it or not, artificial intelligence has established itself as a fixture of the 21st century workplace. The state of California – home to many of the world’s top AI companies – is no exception. A new report from the Government Operations Agency examines the potential benefits and risks of the state using generative AI – a powerful tool that can create original content based on large inputs of data – in its daily operations. The report comes in response to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s September executive order that instructed state agencies to brainstorm and develop a plan for how to “ethically and responsibly” deploy AI technology in government operations.The report does not specifically address how or whether the introduction of generative AI would displace state employees in certain classifications. State employees are expected to follow common-sense safety and privacy practices, such as paraphrasing AI-generated content rather than using it verbatim and never sharing Californians’ resident data to free, publicly available tools such as ChatGPT or Google Bard. The report suggests that state departments could use generative AI tools in these beneficial ways:▪ Summarizing meetings▪ Analyzing public feedback surveys▪ Monitoring the status of public infrastructure, such as roads and bridges▪ Translating public documents into different languages▪ Generating promotional materials, such as fliers and social media postsHowever, the report also pointed out the numerous risks associated with using these tools for daily operations. Chief among those concerns was the reliability of the models and algorithms that power the AI tools. Erroneous information created by government AI tools could lead to the spread of harmful misinformation and disinformation, and as a result, Californians’ safety could be jeopardized.Fairness was also a concern, as unconscious biases like race and gender could infect the AI model and unfairly deem applicants ineligible for certain government programs. “This could reasonably erode Californians’ trust in their government and its services,” the report reads. “GenAI should center on the needs of the human workforce, support the carrying out of responsibilities to Californians, and avoid contributing to additional bureaucracy, process, or safety risks.”Want state worker news in your inbox?

HR TechnologyElevating HR with generative AI: A transformative journeyAI holds the potential to streamline operations, improve candidate interactions, and transform how employees engage with their work and the organisation. 







 

Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become the buzzword in the world of technology for almost a year ever since Open AI, a US-based AI research and deployment company introduced Chat GPT, an AI tool for testing to the public. However, the technology behind it is not new, as the history and evolution of generative AI dates back to the late 1950s when researchers were focused on rule-based systems which could simulate human thinking. The 1990s saw an exponential shift in generative AI with the introduction of neural networks.

The last decade saw significant strides in generative AI, leveraging new ML algorithms to create varied content like text, sounds, images, and 3D models. Neural networks discern patterns in existing data, fueling potential for industry transformation, heightened productivity, and improved customer experiences.Also Read:
The evolving role of HR in the AI era

Although HR trailed in AI adoption, generative AI's ability to swiftly produce hyper-personalised content across an employee's journey stands to revolutionise talent decisions and amplify business impact. Here are specific applications across the employee lifecycle that harness data for impactful talent decisions.
Anticipating the talent
The success of any strategic workforce planning depends on accurate demand forecasting. However, forecasting demand is not limited to predicting the right numbers but also identifying the right skill/competency mix to ensure that it generates the results that are expected. There are AI-enabled tools that help sift through past data, analyse trends, and predict future needs based on past demand. However, generative AI facilitates continuous learning, adapting to changing market dynamics, customer preferences, and organisational limitations. These learnings are incorporated to ensure a proactive approach to workforce planning and development. 
Attracting the talent
Generative AI, a subset of deep learning, streamlines resume processing on ATS/job portals. By quickly parsing and scoring skills, it expedites candidate stack ranking, reducing recruiter effort. Moreover, it aids in identifying high-performing employees by creating customised skill match scores.
For prospective candidates, generative AI tools enhance the application experience, providing prompt application status, fitment scores, personalised feedback, and recommending suitable open positions. In screening calls, chatbots conduct personalised discussions with multiple candidates simultaneously, processing responses instantly to qualify candidates efficiently.
Generative AI extends support to interview panels with structured questionnaires, aiding in shortlisting the most suitable candidates. Post-selection, addressing the notice period challenge, a pre-onboarding engagement using voice bots ensures effective communication and engagement, handling various tasks from documentation to queries on policies and benefits. This technology offers a seamless transition from offer acceptance to the first day on the job.
Developing the talent
Performance management as a concept has evolved from just an achievement of goals to a measurement of the impact that it has created on the business. Hence the success of any developmental strategy would be to develop the potential of the employee which can directly relate to actions/output which will help achieve the business goals. The success of any type of performance management would depend on using generative AI tools/systems which will help in building their potential by way of identifying the competency gaps and creating a hyper-personalised learning solution which can be converted to a performance solution by way of integrating with the business strategy and dovetail into their individual development plan (IDP). 
Deploying the talent
Generative AI helps in analysing the project requirements and matching it with resource availability by evaluating the skill sets of the employees based on their qualifications, training, and applied experience. By a personalised evaluation of a member’s skills/competencies, they can align each employee to the appropriate projects. Generative AI-based tools can also help in resource allocation by considering workload, resource gaps, availability of resources and project timelines thereby reducing project risks, enhancing operational efficiency, and increasing productivity.
Engaging the talent
Engagement surveys are mostly a reactive strategy to effect changes in an organisation. Generative AI tools can help deal with this problem by using sentiment analysis by analysing employee interactions in different modes (e.g., emails, and chats). These tools can generate new text samples with sentiment characteristics like the training data. This is a major shift from the past where they classified texts rather than create new ones. These tools can help in monitoring employees’ behavioural patterns and engagement levels through data-backed insights in real time. This will help in identifying the red flags and proactively take remedial measures to create a conducive environment for engaging them.
Summing it up
The implementation of generative AI has the potential to revolutionise various segments of the HR function. However, we should also be cognizant of the potential risks that can accompany them with the likes of data bias, data security, privacy concerns, lack of monitoring & auditing, lack of a compliance & regulatory framework, and most importantly dealing with ethical issues. Organisations should create their own guidelines on the responsible and ethical use of generative AI till the time there are proper regulatory frameworks in place. 
The goal of AI is to create computers that can behave like humans and complete jobs faster than humans can do. As Stephen Hawking sums it up beautifully “We must develop as quickly as possible technologies that make possible a direct connection between brain and computer, so that artificial brains contribute to human intelligence rather than opposing it”. Generative AI will help us in achieving this goal and it is in our best interest as a function to adopt it at the earliest.
