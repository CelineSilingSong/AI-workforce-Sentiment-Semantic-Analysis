AI “Sputnik moment” (say it in Chinese*) is at hand
China is overtaking the US not just in the sheer volume of AI research papers submitted and published, but also in the production of high-impact papers as measured by the top 50%, top 10%, and top 1% most-cited papers. “By projecting current trends, we see that China is likely to have more top-10% papers by 2020 and more top-1% papers by 2025” (Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence).

AI continues to be popular among business executives, regardless of complications, concerns and confusion
73% of senior executives see AI/machine learning and automation as areas they want to maintain or increase investment in but only 33% state that they plan to invest more in getting better visibility of their processes, not taking into account that understanding their current processes first could help them work out which technologies would be most beneficial to their business (Celonis).
71% of U.S. enterprises plan to leverage more AI/ML tools for security this year but only 49% of IT professionals feel extremely comfortable using these tools, 76% don’t care if their companies leverage them and 56% still aren’t even sure what AI and ML really mean (Webroot).
PROMOTED
82% of IT and business decision makers agree that company-wide strategies to invest in AI-driven technologies would offer significant competitive advantages, only 29% said their companies have those strategies in place (DXC).

66% of security experts said they would rely upon AI, down from the 74% who said they would in 2018. Cisco attributes the decline to their increased confidence that “migrating to the cloud will improve protection efforts, while apparently decreasing reliance on less proven technologies such as artificial intelligence” (Cisco).
83% of IT professionals are confident their organization has everything it needs to defend against advanced AI- and ML-based cyberattacks, yet 36% reported their organization has suffered a damaging cyberattack within the last 12 months despite using AI/ML security tools (Webroot).
Nearly 90% of IT leaders see their use of AI/ML increasing in the future and 41% look for technology that is powered by AI, a top factor in their purchasing decisions. Their top concerns: Data security (47%), implementing AI/ML (40%), driving innovation and implementing new tech (40%) (Adobe).
37% of service leaders are either piloting or using artificial intelligence (AI) bots and virtual customer assistants (VCAs), and 67% of those leaders believe they are high-value tools in the contact center; 68% of service leaders believe AI bots and VCAs will be of significant importance for them and their organizations in the next two years (Gartner2).
The race against the machine is on. Still, some humans trust AI more than their governments. 
56% of Europeans express weariness about a world where machines perform most of the tasks currently done by humans (IE University).
74% of Europeans think that businesses should only be allowed to substitute jobs that are dangerous or unhealthy and 72% think that governments should set limits to the number of jobs businesses can replace with machines (IE University).
61% of internet users worldwide were worried about AI affecting the availability of work, 58% believe governments need to regulate AI to protect jobs, 32% expressed unease about the potential ethical issues associated with AI, and 31% were concerned about lack of transparency in AI-based decision making (BCG).
25% of Europeans are somewhat or totally in favor of letting an artificial intelligence make important decisions about the running of their country; 43% in the Netherlands, 31% in the UK and Germany (IE University).
45% of retail customer service issues/inquiries have been fully automated without affecting CSAT scores; bots have been used to assist agents by collecting upfront information in 25% of issues; agents and bots combined have been able to handle twice the amount of tickets within a given time period (Helpshift).
Inmates at two prisons in Finland are classifying data to train artificial intelligence algorithms for a startup, Vainu, which sees the partnership as a kind of prison reform that teaches valuable skills. But “other experts say it plays into the exploitative economics of prisoners being required to work for very low wages,” according to The Verge.
“AI” is the new “Big Data” and the new “New Economy.” Tech bubbles are defined by poorly-defined terms and the proliferation of billion- and trillion-dollar forecasts leading to investors’ irrational exuberance
MMC Ventures reviewed the activities, focus and funding of 2,830 purported AI startups in the 13 EU countries most active in AI and found that in approximately 40% of the cases there was no evidence of AI being “material to the company’s value proposition” (MMC Ventures).
MMC Ventures: “‘AI’ is a general term that refers to hardware or software that exhibit behaviour which appears intelligent.”**
Worldwide spending on artificial intelligence (AI) systems is forecast to reach $35.8 billion in 2019, an increase of 44% over 2018, and to more than double to $79.2 billion in 2022 (IDC).
“IDC defines cognitive/Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems as a set of technologies that use deep natural language processing and understanding to answer questions and provide recommendations and direction.”
Business value derived from AI reached $1.2 trillion worldwide in 2018 and will grow to $3.9 trillion by 2022 (Gartner).
Gartner: “Artificial intelligence (AI) applies advanced analysis and logic-based techniques, including machine learning, to interpret events, support and automate decisions, and take actions.”
“We are investing $100 billion in just one thing, AI”—Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son (telling CNBC that all the 70 or investments of his Vision Fund—including Uber, DoorDash, WeWork, and Slack--have been focused on AI).
After years in the (mostly Canadian) wilderness followed by (almost) seven years of plenty, Deep Learning is officially recognized as the dominant AI paradigm
“ACM named Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton, and Yann LeCun recipients of the 2018 ACM A.M. Turing Award for conceptual and engineering breakthroughs that have made deep neural networks a critical component of computing…  their ideas recently resulted in major technological advances, and their methodology is now the dominant paradigm in the field”—Fathers of the Deep Learning Revolution Receive ACM Turing Award
""For a long time, people thought what the three of us were doing was nonsense. They thought we were very misguided and what we were doing was a very surprising thing for apparently intelligent people to waste their time on. My message to young researchers is, don't be put off if everyone tells you what you are doing is silly""—Geoffrey Hinton
“What we have seen is nothing short of a paradigm shift in the science. History turned their way, and I am in awe”—Oren Etzioni, Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence
[In October 2012, when a convolutional neural network achieved an error rate of only 16% in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge, a significant improvement over the 25% error rate achieved by the best entry the year before,] “The difference there was so great that a lot of people, you could see a big switch in their head going ‘clunk.’ Now they were convinced”—Yann LeCun
“…science worked the way it's meant to work… until we could produce results that were clearly better than the current state of the art, people were very skeptical”—Geoffrey Hinton
“This is not just a Turing Award for these particular people. It’s recognition that machine learning has become a central field in computer science”—Pedro Domingos, University of Washington
[Anyone hoping to make the next Turing-winning breakthrough in AI] “should not follow the trend—which right now is deep learning”—Yoshua Bengio
“Whether we’ll able to use new methods to create human-level intelligence, well, there’s probably another 50 mountains to climb, including ones we can’t even see yet. We’ve only climbed the first mountain. Maybe the second”—Yann LeCun
AI is not perfect and will never be. Same as the humans using AI.
68% of Facebook, Google (YouTube), Reddit and Twitter employees think their companies have not done enough to stop the spread of violent content online (Blind’s Work Talk Blog).
“Many people have asked why artificial intelligence (AI) didn’t detect the video from last week’s attack automatically. AI has made massive progress over the years and in many areas, which has enabled us to proactively detect the vast majority of the content we remove. But it’s not perfect… this particular video did not trigger our automatic detection systems. To achieve that we will need to provide our systems with large volumes of data of this specific kind of content, something which is difficult as these events are thankfully rare”—Guy Rosen, VP, Product Management, Facebook
AI is not perfect. Smart and well-endowed people hope it can be improved by establishing research and education centers focusing on “multidisciplinary collaboration and diversity of thought”
MIT President Rafael Reif said the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing will train students in an interdisciplinary approach to AI. It will also train them to take a step back and weigh potential downsides of AI, which is poised to disrupt “every sector of our society.”
Stanford University is launching a new institute committed to studying, guiding and developing human-centered artificial intelligence technologies and applications. The Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI) is building on a tradition of leadership in artificial intelligence at the university, as well as a focus on multidisciplinary collaboration and diversity of thought. The mission of the institute is to advance artificial intelligence (AI) research, education, policy and practice to improve the human condition.
“There’s no reason why computers can’t think like we [do] and can’t be ethical and moral like we aspire to be”—Patrick H. Winston, the Ford Professor of Engineering at MIT
MIT’s Marvin Minsky (1969) and Stanford’s John McCarthy (1971) received the Turing award for their pioneering AI work. Both saw the development of computers that think like we do as the primary goal of AI. Have they failed only because they have gone about achieving this goal with the wrong approach (encoding logic instead of improving machine learning, as this year’s Turing laureates have done) or because the goal itself led them astray? Does “diversity of thought” mean including researchers and practitioners that do not agree with the assumption that computers could be made to think like us (Minsky: “The human brain is just a computer that happens to be made out of meat”)? Will abandoning this goal and questioning this assumption help improve and advance “AI”?

The worldwide burger chain has made a $300-million investment in such personalization, acquiring Dynamic Yield, an Israeli artificial intelligence start-up.
Dynamic Yield has built technology focused on decision logicOpens a new window , which personalizes products based on customers’ former selections. McDonald’s wants to use the advance to become the fast-food leader in customizing its drive-through windows to meet changing conditions, including trending menu items, time of day and weather.
It’s a way for McDonald’s to push its other technological advances, such as self-order kiosks, to the next level .
“What we hadn’t done is begun to connect the technology together, and get the various pieces talking to each other,” McDonald’s CEO Steve Easterbrook toldOpens a new window  Wired. “How do you transition from mass marketing to mass personalization? To do that, you’ve really got to unlock the data within that ecosystem in a way that’s useful to a customer.”
The concept driving the purchase is predictive analyticsOpens a new window , as McDonald’s works to make better use of the information its customers provide, using it to further push sales by suggesting that customers add a few well-chosen items to their order.
Dynamic Yield, which also includes Ikea, Sephora and Urban Outfitters as customers, sees a host of fields ripe for personalization through its technology. It offers on its web site to customize experiences in industries ranging from financial services to gaming to retail.
The company says its platforms can help companies change formerly static content into personalized experiences, tailor page layouts to visitors’ preferences and automate content personalization on a scale level.
“Let machine learning algorithms dynamically select the most relevant content for each user in carousels, multi-item banners and more, by syncing your personalization campaigns with fresh data feeds and creative libraries,” according to the company’s site.Opens a new window 
The beauty of the AI personalization technology developed by Dynamic Yield is that it can capture and analyze the information gathered by various transaction mechanisms, including web, email, kiosks and call centers.
“The platform’s data management capabilities provide for a unified view of the customer, allowing the rapid and scalable creation of highly targeted digital interactions,” writes CrunchbaseOpens a new window  in an analysis of the company.
The new technology is all part of McDonald’s gamble that artificial intelligenceOpens a new window  can help it become more competitive in a tough industry.
“The AI-powered personalization initiative could help McDonald’s upsell products to customers based on their orders, such as by detecting an order made for children and suggesting a snack for the parent picking it up,” accordingOpens a new window  to RetailTouchpoints.
The fast-food company plans to add the technology to 1,000 of its restaurants in the coming months, eventually expanding it to the company’s 14,000 locations.
Artificial intelligence is driving this form of marketing, which is expected to grow in popularity and move into new fieldsOpens a new window .
“There are many tangible benefits of mapping your customer’s journey, including improved efficiency within your internal operations and better end results for sales,” says Greg KihstromOpens a new window , senior vice president of Digital at Yes&, a performance-based marketing agency in Washington, D.C. “Increasingly, marketers are turning to automation, personalization and artificial intelligence to enhance the customer experience within that journey.”
The reason AI-based marketing is so successful is that it works: A 2017 Personalization Report foundOpens a new window  that 44&percnt; of customers will likely become repeat buyers based on personalized shopping experiences.
And AI-aided menu selections are likely to trigger unplanned spending. Nearly 50&percnt; of U.S. shoppers have said that they bought a product in the last three months they had not planned to after the brand made a personalized recommendation.
Company representatives have said they hope eventually to include license-plate recognition as part of their strategy, enabling artificial intelligence to identify your car and make suitable suggestions accordingly.
“When you look at the answers that this decision engine provides, it may not seem so obvious to begin with, but for customers it makes sense,” says Daniel Henry, McDonald’s EVP and global CIO. “It’s not just about the individual, it’s also taking training information from other customers. It’s only going to get smarter and smarter, the more customers interact with it.”

Illustration by Alex Castro / The VergeLast week, Google announced that it is creating a new external ethics board to guide its “responsible development of AI.” On the face of it, this seemed like an admirable move, but the company was hit with immediate criticism.Researchers from Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and top universities objected to the board’s inclusion of Kay Coles James, the president of right-wing think tank The Heritage Foundation. They pointed out that James and her organization campaign against anti-discrimination laws for LGBTQ groups and sponsor climate change denial, making her unfit to offer ethical advice to the world’s most powerful AI company. An open petition demanding James’ removal was launched (it currently has more than 1,700 signatures), and as part of the backlash, one member of the newly formed board resigned.Google has yet to say anything about all of this (it didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment from The Verge), but to many in the AI community, it’s a clear example of Big Tech’s inability to deal honestly and openly with the ethics of its work. Ethics boards and charters aren’t changing how companies operateThis might come as a surprise if you’ve followed recent debates over AI ethics. In the past few years, tech companies certainly seem to have embraced ethical self-scrutiny: establishing ethics boards, writing ethics charters, and sponsoring research in topics like algorithmic bias. But are these boards and charters doing anything? Are they changing how these companies work or holding them accountable in any meaningful way? Academic Ben Wagner says tech’s enthusiasm for ethics paraphernalia is just “ethics washing,” a strategy to avoid government regulation. When researchers uncover new ways for technology to harm marginalized groups or infringe on civil liberties, tech companies can point to their boards and charters and say, “Look, we’re doing something.” It deflects criticism, and because the boards lack any power, it means the companies don’t change.“Most of the ethics principles developed now lack any institutional framework,” Wagner tells The Verge. “They’re non-binding. This makes it very easy for companies to look [at ethical issues] and go, ‘That’s important,’ but continue with whatever it is they were doing beforehand.” Think of it like CEO Jack Dorsey’s repeated assurances that’s he thinking hard about Twitter’s problems with abuse, harassment, and neo-Nazis. He keeps thinking, and things on the site stay pretty much the same. At a certain point, all of this contemplation looks like a substitute for actual policy change.An ethics explosionGoogle isn’t the only company with an ethics board and charter, of course. Its London AI subsidiary DeepMind has one, too, though it’s never revealed who’s on it or what they’re up to. Microsoft has its own AI principles, and it founded its AI ethics committee in 2018. Amazon has started sponsoring research into “fairness in artificial intelligence” with the help of the National Science Foundation, while Facebook has even co-founded an AI ethics research center in Germany. Despite their proliferation, these programs tend to share fundamental weaknesses, says Rumman Chowdhury, a data scientist and lead for responsible AI at management consultancy Accenture. One of the most important points is that they lack transparency. Chowdhury notes that many of society’s most important institutions, from universities to hospitals, have, over time, developed effective review boards that represent the institutions’ values in the public interest. But in the case of Big Tech, it’s unclear whose interests are being represented. “This board cannot make changes, it can just make suggestions.”“It’s not that people are against governance bodies, but we have no transparency into how they’re built,” Chowdhury tells The Verge. With regard to Google’s most recent board, she says, “This board cannot make changes, it can just make suggestions. They can’t talk about it with the public. So what oversight capabilities do they have?”When boards do make interventions, only the company who operates it really knows why. When Microsoft set up its AI ethics oversight committee Aether, for example, the company said that “significant sales” had been cut off because of the group’s recommendations. But it’s never explained what customers or applications were vetoed. Where exactly does Microsoft draw the line on unethical uses of AI? Only the company itself knows. A report last year from research institute AI Now said there’s been a “rush to adopt” ethical codes, but there’s no corresponding introduction of mechanisms that can “backstop these ... commitments.” The report points out that there’s also scant evidence on a corporate and an individual level if these codes and charters even have much effect.One study from 2018 tried to test whether codes of conduct could influence programmers’ ethical decision-making. It quizzed two groups of developers with a set of hypothetical problems they might face at work. Before answering, one group was told to consider a code of ethics issued by the Association for Computing Machinery, while the other group was simply told the fictional firm they worked for had strong ethical principles. The study found that priming test subjects with the code of ethics “had no observed effect” on their answers. Things are equally discouraging when considering how companies act. Google, for example, only created its AI ethics charter after employees objected to its work in helping the Pentagon design analytics tools for drones. After this, it continued to develop its censored Chinese search engine, a project that will probably involve AI to some degree and that many think infringes human rights.

An interest in ethical algorithms doesn’t stop companies from assisting deeply unethical causes.These problems don’t mean AI ethics boards should be done away with completely. These are hard problems, and discussing best practices for algorithmic systems raises awareness of their potential flaws. With so much expertise working for big tech companies, it would be foolish to shut these firms out of the conversation. But if we are to believe that these projects will be enough to keep society safe from the most harmful effects of new technology, we need to go further.“Trust us, we’re plenty ethical”Part of the problem is that Silicon Valley is convinced that it can police itself, says Chowdhury. “It’s just ingrained in the thinking there that, ‘We’re the good guys, we’re trying to help,” she says. The cultural influences of libertarianism and cyberutopianism have made many engineers distrustful of government intervention. But now these companies have as much power as nation states without the checks and balances to match. “This is not about technology; this is about systems of democracy and governance,” says Chowdhury. “And when you have technologists, VCs, and business people thinking they know what democracy is, that is a problem.”The solution many experts suggest is government regulation. It’s the only way to ensure real oversight and accountability. In a political climate where breaking up big tech companies has become a presidential platform, the timing seems right. Jack Poulson, a former researcher at Google who resigned over the company’s work on its censored Chinese search engine, says that even the recent backlash over Google’s ethics board is something of a distraction compared to this bigger issue. “The major battle is accountability.”“In a sense, we are playing into their hands by polarizing [the issue of] ethics,” Poulson tells The Verge. “The major battle is accountability. And accountability is less likely if we polarize what is currently bipartisan concern over Big Tech.” Legislation is proven to work, too. Last week, Facebook was charged by the US government for allowing customers to target ads at users based on their ethnicity. It marks the first time federal anti-discrimination laws have been applied in this area. As Ben Carson, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, put it: “Using a computer to limit a person’s housing choices can be just as discriminatory as slamming a door in someone’s face.” It’s not hard to imagine biased AI systems being prosecuted along similar lines. The difficult task now is finding crossovers between existing legislation and the malicious impact of new technology. After that, new legislation needs to be drafted to fill the gaps. Chowdhury says that since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke last year, there’s been a renewed interest among US lawmakers to tackle these problems. But a major problem is a lack of familiarity with the technology. As was demonstrated during Mark Zuckerberg’s congressional hearings, the people in charge of reining in these tech companies often know little about the tech itself. “They are trying their best, absolutely trying their best, to grapple with something that is completely outside their wheelhouse,” says Chowdhury of US politicians. “But a lot of the power — the intellectual knowledge — is held by the very bodies they would regulate.” That could mean that, as with the establishment of ethics boards, these firms get to shape the way they’re regulated. As Poulson puts it, “Why do tech companies get to choose their own critics?” It’s a dynamic that’s long worked in tech’s favor, and we’re seeing it action right now, with Zuckerberg calling for regulation of Facebook but on the company’s own terms. Wagner notes that whatever steps are made to regulate AI, the thinking has to be global, not US-centric. The technologies being developed by Google, Amazon, and others will be deployed around the world, and decisions made in America will affect more than just Americans. “We saw this with stuff like Facebook going into Myanmar,” he says. “This is a global challenge.” Comments0 Comments / 0 NewFeatured Videos From The VergeTesla’s big, epic, confusing future | The Vergecast

IBM offers similar evidence. The company has been vocal about its ethical efforts in AI, and last year, it created an ethnically diverse dataset to help remove racial bias from facial recognition systems. Reports from The Intercept have detailed how, as recently as 2016, the company’s surveillance tech was used by police forces in the Philippines where thousands have been killed in “extrajudicial executions” as part of a brutal war on drugs. An interest in ethical algorithms doesn’t stop companies from assisting deeply unethical causes.

But if we are to believe that these projects will be enough to keep society safe from the most harmful effects of new technology, we need to go further.

“Trust us, we’re plenty ethical”

Part of the problem is that Silicon Valley is convinced that it can police itself, says Chowdhury. 

“It’s just ingrained in the thinking there that, ‘We’re the good guys, we’re trying to help,” she says. The cultural influences of libertarianism and cyberutopianism have made many engineers distrustful of government intervention. But now these companies have as much power as nation states without the checks and balances to match. “This is not about technology; this is about systems of democracy and governance,” says Chowdhury. “And when you have technologists, VCs, and business people thinking they know what democracy is, that is a problem.”

Jack Poulson, a former researcher at Google who resigned over the company’s work on its censored Chinese search engine, says that even the recent backlash over Google’s ethics board is something of a distraction compared to this bigger issue. 

""“The major battle is accountability.”""

“In a sense, we are playing into their hands by polarizing [the issue of] ethics,” Poulson tells The Verge. “The major battle is accountability. And accountability is less likely if we polarize what is currently bipartisan concern over Big Tech.” 

Legislation is proven to work, too. Last week, Facebook was charged by the US government for allowing customers to target ads at users based on their ethnicity. It marks the first time federal anti-discrimination laws have been applied in this area. As Ben Carson, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, put it: “Using a computer to limit a person’s housing choices can be just as discriminatory as slamming a door in someone’s face.” It’s not hard to imagine biased AI systems being prosecuted along similar lines. 

The difficult task now is finding crossovers between existing legislation and the malicious impact of new technology. After that, new legislation needs to be drafted to fill the gaps. 

Chowdhury says that since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke last year, there’s been a renewed interest among US lawmakers to tackle these problems. But a major problem is a lack of familiarity with the technology. As was demonstrated during Mark Zuckerberg’s congressional hearings, the people in charge of reining in these tech companies often know little about the tech itself. 

“They are trying their best, absolutely trying their best, to grapple with something that is completely outside their wheelhouse,” says Chowdhury of US politicians. “But a lot of the power — the intellectual knowledge — is held by the very bodies they would regulate.” 

That could mean that, as with the establishment of ethics boards, these firms get to shape the way they’re regulated. As Poulson puts it, “Why do tech companies get to choose their own critics?” It’s a dynamic that’s long worked in tech’s favor, and we’re seeing it action right now, with Zuckerberg calling for regulation of Facebook but on the company’s own terms. 

Wagner notes that whatever steps are made to regulate AI, the thinking has to be global, not US-centric. The technologies being developed by Google, Amazon, and others will be deployed around the world, and decisions made in America will affect more than just Americans. “We saw this with stuff like Facebook going into Myanmar,” he says. “This is a global challenge.”

The food-and-beverage company behind brands such as Pepsi, Gatorade, Tropicana, Lipton, Frito-Lay, and Quaker sells products in more than 200 countries and brought in $64.7 billion in annual revenue last year. From robots to machine learning, PepsiCo uses AI and machine learning throughout the organization in many ways.








The Fascinating Ways PepsiCo Uses Artificial Intelligence And Machine Learning To Deliver Success

Snack Delivery Robot
There’s a six-wheeled mobile vending machine robot tooling around the University of the Pacific chockful of PepsiCo snacks and beverages from Hello Goodness—a healthier line-up that includes SunChips, Baked Lay’s and bubly sparkling water. Named Snackbot, these self-driving robots are a partnership between Robby Technologies and PepsiCo. Students can order their snacks from the Snackbot app, and then the robot will deliver it to more than 50 spots across the campus without charging a delivery fee. The bots have a range of 20 miles on a single battery charge, and they can even navigate at night, in rain or up curbs thanks to onboard headlights and all-wheel drive capabilities.
Snackbot represents the solution to the needs of strapped-for-time college students and their preferences identified through PepsiCo’s research. There are three to five Snackbots on campus to keep up with demand.
PROMOTED
Manufacturing with Machine Learning
The Frito-Lay (a subsidiary of PepsiCo) manufacturing plant is benefiting from machine learning. One project uses lasers to hit chips and then listen to the sounds coming off the chip to determine texture. Algorithms process the sound and determine the chip texture to automate the quality check for Frito-Lay’s chip processing systems.
From this beginning, Shameer Mirza, senior research and development engineer at PepsiCo, realized several more applications of machine learning could impact process control within the factory. Next, Mirza developed a machine learning model that could be used with a vision system to be able to predict the weight of potatoes being processed. This led to considerable savings for the company because it no longer had to spend $300,000 per line (they had 35 in the U.S. alone) for weighing elements. Mirza's systems used only a camera and the machine learning model and are essentially just additional data points collected with no additional cost.
Another project still in development would assess the ""percent peel"" of a potato after it had gone through the peeling process. By understanding this data, it can help the Frito-Lay team to optimize the potato peeling system. This project alone is estimated to save the company more than $1 million a year just in the United States.
PepsiCo is launching a global training course on advanced machine learning and computer vision for its internal research and development associates this year to broaden its team's abilities to use these technologies to continue finding insights that will drive efficiencies in its manufacturing facilities.
Vera Streamlines the Hiring Process
PepsiCo used Robot Vera for the first time to phone and interview candidates for open positions in sales, as drivers and to fill factory vacancies in Russia when HR professionals needed to fill 250 jobs in two months. Vera was developed by Russian startup Stafory and is capable of interviewing 1,500 candidates in nine hours, a job that would take humans nine weeks.
Advanced speech recognition software and tools from Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Russian technology company Yandex allow Vera to make calls and screen candidates for open positions such as fork-lift operators, factory workers, and sales staff. Its software can scan CVs to determine if a potential candidate has the right experience for the position, can respond to yes and no answers, ask follow-up questions and send out follow-up correspondence. It can also forward transcripts of a call to a human HR specialist for further review. So far, the reception from the majority of candidates when dealing with the robot has been positive. There was a bit more hesitation from human HR professionals. It turns out one of the biggest hurdles is ""reprogramming humans"" to feel comfortable with the technology.
PepsiCo’s In-House Technology Platform Ada
Ada provides “augmented intelligence” that relies on human’s insight in combination with algorithms. The company expects this philosophy will lead to rapid learning. Ada can pull together data from a variety of sources to allow PepsiCo to better leverage the massive amounts of data it collects. Ultimately, Ada will be involved in all aspects of operations including innovation, design, research and price decisions.
Other areas that PepsiCo will put data to use is in product development and sales and marketing. The company has used social prediction tools that aggregate publicly available consumer conversations in combination with its own data to identify new products to bring to market. This represents a transition for the company to create insights from the data it has and focus it on actionable activities. As more and more data get layered, PepsiCo is able to identify trends and marketing placements.
Pep Worx: Big Data and Analytics Platform
The cloud-based data and analytics platform PepsiCo uses called Pep Worx helps the company advise retail stores on the best items to stock, where to place them and what promotions to use. When the company wanted to launch Quaker Overnight Oats, it was able to identify 24 million households from a dataset of 110 million US households that it felt would be appropriate to market the product to. Then, PepsiCo identified the shopping venues that these households would be more apt to use and created promotions to appeal to that audience. This use of data and focusing on a very specific market helped drive 80 percent of the product’s sales growth in the first 12 months after launch.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The question of whether technology is good or bad depends on how it’s developed and used. Nowhere is that more topical than in technolgies using artificial intelligence.
When developed and used appropriately, artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform the way we live, work, communicate and travel. 
New AI-enabled medical technologies are being developed to improve patient care. There are persuasive indications that autonomous vehicles will improve safety and reduce the road toll. Machine learning and automation are streamlining workflows and allowing us to work smarter.

      To protect us from the risks of advanced artificial intelligence, we need to act now




Around the world, AI-enabled technology is increasingly being adopted by individuals, governments, organisations and institutions. But along with the vast potential to improve our quality of life, comes a risk to our basic human rights and freedoms. 
Appropriate oversight, guidance and understanding of the way AI is used and developed in Australia must be prioritised.
AI gone wild may conjure images of The Terminator and Ex Machina movies, but it is much simpler, fundamental issues that need to be addressed at present, such as:

how data is used to develop AI
whether an AI system is being used fairly
in which situations should we continue to rely on human decision-making?

We have an AI ethics plan
That’s why, in partnership with government and industry, we’ve developed an ethics framework for AI in Australia. The aim is to catalyse the discussion around how AI should be used and developed in Australia.
The ethical framework looks at various case studies from around the world to discuss how AI has been used in the past and the impacts that it has had. The case studies help us understand where things went wrong and how to avoid repeating past mistakes.
We also looked at what was being done around the world to address ethical concerns about AI development and use.

Based on the core issues and impacts of AI, eight principles were identified to support the ethical use and development of AI in Australia.

Generates net benefits: The AI system must generate benefits for people that are greater than the costs.
Do no harm: Civilian AI systems must not be designed to harm or deceive people and should be implemented in ways that minimise any negative outcomes.
Regulatory and legal compliance: The AI system must comply with all relevant international, Australian local, state/territory and federal government obligations, regulations and laws.
Privacy protection: Any system, including AI systems, must ensure people’s private data is protected and kept confidential and prevent data breaches that could cause reputational, psychological, financial, professional or other types of harm.
Fairness: The development or use of the AI system must not result in unfair discrimination against individuals, communities or groups. This requires particular attention to ensure the “training data” is free from bias or characteristics which may cause the algorithm to behave unfairly.
Transparency and explainability: People must be informed when an algorithm is being used that impacts them and they should be provided with information about what information the algorithm uses to make decisions.
Contestability: When an algorithm impacts a person there must be an efficient process to allow that person to challenge the use or output of the algorithm.
Accountability: People and organisations responsible for the creation and implementation of AI algorithms should be identifiable and accountable for the impacts of that algorithm, even if the impacts are unintended.

In addition to the core principles various toolkit items are identified in the framework that could be used to help support these principles. These include impact assessments, ongoing monitoring and public consultation.
A plan, what about action?
But principles and ethical goals can only go so far. At some point we will need to get to work on deciding how we are going to implement and achieve them. 
There are various complexities to consider when discussing the ethical use and development of AI. The vast reach of the technology has potential to impact every facet of our lives.
AI applications are already in use across households, businesses and governments, most Australians are already being impacted by them. 
There is a pressing need to examine the effects that AI has on the vulnerable and on minority groups, making sure we protect these individuals and communities from bias, discrimination and exploitation. (Remember Tay, the racist chatbot?)
There is also the fact that AI used in Australia will often be developed in other countries, so how do we ensure it adheres to Australian standards and expectations?
Your say
The framework explores these issues and forms some of Australia’s first steps on the journey towards the positive development and use of AI. But true progress needs input from stakeholders across government, business, academia and broader society.

      Careful how you treat today's AI: it might take revenge in the future




That’s why ethical framework discussion paper is now open to public comment. You have until May 31, 2019, to have your say in Australia’s digital future.
With a proactive approach to the ethical development of AI, Australia can do more than just mitigate against any risks. If we can build AI for a fairer go, we can secure a competitive advantage as well as safeguard the rights of Australians.

Allied Irish Banks (AIB) has announced a partnership with Boxever to improve the customer experience with Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Boxever will work with AIB for a three-year period during which it will aim to improve the user experience of the bank’s customers. Thanks to Boxever’s technology, AIB will give greater priority to the customer, offering true results and one-to-one customisation. 
Boxever, in fact, is a personalisation engine that uses data and artificial intelligence (AI) to help companies improve their customer interactions and offer new user experiences.
First and foremost, Boxever builds accurate customer profiles from the data extracted from all their activities within the company’s platform. Artificial intelligence is then used to automate decisions on how to personalise interactions on each channel and at any time.
Thanks to this partnership with AIB, Boxever is also expanding into the financial services sector, where customers have more complex and rapidly evolving habits and desires. 
AIB, on the other hand, is a financial services group mainly active in the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom. 
Seamus Murphy, Chief Digital Officer of AIB, said: 

“Our customers’ expectations are shifting rapidly. We have to be agile and keep ahead of this change to continue to offer a market-leading experience. Boxever’s personalisation platform will help us to do just that – allowing us to reach our customers with the right message, at the right time and through the right channel. This partnership with an indigenous Irish company will add some of the industry’s best technology and expertise to our digital transformation effort”.

Dave O’Flanagan, CEO of Boxever, said: 

“We’re really excited about partnering with AIB as we continue to expand our presence in the financial services sector. Together we will work to enhance the experience for AIB’s customers, and drive positive results throughout their business. It’s going to be fascinating to see the impact our industry-leading personalisation platform – powered by data and AI – will have for the AIB and its customers as we move forward together”.

In partnership with IDC, Microsoft unveils the Malaysia findings of its study on Artificial Intelligence – to analyse how Malaysia is embracing AI, the impact of AI on Malaysia’s businesses & economy 
Despite clear benefits in adopting the technology, only 26% of organizations in Malaysia today have embarked on their AI journeys.
Culture and Skills are among key barriers for organizations to succeed in AI. 

Malaysia, 2 April, 2019 – By 2021, Artificial Intelligence (AI) will allow the rate of innovation to almost double (x1.8) and increase employee productivity improvements by 60% in Malaysia, according to the country’s business leaders. The study from Microsoft and IDC Asia/Pacific, Future Ready Business: Assessing Asia Pacific’s Growth Potential Through AI surveyed 100 business leaders and 100 workers in Malaysia.

While seven in 10 business leaders polled agreed that AI is instrumental for their organization’s competitiveness, only 26% of organizations in Malaysia have embarked on their AI journeys. Those companies that have adopted AI expect it to increase their competitiveness by 2.2 times in 2021.
While seven in 10 business leaders polled agreed that AI is instrumental for their organization’s competitiveness, only 26% of organizations in Malaysia have embarked on their AI journeys. Those companies that have adopted AI expect it to increase their competitiveness by 2.2 times in 2021.
“Today, every company is a software company, and increasingly, every interaction is digital. To be successful in this new world, organizations need to be a fast adopter of best-in-class technology; and secondly, they need to build their own unique digital capabilities,” said K Raman, Managing Director, Microsoft Malaysia. “AI is the defining technology of our time that significantly accelerates business transformation, enables innovation, boosts employee productivity, and ensures further growth.  Economies and businesses that have yet to embark on their AI journey run a real risk of missing out on the competitive benefits that are enjoyed by leaders.”
Why adopt AI?
For the organizations that have implemented AI initiatives, the top five business drivers to adopt the technology were (in priority order): Better customer engagements and higher competitiveness (both tied as the number one driver with 31% respondents respectively); accelerated innovation and improved efficiency (12%); as well as more productive employees (8%).
Jun-Fwu Chin, Research Director for IDC Asia Pacific Datacenter Group said: “Last year, organizations that have adopted AI saw tangible improvements in those areas in the range of 17% to 34%. They forecast further improvements of at least 1.6 times in the three-year horizon, with the biggest jump expected in accelerated innovation, higher competitiveness and better customer engagements.”

Malaysia needs to build on AI culture, as well as the rest of the dimensions
The study evaluated six dimensions critical to ensuring the success of a nation’s AI journey. It uncovered that Malaysia needs to focus on improving on all areas, particularly its data and investments in order to accelerate its AI journey.
“Malaysia is not ready yet for AI. To succeed in AI race, Malaysia needs to substantially improve its readiness.  Organizations’ leadership should make AI a core part of their strategy and develop a learning agility culture. They have to continuously invest in this transformative technology for the long-term success, sometimes without immediate returns,” Chin said. “There is an urgent need for talents and tools to develop, deploy and monitor AI models, along with the availability of a robust data estate with the adequate governance.”
Business leaders who are adopting AI face three top challenges a lack of thought leadership and leadership commitment to invest in AI; lack of skills, resources and continuous learning programs and lack of advanced analytics or adequate infrastructure and tools to develop actionable insights.
The study showed that to move ahead on their AI journeys businesses must create the right organizational culture. Majority of business leaders and workers surveyed believe that cultural traits that support AI journeys, such as risk-taking, proactive innovation, as well as cross-function partnerships among teams, are not pervasive today. “Overall, workers in Malaysia are more sceptical than business leaders about the cultural readiness of their organizations,” added Chin.

“Business leaders must now embrace a new culture, where innovation and continuous learning are core components of the organizational culture. It sets the stage for agility, adaptability and growth,” said Raman.
Organizations need to address skills challenge for an AI-enabled workforce
The study found that Malaysia’s business leaders and workers hold positive viewpoints about the AI’s impact on the future of jobs. More than half (67% of business leaders and 64% of workers) believe that AI will either help to do their existing jobs better or reduce repetitive tasks.
“When it comes to creating or replacing jobs, 17% of business leaders believe that AI will create new jobs, while 10% also feel that the technology will replace. Interestingly, workers are more optimistic, with only 7% expecting AI to replace jobs, and 18% to create new ones. At the same time, almost 11% of workers expect no impact to their jobs in three years from now.” said Chin.

The study also found that workers are more willing to reskill than business leaders believe they are. 23% of business leaders felt that workers have no interest to develop new skills, whereas only 10% of workers are not interested.
“Microsoft’s vision for AI is first and foremost about people. AI technology cannot progress without them. This means that millions will need to transform themselves into skilled workers as well as learners that an AI future needs,” said Raman. “It is heartening to see that 82% of businesses prioritize skilling and reskilling of workers in the future. They plan to invest as much, or even more, in human capital than in new technology. Even so, 72% of business leaders have yet to implement plans to help their employees’ to acquire the right skills, which is worrying in today’s context. They must have the urgency to support the fundamental shift in training workers for the future.”
The Microsoft AI study surveyed 1,605 business decision markets, and 1,585 workers from 15 markets participated in it. This included 100 business leaders and 100 workers in Malaysia.
Also present, Dr Karl Ng Kah Hou, Director, Data Economy, of Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC) later commented, “As technology changes the rules of business, it is imperative to future-proof the Malaysian economy by building a strong digital innovation ecosystem. The potential of Artificial Intelligence is far from being fully exploited thus making now the best time for Malaysia to sprint to the front of the race. Malaysian businesses need to jump onto the bandwagon to embrace digital transformation and leverage digital technologies such as AI to accelerate the shift towards 4IR and retain their competitive edge.”

Many of the manufacturing units' processes and machine-to-machine interactions have become complex and AI is here to bring simplicity and efficiency to it..Below is a rundown that describes how AI is being used within Industry 4.0 – a name was given to the current trend of automation..Generative Design.Designers and engineers, by giving a clearly defined design as an input, can use AI algorithms (predominantly known as generative design software) to consider conceivable versions of a solution. The solutions obtained can be used to determine which idea worked and which did not, thus advising an optimal solution..Supply Chain Management.Supply Chain is the pillar of the manufacturing unit. Many manufacturers have composite supply chains having various components and specialty tools. Any delay, breakdown or fault can cause a product assembly point to come to a halt. To determine the estimations of market demand, an algorithm can be used to take into account distinguishing demand patterns. Manufacturers can use this data to optimize inventory control, staffing, energy consumption, and make preferable financial decisions..According to a report by McKinsey &amp; Company, AI-enhanced supply chain management can help companies reduce forecasting errors by 20-50% to optimize stock replenishment..Hybrid Workforce.Development in the field of AI is paving way for shared environments where man and machine work alongside. Thanks to AI and machine learning, robots no longer perform monotonous and repetitive tasks. Collaborative and context-aware robots will improve production throughput in labor-intensive settings, and will increase productivity to 20% for certain tasks, says McKinsey..Predictive Maintenance.AI-enabled tools can foretell when the equipment is expected for maintenance. By means of embedding sensors in manufacturing equipment, AI can capture data like energy consumption of individual machines, study maintenance cycles, scan for the possibility of a defect and then optimize them in the following stage. As the volume of data increases, the system improves at perfecting itself and makes more precise predictions. McKinsey reports that AI-driven predictive maintenance can increase asset productivity by up to 20% and reduce maintenance charges up to 10%..Safer Systems.AI can help increase safety by automating risky activities. Facilitating robots with AI, high-risk jobs can be taken care of with minimum impact. These bots can work in unsafe environments while collecting, tracking, transmitting, and analyzing data at an accuracy level not done by the existing systems..Yield Enhancement .Manufacturers can now use AI systems to decrease scrap rates from faulty products and increase value out of the resources involved in the assembly process..While AI will metamorphose factories in incredible ways, it will also bring forth challenges. According to an Infosys survey, 37% of manufacturers believe that training will be a notable issue when it comes to deploying AI. Some 32% of manufacturers admitted to a need for knowledge about how AI can help the business..The use of AI appears as an innovative leap forward for many in the manufacturing sector. At length, this means implanting &quot;learnability&quot; in employees through a methodical process of established learning..The long-term contribution of AI in the sector is inevitable. While the positives of AI keep on outweighing the negatives, the successful mantra of using AI is to balance: significant automation but with comparable importance on people participation and skill expansion..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

The fear that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Robots will automate many jobs has been growing as technological change accelerates. Some studies have predicted that 40-50% of US jobs could be automated in the next 20 years, and many people are worried that they could be forced into retirement. Per this Oxford Study: 

 “47 percent of U.S. workers have a high probability of seeing their jobs automated over the next 20 years.” 
Is this time different?
The world has navigated a number of industrial revolutions in the past:
PROMOTED

First Industrial Revolution - Steam & Mechanical Production - 1700s & 1800s 
Second Industrial Revolution - Electricity & Mass Production 1870 to 1914
Third Industrial Revolution - Digital Revolution - 1980s
Fourth Industrial Revolution - AI, Robotics, Networks, BioTechnology, Internet of Things - Today

Each time many jobs were lost, but we created new ones and overall employment stayed high after the initial disruption. But this time it feels different partly due to the fact that real wage growth has been low to flat for many people meaning their standard of living isn’t rising. As we’ve become more productive through automation and globalization the share of GDP that goes to labor has fallen, while the share to capital has risen. Basically it’s better to be an investor rather than a worker - unless you have special skills.
Plus it seems like every week there are new headlines announcing new AI and Robot capabilities:

Self driving cars & trucks
Legal research automated
Telemarketing replaced by robo-callers
News articles getting generated by AI
Robots that can open doors, navigate the woods and do flips






Is the fear overblown?
Some experts say yes. I spoke with Ken Goldberg a UC Berkeley Robotics Professor and Eric Brewer a VP at Google and UC Berkeley Computer Science Professor about AI Automation and the Future of Work on a recent podcast.  
Both felt that the fears around AI and Robotics destroying jobs or worse leading to the Singularity where AI takes over are overblown. The Singularity is a term promoted by Ray Kurzweil which predicts that based on Moore’s law and the doubling of computing power per dollar every few years that:

By 2023 a $1,000 computer will have the processing power of 1 human brain
By 2030 the Singularity will occur and runaway AI will emerge
By 2050 a $1,000 computer will have the processing power of all human brains

Instead both Professors feel that predictions like self driving cars will take much longer to play out, and that while some industries may face big disruptions the jobs that get automated will be the boring mundane jobs which will be replaced by more interesting, creative jobs.
Ken Goldberg in particular believes “Rather than worrying about an impending Singularity, consider instead the concept of Multiplicity: where diverse combinations of people and machines work together to solve problems and innovate.“
He’s also written about how AI may not be bad, but instead by good for workers in the Economist.
They are both hopeful for the future where we all learn new skills faster and live more diverse rich lives. Eric Brewer shared “I feel like our kids will grow up in a generation that expects that they can do whatever they want at any time. That’s super empowering.”
If you’re still worried about being forced into an early retirement - you can run your own scenario through this automated retirement calculator - and yes we are considering folding in AI and Machine Learning to help bring better results to more people at a lower cost.
The good news is that smart people are working every day to use technology to bring better solutions to more people to solve big problems across the world and all industries.Stephen ChenFollowingFollowI’m the founder and CEO of  NewRetirement.com .
