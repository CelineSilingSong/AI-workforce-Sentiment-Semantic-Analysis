Designed in 1770 by the inventor Wolfgang von Kempelen, the machine appeared to be able to defeat any human player.
It later turned out the Turk was in fact a mechanical illusion. A puppet dressed in oriental garb, it concealed under its fez and robes a human chess master. The American poet Edgar Allen Poe was so convinced of the Turk’s fraudulence that he wrote an essay to draw attention to the hoax.
A predetermined mechanism beating a human mind at chess was impossible, Poe claimed, for ""no one move in chess necessarily follows upon any one other. From no particular disposition of the men at one period of a game can we predicate their disposition at a different period.""
Today, artificial intelligence allows computers to make just such predictions, so it might be fair to assume that such naive illusions are behind us. After all, computers now exist that can beat any human at chess.
But a similar illusion characterises the artificial intelligence industry. On Amazon Mechanical Turk, an online platform owned and operated by Amazon since 2005, human activity is supposed to take the appearance of mechanical activity. The premise of Amazon Mechanical Turk is simple. The site hosts contractors, often large tech companies, which outsource short data tasks to a crowd of workers.
The workers fulfil the tasks that machine learning algorithms are not yet able to complete. Because the work is supposed to appear as if artificial intelligence is doing it, the former Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos, referred to the platform as ""artificial artificial intelligence"". The contractors tend to interact only with the platform, which hosts the tasks and sources the workers. Having little to no direct contact with the workers, contractors experience the process as if it were entirely fulfilled by computers.

""Computers are not as smart as you think they are"": The struggle of teaching AI to tell stories

Machine learning, the most common branch of AI training, relies on large data sets to train models which are then used to make predictions. Integrated into this process are algorithms that analyse data to extract patterns and make further predictions, which then use those predictions to generate further algorithms.
The richer the data these technologies are exposed to, the more comprehensive their training and the more sophisticated their capacities become, enhancing their performance in tasks as varied as image categorisation, text classification and speech recognition. In many areas, such developments have bestowed machines with capacities that frequently match or surpass those of humans. AI diagnosticians are already at least as proficient as doctors at identifying certain types of cancer.
But to find patterns and make predictions, the algorithm needs the input data to be labelled or categorised. An algorithm for an autonomous car, for instance, must be exposed to detailed, annotated images of urban areas before it can safely navigate a vehicle around a city centre. Artificial intelligence is not yet capable of annotating these images itself, so instead humans have to label them. For a task that supports the training of autonomous vehicles, this might involve labelling an image of a junction with the tags ‘pedestrian’, ‘traffic lights’ and ‘car’.
This kind of work, often known as ‘microwork’ – due to the brevity of the tasks – is becoming increasingly popular. Growing numbers of sites such as Clickworker, Appen and Playment now host large crowds of workers who undertake these short data tasks, often for very little payment. One study found that the average wage of a worker on Mechanical Turk is less than $2 an hour, with only 4 per cent of workers earning over $7.25 per hour, the US minimum wage. Tasks are very short, running from around 30 seconds to 30 minutes and often pay as little as a few cents.
The tasks can be very repetitive and are often opaque to the point of being impossible to relate to a larger project. A 2020 study by academics found that contractors often offer very little detailed information on their tasks and on the purposes they serve. This means that workers have little idea of what they are precisely working on. This is of particular concern when workers might be supporting a technology such as facial recognition software, which has serious ethical implications.
The work is also highly insecure. Workers are usually categorised as ‘independent contractors’, so they do not enjoy the rights and benefits afforded full-time employees working for the companies that contract them. This means that workers will usually work for multiple contractors over the course of a single day, which in turn means that workers must continually search for new tasks. A significant portion of the day must be given over to finding work, rather than actually doing work that pays.
The majority of this work is currently done in countries in the Global South such as India, Kenya and Venezuela. But some studies suggest that this kind of digital work is also on the rise in countries such as the UK.

Does Artificial Intelligence Really Reduce Jobs? A Historic Perspective
By Bronwyn Howell
RealClearPolicy
January 07, 2022



FacebookTwitterLinkedIn
Anxiety about a dystopian “future of work” caused by advances in artificial intelligence (AI) is the latest outbreak of a remarkably persistent meme with a very long history. Before rushing to panic, or intervening to minimize anticipated harms, it is helpful to pause, take a deep breath, and consider what we already know about the effects of technological change on labor markets, and how this might influence the current response.
First, human beings are terrible at predicting the future. While John Maynard Keynes may have had a lot to say about monetary policy, his 1930 predictions about technological unemployment arising from “our discovery of means of economising the use of labour outrunning the pace at which we can find new uses for labour” proved wide of the mark. Had he been correct, we would now be struggling with how to purposefully deploy all our newfound leisure time created by technological change rather than stressing about it taking away our jobs — not to mention working on average as many, if not more, hours per week as in 1930.
A more recent example of misleading forecasts comes in the form of autonomous vehicles. Heroic predictions in the early 2010s suggested that by the mid-2020s, truck driving would be consigned to the dustbin of history, alongside blacksmithing and other professions annihilated by the industrial revolution. Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted in 2016 that the company’s cars would be capable of a cross-country automated drive by “next year.” In 2019, he tweeted that “everyone with Tesla Full Self-Driving” would be able to do the same. Yet as 2022 dawns, it seems we are no nearer to ubiquitous autonomous vehicle nirvana than in 2012. Rather, the optimistic forecasts are now being downplayed, with one now suggesting that driverless vehicles will not be common and affordable until the 2050s or 2060s.
Second, we need to be aware of the manifest biases and fallacies that magnify the weight humans put on potential losses compared to potential future gains. As a result of these biases, humans often seek to preserve the status quo over pursuing activities that lead to future changes, even when the expected (but risky) gains from the latter may outweigh those of maintaining the status quo. The preference for the status quo, and neat narratives that oversimplify complex scenarios, can lead to overlooking (or ignoring) important information that is not consistent with the current generally accepted meme — illustrated, perhaps, in Musk’s continued optimism for autonomous vehicles despite the evidence leading to others downscaling their forecasts.
The first and second points together lead to the third important consideration: the importance of independently verified data over forecasts and opinion in determining the need for and appropriateness of policy interventions. And data is historical by nature. Pausing to collect it rather than rushing to respond is recommended.
To that end, we can use available data to analyze whether increasing use of AI is demonstrably affecting key labor market performance indicators: labor productivity and multifactor productivity growth. If, as Keynes suggests, AI-driven technological change is increasing the potential for new means of economizing the use of labor to outrun the pace of finding new ways to use it, we would expect to see both statistics rising in the era dominated by AI. Yet as Figures 1 and 2 show, the exact opposite appears true for a wide range of OECD countries. Neither does the data suggest that other key labor market indicators have changed negatively with the advent of AI. As with the computer industry, we see the effects of AI everywhere but in the productivity statistics.

Figure 2. Multifactor productivity: average annual growth rates, selected OECD countries, 1985–2019
Source: New Zealand Productivity Commission, OECD  
Indeed, the computer industry example provides perhaps a cogent explanation for these observations: the lump of labor fallacy. Proposed in 1891 by David Schloss, this is the misconception that both the amount of work to be done in an economy (and hence job supply) and the number of people who want work (and demand for jobs from workers) are inflexible. Yet the evidence shows this is far from the case. The introduction of spreadsheets dropped the price of running what-if accounting scenarios, and the demand for those scenarios was very responsive to price. Rather than decimating the market for accountants, spreadsheet software actually expanded it. The resources freed from calculating simple cases were deployed in accountants developing more complex scenarios to test.
The lesson from history is clear. While trying to get ahead of the game and protect workers’ interests is laudable, acting on predictions and pleadings rather than data risks harming the interests of those one seeks to protect.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is arguably the most exciting field in robotics. It's certainly the most controversial: Everybody agrees that a robot can work in an assembly line, but there's no consensus on whether a robot can ever be intelligent.
Like the term ""robot"" itself, artificial intelligence is hard to define. Ultimate AI would be a recreation of the human thought process — a human-made machine with our intellectual abilities. This would include the ability to learn just about anything, the ability to reason, the ability to use language and the ability to formulate original ideas. Roboticists are nowhere near achieving this level of artificial intelligence, but they have made a lot of progress with more limited AI. Today's AI machines can replicate some specific elements of intellectual ability.

Computers can already solve problems in limited realms. The basic idea of AI problem-solving is simple, though its execution is complicated. First, the AI robot or computer gathers facts about a situation through sensors or human input. The computer compares this information to stored data and decides what the information signifies. The computer runs through various possible actions and predicts which action will be most successful based on the collected information. For the most part, the computer can only solve problems it's programmed to solve — it doesn't have any generalized analytical ability. Chess computers are one example of this sort of machine.
Some modern robots also can learn in a limited capacity. Learning robots recognize if a certain action (moving its legs in a certain way, for instance) achieves a desired result (navigating an obstacle). The robot stores this information and attempts the successful action the next time it encounters the same situation. Robotic vacuums learn the layout of a room, but they're built for vacuuming and nothing else.
Some robots can interact socially. Kismet, a robot created in 1998 at M.I.T.'s Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL), recognized human body language and voice inflection and responded appropriately. Since then, interactive robots have become available commercially, and some are being used as companions for senior citizens. Although the robots are helpful for cleaning and mobility assistance, adding interactivity helps reduce seniors' social isolation.
The real challenge of AI is to understand how natural intelligence works. Developing AI isn't like building an artificial heart — scientists don't have a simple, concrete model to work from. We do know that the brain contains billions and billions of neurons, and that we think and learn by establishing electrical connections between different neurons. But we don't know exactly how all of these connections add up to higher reasoning, or even low-level operations. The complex circuitry seems incomprehensible.
Because of this, AI research is largely theoretical. Scientists hypothesize on how and why we learn and think, and they experiment with their ideas using robots. M.I.T. CSAIL researchers focus on humanoid robots because they feel that being able to experience the world like a human is essential to developing human-like intelligence. It also makes it easier for people to interact with the robots, which potentially makes it easier for the robot to learn.
Just as physical robotic design is a handy tool for understanding animal and human anatomy, AI research is useful for understanding how natural intelligence works. For some roboticists, this insight is the ultimate goal of designing robots. Others envision a world where we live side by side with intelligent machines and use a variety of lesser robots for manual labor, health care and communication. Some robotics experts predict that robotic evolution will ultimately turn us into cyborgs — humans integrated with machines. Conceivably, people in the future could load their minds into a sturdy robot and live for thousands of years!
In any case, robots will certainly play a larger role in our daily lives in the future. In the coming decades, robots will gradually move out of the industrial and scientific worlds and into daily life, in the same way that computers spread to the home in the 1980s.

AI job automation: The debate
The debate around whether AI will automate jobs away is heating up. AI critics claim that these statistical models lack the creativity and intuition of human workers and that they are thus doomed to specific, repetitive tasks. However, this pessimism fundamentally underestimates the power of AI. While AI job automation has already replaced around 400,000 factory jobs in the U.S. from 1990 to 2007, with another 2 million on the way, AI today is automating the economy in a much more subtle way.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



Robo-writers
Take the example of writing jobs. AI can easily generate text that is indistinguishable from human writing. This type of AI job automation is replacing workers in a way that is largely invisible to the naked eye.
For example, the popular AI copywriting app, Rytr, boasts over 600,000 users, and it’s growing at a brisk pace. In other words, over half a million people are using Rytr alone to fully or partially automate their writing.  It’s estimated that there are just over 1 million freelance writers around the world, who are increasingly competing with robots that don’t tire, don’t require payment, and can generate an unlimited amount of content.
The implications of this are serious: Classical projections for AI-induced job loss focused only on repetitive manual labor and blue-collar jobs. But white-collar jobs, like content writing, are just as vulnerable to AI replacement.
Robo-support
This trend is not limited to writing. AI is also automating jobs in customer service, accounting, and a host of other professions. For instance, companies like Thankful, Yext, and Forethought use AI to automate customer support. This shift is often imperceptible to the customer, who doesn’t know if they’re speaking to a biological intelligence or a machine. The rise of AI-powered customer service has big implications for the workforce. It’s estimated that 85 percent of customer interactions are already handled without human interaction.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are nearly 3 million customer service representatives employed in the United States. Many of these jobs are at risk of being replaced by AI. When jobs like these are automated away, the question is: Where do the displaced workers go?
The answer is not clear. It’s possible that many of these workers will be re-employed in other fields. But it’s also possible that they will become unemployed, and that the economy will struggle to absorb them. This is driving calls for a universal basic income, in which the government provides all citizens with a basic income to live on, to offset job losses due to automation.
Robo-translators
Translation has, of course, long been at risk of automation. However, the advent of large language models is making human translators increasingly vulnerable to replacement by AI. In a 2020 research paper, it was shown that a Transformer-based deep learning system outperforms human translators. This study is significant because it shows that AI translators are not just as good as, but often better than, human translators.advertisement
What’s more, the rise of AI translators is likely to have a negative effect on the wages of human translators. As AI translation becomes more common, the demand for human translators will decrease, and their wages will accordingly drop. While many economists once worried about the impact of outsourcing on the white-collar workforce, the coming wave of AI will have an even more serious impact, across sectors.
In fact, as Forbes reports, AI job automation has already been the primary driver in U.S. income inequality over the past 40 years.
Robo-coders
Just over a year ago, an OpenAI beta tester posited that AI may one day replace many coder jobs. At the time, OpenAI hadn’t yet released its code-generation engine, Codex, which now allows AI to autonomously write code in multiple languages. While the Codex of today is fairly primitive, one doesn’t need to be a futurist to see how this technology could be used to automate away many coder jobs in the future. As AI gets better at understanding code and writing it, it will soon come to match and ultimately exceed human skill levels.
The implications of AI job automationadvertisement
Just two years ago, the idea of AI automating jobs like creative roles was the stuff of science fiction or at least relegated to a few early-adopting businesses. But now, AI is becoming table stakes for many businesses. In other words, if you’re not using AI, you’re at a disadvantage. The major reason for this is that large language model, primarily OpenAI’s GPT-3, have become much better at understanding natural language.
The examples given so far are just the tip of the iceberg. AI is automating jobs away in virtually every sector and industry. While this might seem like cause for alarm, it’s actually long overdue news. The fact is, we’ve been living in a world where machines have been slowly replacing human workers for centuries.
What’s new is the pace of this automation. Machines are now becoming faster, better, and cheaper than humans at an alarming rate. As a result, we’re seeing a fundamental shift in the economy where machines are starting to do the creative jobs of human beings.
Amidst the opportunity to automate away jobs, a new wave of AI-focused startups has emerged, all seeking to cash in on the potential of AI. This AI gold rush is evidenced by the billions of dollars in venture funding that has flowed into AI startups in recent months. In the third quarter of 2021 alone, nearly $18 billion was invested in AI companies, a record high.
This influx of capital is a sign that investors believe in the potential of AI, and they are betting that it will eventually automate away many jobs, generating that value with machines instead. In the meantime, we should prepare ourselves for a future in which AI is quietly eating up the world’s workforce.

ImagenAI Review: Is Bulk Artificial Intelligence Editing Finally Here?





Jan 11, 2022





David Crewe






































 ImagenAI is a personalized photo editing assistant that is designed to learn individual photographer’s styles using artificial intelligence (AI) to help make applying bulk edits to entire catalogs quick and easy. So, does it work, and are we about to enter into a new age of AI editing?         Given that many photographers have reported an upswing in weddings and events again, it is worth checking in to see just how good these AI editing applications have gotten, and if this particular one is worth the investment.  It is probably safe to say that sitting in front of the computer part is the least favored task of most photographers. It is also by far the least glamorous since every hour spent behind the lens averages to four or more in front of the screen culling, editing, cropping, and fine-tuning. While this isn’t such a bad gig during the winter and off-season, spending too much time on editing can seriously eat away at the valuable time working with additional clients during peak seasons. So with the potential of new work and clients, it is time to look into ways to save us time spent in front of the computer dealing with post-processing all those images.

Continue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE What Does ImagenAI Do? ImagenAI is an AI-powered desktop app for Mac or PC that was developed by programmer Yoav Chai after he was waiting (too long, as he says) for his own wedding images to be delivered. The ultimate goal of the tool he built was to simply make it easier and faster for photographers to get bulk edits of their images completed, thus freeing them up to move on to other projects, and more importantly, delivering the completed images to their clients.   The software is built to work seamlessly with Adobe Lightroom Classic and learn the way a specific photographer edits to create an independent style that will be automatically applied to any files uploaded through the application. The company says the algorithm learns each user’s editing style by reviewing several catalogs worth of edited images (5,000 or more images for the best results) to build this unique profile, and it keeps learning as a photographer continues to use the app by tweaking any edits sent back by the services and reuploading them for further training. 




 Once a user has trained the system in their preferred style, they can then apply it to their own images at the same time as still granting the ability to add options like cropping and straightening. Depending on the connection speed for the upload, the system takes an average of about 20 minutes to edit 1,000 images, at which point it will send the edits back to be imported by the user.  As a note, this will be slower depending on how many users are tasking the ImagenAI system at the same time, which has me questioning the feasibility of future scalability.  In addition to learning each individual’s personal style for the work, users also have the option to select from “Talents” that ImagenAI works with, which are photographers who have shared their distinct styles. You can think of these Talents pretty much like an automatic preset pack for Lightroom.  Like other bulk editing services, it will not always get everything exactly right, but it can help save hours of editing time per shoot by providing a baseline starting point to work from. The application targets photographers who work in the wedding, product, real estate, and events markets, but can certainly benefit other disciplines. The application supports adjustments to all of the “Basics” sliders like exposure, white balance, contrast, vibrance, and texture. Additionally, the service can also make adjustments to the hue/saturation/luminance sliders as well as the sharpening and noise reduction tools. This level of granularity will theoretically leave you with a broad starting point with only the micro-adjustments left to be made with tools like spot healing, graduated filters, and so on.  The Workflow Process 




The steps have mostly been outlined above, and in practice I found the software to be gratefully as straightforward and simple as ImagenAi makes it sound.  After you install the application, the software uploads the baseline “learning” images to its server in order to train the AI on your specific style. Ideally, it will be easiest if these images are in a single catalog. After the AI trains itself, you are notified by an email that your personalized profile is ready and that you can upload your RAW files to be edited. ImagenAI will then process those images and notify you again via email when the project is ready for download once completed.  At that point, simply reopen the application and select the “Download and Update your Lightroom Catalog with edits” and select the desired project. This is when it is safe to reopen the actual Lightroom catalog to check out how the AI has done with the RAW files and make any additional adjustments before sending to your client or making further edits in another processing application like Photoshop.    Afterward, especially if you plan to continue using the service, the company recommends using the “Fine-tune” tool at the bottom of the application’s main window to re-upload the final, manually-edited images so that the system can better learn and enhance the accuracy of how it understands your particular style which the company says will make it faster and more accurate with each ensuing project.




But Does It Work? The short answer? Yes. Is it perfect? No.  With my training session, I sent the application a series of images ranging from a concert, a comic con, two modeling sessions, a few landscape images, some goofy photos of my dog, as well as a celebrity clothing line project. I did my best to give ImagenAI as many photos as I could, well more than the 5,000 photos it said would be a solid target, as a baseline for my personal Lightroom style. After a few hours, the system emailed me to let me know the learning was done, and I was ready to start processing images.  To make things interesting, I created a new catalog full of random images from several different events including shooting behind the scenes for an upcoming film, a different comic con, and a smattering of portraits and landscape images just to see how the app would react. This particular upload consisted of just over 800 images and took just about two hours to upload, process, and return to me.  What I got back was honestly quite impressive. The convention and behind-the-scenes images were shot under some pretty challenging lighting situations not to mention the bevy of non-linear angles and perspectives, but the system learned my style pretty quickly and accurately. I honestly couldn’t have been happier with what came back in this case, unless the app culled them down for me also (I’ll keep my fingers crossed that becomes a feature someday, or at least a grouping and ranking system of some sort to help speed up the fat-trimming). For a majority of the photos, it almost felt like I hit an “auto” button for the settings but with the added benefit of a personal touch. I did notice that in the portrait files, the colors were a little more muted than I would have preferred, but I imagine that would improve with each similar and ensuing file I re-upload to the system which would further train the AI. 




 For those who want to try this, I advise photographers who do more than one style of work to create multiple “profiles” within the application. In my case where I hit the AI with a smattering of very different types of photos, what came out worked great for one style but less so for another.   Granted, I only was able to test the application out using a small sample set of images, but it feels a little more accurate than some other previous services I have outsourced to in the past, and definitely much faster. I haven’t even continued to train the AI and I’m already impressed.   For my own personal work, I could see this being useful on-site for large corporate events at situations like comic conventions, fashion events, trade shows, concerts, and possibly even product and food photography. I don’t personally shoot weddings anymore, but I feel like from a dollars-per-image perspective, that would be one of the best use cases for ImagenAI as well.




What It Can’t Do While I was impressed with the application and the results it returned, that does not mean it is without issue. The first thing I noticed (and I touched on this above) is that the application does not rank/rate/group or cull the images down. While it can apply your style and level out the images (if required), it still will leave in the out of focus, lower quality, misfired, and so on photos. Yes, it saves a ton of time “editing,” but users will still be left with the task of culling the images down themselves. Perhaps this is not such a big deal in the behind-the-scenes and events market, but you definitely do not want to deliver the “bad” shots to a wedding or portrait client and because of that, photographers will still have to spend the time to reject images.  The application also cannot identify and pick out images where you would apply your “signature style” like black and white or more customized edits. Again, it might be possible to train a separate profile for things like monochrome or other stylized looks, but users will have to apply that profile to an entire upload. Unless you are incredibly organized and have already culled and sorted the images out into separate folders and categories, it will be pretty tedious to do this task even with ImagenAI’s tools helping the process. The reality is, custom and detailed edits for the “printable” images will still need to be manually chosen and worked on. This is not really a deal-breaker by any means, but worth noting to make sure readers are aware before diving into the app.  The last thing worth noting about the limitations of ImagenAI is it is currently built entirely on the Adobe Lightroom architecture. This means that any photographers using other RAW processing engines in their workflows like Capture One Pro, or even Photo Mechanic will have to use Lightroom Classic to be able to benefit from this service. AI Editing is Here ImagenAI seems to learn each photographer’s editing style from Lightroom at an impressive speed, making it much easier and faster to churn through excessive image catalogs and it will only get better each time a user adds to their catalogs with the application. As a bonus, the software offers users 1,000 edited images for free before you have to subscribe, so you can see if the platform will work for you without having to lay down a cent.   The ImagenAI platform is available to both PC and Mac users for $7 per month as part of a subscription plan, plus a per-image fee of $0.04 to $0.06 per image based on the number of images in a batch. The scale slides from $0.06 per photo at 1 to 1,000 images, $0.05 per photo at 1,001 to 5,000 images, and $0.04 per photo from 5,001 to 10,000 and more . The structure may seem a bit strange, but the $7 monthly fee gets put up against the monthly final bill for any images uploaded and edited which means it is not just a fee for access, it actually counts towards each users images and carries over if it doesn’t get used at the end of the month. 




ImagenAI allows you to cancel your memberships at any time without any penalties or additional fees as well, which is nice. If a photographer is shooting a lot of bulk images, ImagenAI’s somewhat convoluted pricing tiers do end up saving you money and time, especially when compared to a digital tech or editor for those who might want to use it on site. Others may just like the service because it saves time being stuck at your desk, even if the lack of culling capability does mean it doesn’t remove this step entirely.  After doing the math on a recent gig I worked personally where an editor was hired, I found that this app could have done the job faster and cheaper. This will obviously not always be the case, but it is definitely worth having around as a tool to have in those clutch situations. Are There Alternatives? There is definitely no shortage of outsourced image editing platforms and software on the market. One of the first to consider is ShootDotEdit, which is one of the premier wedding photography outsourcing sites. However, this particular business uses actual retouchers and has a turn-around average of five business days. Under the same umbrella is a service called Weddit which offers a similar service and turnaround time, and again, is focused almost entirely on the wedding business.  On the AI front and for a more broad coverage of genres, there are apps like Autoretouch and RetouchPro.AI, but both seem to cost a fair bit more than ImagenAI. Should You Buy It? Yes, if you are a creative that shoots a lot of high-quantity image events like weddings, trade shows, concerts, and conventions. ImagenAI is worth the investment for at least a single project and will likely only grow in its reliability over time.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
The tech world is abuzz with murmurs of the fabled 10x developer, but whether such a developer really exists is up for debate.




Have you ever heard of a 10x programmer? If you’re not in the tech world, the answer is probably no, and even if you are in some way associated with the world of coding and technology, and you might not really be familiar with this term. But within the developer community, it's become a shorthand way to talk about the skill sets that people have, and how they use them to be competitive.
Some people refer to the 10x programmer as a piece of IT ""folklore."" And in fact, the idea of it is very mythological on its face. A 10x programmer is a programmer or developer who is as productive as ten other average people in his or her field. So that very description, that idea conjures up a somewhat mythological figure, a “king geek” super-programmer with lightning-fast fingers and a great big brain.
With that said, there's a lot of debate about whether 10x programmers exist. Can someone be ten times as good as someone else in these kinds of disciplines?
Where's the Proof? The Case Against 10x Programmers
A big part of the argument of people who don't believe in 10x programmers relates to a lack of research showing these sorts of productivity disparities. Critics may contend that there is very sketchy research to support the 10x programmer idea, and that it really can't be measured in any meaningful way. For example, in this Fog Creek blog, tech expert Laurent Bossavit talks about how research on 10x programmers was only done on small groups, that a lot of the research was old, and that it used rather obsolete types of coding languages. Bossavit also talks about unknowns such as how relevant prior science would be today, and how well you can really measure programming or development capacity.
It’s an Intuitive Thing
In firing back, those who do think that 10x programmers are out there often talk about the same complexity inherent in the field to suggest that there should theoretically be people who are ten times more productive than the average.
For instance, take a look at this rather eloquent defense of the 10x programmer by Yevgeniy Brikman entitled “The 10x Developer is Not a Myth.” Here, Brikman cites someone like William Shakespeare – we can't really measure why Shakespeare was so much better than other writers of his time, but the “proof” is evident in schools and universities, on bookshelves and in libraries.Advertisements




Brikman also talks about programming and development as being based on design choices. For instance, he mentions the utility of Ruby over C for various projects. The idea that he puts forward is that by making better choices, a programmer can indeed do the work of ten people and work ten times more productively than someone else. These sorts of arguments keep the hope alive that a company could see one of these modern-day giants striding into its offices on any given day. (For more on groundbreaking tech development, see The Pioneers of Computer Programming.)
Back and Forth
For a lot more on the idea of 10x programmers, you don’t have to look any further than Quora, a social media community based precisely on answering such thorny questions.
One Quora thread (among some dozen targeted to the issue) asks about whether there are actually 100x or 1000x engineers. Some extend the reasoning for 10x programmers or engineers logically to say that in fact, some people really do add a lot more value to a project than others. However, in this thread and others, the question often comes down to what your yardstick looks like, and how you actually assign value.
Another Quora thread is possibly more helpful: it asks why 10x people are not paid ten times more than other professionals. One of the answers that you get is that these ""unicorns"" of the development world often go on to start their own companies, rather than slaving away for someone. If you accept the premise that the creative products of startups like YouTube and Dropbox are 1000 times more valuable than the salary of someone at, say, Google, then you could make a lot of the same arguments for saying that these entrepreneurs, these people who broke out of the box to create new products, were at least 100 times or even 1000 times more productive than others in their field – but you see the kind of complex logic here. It sort of breaks down, because a startup isn't like a big company, and we don't really measure people’s value just by how much money they make… or at least, it’s frowned upon in polite society.
In the end, all of this is very instructive in talking about the ways that the industry works, and the way that it compensates its people. On a very basic level, you could say that the most skilled people end up working for themselves, or that they start to command a lot of attention at larger companies, because after a while, other people start realizing how good they are at what they do. But all of this isn't to take away from anyone else who may be a little more ""average."" After all, while some of our biggest tech offerings are the brainchild of one or two people, you don’t really get anywhere in a society like this without some collaboration and group work – even if you're Steve Jobs or Bill Gates.
From a practical standpoint, companies would be well served by not worrying about finding 10x programmers, but instead putting that energy into creating productive and intelligent teams, empowering their workers to grow within the company, and unleashing each person’s inner productivity. But for those who want to engage in hero worship and chase the dream of the mythological uber-programmer, it's possible that those mega-stars might be out there. They might just be applying all of their potential to the next Facebook or iPhone. (To help prepare for your next interview, see The Craziest Tech Interview Questions – and What They Might Mean.)
