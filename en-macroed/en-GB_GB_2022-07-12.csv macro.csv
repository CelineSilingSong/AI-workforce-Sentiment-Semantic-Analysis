Photograph: dima_sidelnikov/Getty Images/iStockphotoArtificial intelligence (AI) This article is more than 2 years oldUK data watchdog investigates whether AI systems show racial bias This article is more than 2 years oldICO says AI-driven discrimination can lead to job rejections or being wrongfully denied bank loans or benefitDan Milmo Global technology editorThu 14 Jul 2022 01.01 EDTShareThe UK data watchdog is to investigate whether artificial intelligence systems are showing racial bias when dealing with job applications.The Information Commissioner’s Office said AI-driven discrimination could have “damaging consequences for people’s lives” and lead to someone being rejected for a job or being wrongfully denied a bank loan or a welfare benefit.It will investigate the use of algorithms to sift through job applications, amid concerns that they are affecting employment opportunities for people from ethnic minorities.“We will be investigating concerns over the use of algorithms to sift recruitment applications, which could be negatively impacting employment opportunities of those from diverse backgrounds,” said the ICO.The investigation is being announced as part of a three-year plan for the ICO under the UK’s new information commissioner, John Edwards, who joined the ICO in January after running its New Zealand counterpart.In a speech on Thursday Edwards is expected to say that the ICO will be “looking at the impact AI use could be having on groups of people who aren’t part of the testing for this software, such as neurodiverse people or people from ethnic minorities”.The CEO of ZipRecruiter, a jobs website, told the Guardian this year at least three-quarters of all CVs submitted for jobs in the US are read by algorithms. A survey of recruiting executives conducted by the research and consulting firm Gartner last year found that almost all reported using AI for part of the recruiting and hiring process – for instance sifting applications before they are seen by a person.Under the UK General Data Protection Regulation, which is enforced by the ICO, people have a right to non-discrimination under the processing of their data. The ICO has warned in the past that AI-driven systems could produce outcomes that disadvantage certain groups if they are not represented accurately or fairly in the data set that the algorithm is trained and tested on. The UK Equality Act 2010, also offers individuals protection from discrimination, whether caused by a human or an automated decision-making system.Dr David Leslie, director of ethics and responsible innovation research at The Alan Turing Institute, said: “The use of data-driven AI models in recruitment processes raises a host of thorny ethical issues, which demand forethought and diligent assessment on the part of both system designers and procurers.“Most basically, predictive models that could be used to filter job applications through techniques of supervised machine learning run the risk of replicating, or even augmenting, patterns of discrimination and structural inequities that could be baked into the datasets used to train them.”Elsewhere in its three-year plan, the UK watchdog will look at whether to prioritise the public interest when considering complaints about freedom of information requests. The ICO said changes to the complaints process for the FoI regime – which grants members of the public the legal right to request official information from public bodies – are necessary due to rising complaints and fewer resources to deal with them.Edwards said the current system for dealing with FoI complaints – for reasons that include late responses or incomplete information disclosures – was not working and it would consult on a new regime. The number of complaints reached 6,361 in the year to 30 April 2022, which was a slight dip on the prior year but compares with 5,433 in 2016/17.“I want to explore whether we should be able to elevate some cases or pull some out and say: this goes on a fast track, because it’s in the public interest,” said Edwards.Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BSTEdwards said the organisation expected to avoid accusations of bias in what it prioritised by publishing a list of criteria for sifting through complaints.Edwards said the ICO would consider prioritising submissions from journalists and MPs, although it would also weigh a “blind applicant” system where the identity of the person or organisation making the submission was concealed. Information held by Scottish public authorities is covered by the country’s own commissioner and Freedom of Information Act.“Should we differentiate between who’s making the request … and say a journalist is acting on behalf of the wider public to illuminate a particular issue. So therefore, they get extra points. A member of parliament, for example, has a very particular role in holding the executive and public authorities to account so maybe there’s a case for adding extra weight to those [requests].”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingDiscrimination at workWork & careersRaceInformation commissionerData protectionnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedIsrael shaken as fatal Houthi drone hits Tel Aviv after interception failureLiveThird Democratic US senator and four more House Democrats call for Biden to step aside in 2024 race– liveDance, spend time in nature, and get naked! 17 body confidence tips from people who have itLiveWindows IT outage live: CrowdStrike CEO ‘deeply sorry’ for global chaos caused by update and warns fix may take time to work‘Largest IT outage in history’ hits Microsoft Windows and causes global chaos",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Employers are turning to artificial intelligence to identify fraudulent job candidates as remote hiring and a labor shortage fuel a rise in opportunities for dishonesty on the part of applicants. Deception takes new forms in the era of remote recruitment: Some prospective hires have been known to receive interview answers from someone off camera in the Zoom room and mouth along a la Cyrano de Bergerac. Others exploit remote assessments by getting another person to take their cognitive or coding tests for them. And others do a bait and switch, where the person who interviews and is hired is not the same one who shows up for the job.

This fraud creates a frustrating — not to mention expensive — problem for companies. They not only spend money recruiting new candidates but also face costs related to the lost productivity associated with onboarding workers who don't have the qualifications they claim to, and that strains team morale. There are also security concerns. The FBI recently issued a public service announcement warning companies of the increased risk of people with criminal records applying for work-from-home tech jobs that allow them to gain access to confidential company and customer data.A recent study by Glider AI, a recruiting-software company, found candidate fraud has nearly doubled since the pandemic began. Executives there estimated about 10% of prospective hires attempted to commit some form of fraud.

Cameron Edwards, the senior vice president of client strategy and operations at Matlen Silver, a staffing agency that screens applicants for jobs at Fortune 500 companies, said the phenomenon was happening across industries and roles but that it's most common in technical, IT, and developer jobs.""There've always been people who fluff their résumés, but more and more, we're dealing with people who are just plain not who they say they are,"" Edwards told Insider. ""There was once somebody hiding beneath the desk answering interview questions for a candidate — you could even see the top of the person's head. But there are other instances of fraud that are hard to catch.""For those, employers rely on tools that help them recognize when a job seeker is trying to cheat the hiring process. Staying ahead of unscrupulous tactics isn't easy — particularly as technology advances at a rapid pace and a tight labor market puts pressure on companies to hire quickly. But at a time when remote recruiting has become more common, a growing number of companies are determined to take action.Remote hiring is a ripe opportunity for fraudulent candidatesCandidates lying in interviews or fudging skills to get a job are nothing new, of course. A 2020 survey from Checkster, a reference-checking company, found that 78% of job candidates in its poll admitted they'd misrepresented themselves or would consider doing so.

But experts say that the practice has recently become more prevalent — and more nefarious — as previous social norms around work have weakened.""Everything we thought we knew about work has been called into question in the last two years,"" G. James Lemoine, a professor at the University at Buffalo's School of Management, said.

""People aren't staying with their employers as long, they're not going to offices, and in the age of the 'Great Resignation,' they're quitting more often,"" Lemoine said. ""So a lot of people start to think, 'What other rules can be broken?'""

The limitations of remote hiring are another factor, according to Lindsey Zuloaga, the chief data scientist at HireVue, a recruiting-technology firm. Before the pandemic, most candidates went to an office to interview with a hiring manager, or took an assessment proctored by a human.

""If you were hiring in person, the candidate would be coding in front of you on a whiteboard, and when they showed up for work, you'd know it was the right person because you'd already met them,"" she said. ""It was a lot harder to pull off these tricks.""The talent shortage has exacerbated the problem, Ben Walker, the vice president of operations at Glider AI, added.""Companies cannot hire enough tech talent, and so they're having to screen people faster,"" he said. ""This makes it harder for them to know whether candidates can do what they say they can, and so more are slipping through the cracks.""How AI identifies fraudulent candidatesArtificial intelligence is a standard component of today's hiring process. According to the Society for Human Resource Management, 88% of companies globally use AI in some way for HR.

Using AI-powered tools to find fraudulent candidates is a natural next step in the evolution of hiring, employers say. Some tools, for instance, can detect cheating and plagiarism in technical assessments by identifying questionable patterns of behavior, including whether candidates are using their phones and whether they're using multiple screens. Other capabilities can detect outside voices during an interview that would otherwise be barely perceptible to a remote interviewer. Some can also detect whether there are other people in the room by analyzing the test area and detecting whether a remote desktop is being used.The tools raise flags that alert human hiring managers to look more closely at a candidate's behavior or examine code similarities with published sources.""With AI, we can find out when a candidate is pulling up a page on their browser to cut and paste answers from the internet on a coding challenge or when their microphone is being accessed by someone else remotely during an interview,"" Edwards of Matlen Silver said. ""Since using these tools, we've been able to catch far more instances of fraud that we otherwise wouldn't have had visibility into.""Vik Kalra, a cofounder of Mindlance, a staffing firm focused on placing highly skilled contractors at Fortune 1000 companies, said he started using AI-enabled tools just before COVID-19 hit. He was initially motivated out of concern about human biases in the interviewing process and a desire for more objective data on a candidate's abilities.

But since the pandemic started, he relies on AI to catch cheating candidates as well. Recruiting has always involved a mix of art and science, he said.""Interviewing is about intuition and common sense combined with open-ended questions and other tests designed to assess how a candidate stacks up,"" he said. Nowadays, he leans more on the science. ""I need to validate that there's no fraud going on and also that the candidate is the best person for the job,"" he said.Kalra said the greatest utility for his company was the facial-recognition technology that verifies the identity of candidates — and that they were indeed the same people who were interviewed and took assessments — before they're hired. Roughly 75% of candidates that have passed his company's hiring process, which includes the Glider AI assessment, are selected by his clients. Before using the AI tool, that figure hovered around 30%.

Of course, AI cannot detect every instance of candidate fraud. Bad actors are increasingly sophisticated and able to find ways to outsmart the technologies.Critics also say that an overreliance on AI- and machine-learning-powered tools in hiring can become a problem. Some lawmakers have called for closer scrutiny of the use of AI in evaluating job candidates. They say racial or gender stereotypes hidden in data sets and algorithms could pick up on human biases. This is especially the case in fields like tech, where progress toward diversity remains slow.As a result, leaders of AI platforms are often quick to emphasize the need to blend technology with human judgment.""The pace of change in candidate fraud is such that to be successful means combining the right tools with the best people,"" said Danny Jones, a product manager at Dice, a tech-recruiting platform. ""For every automated process or AI model we employ, there is a human behind the scenes.""

Executives there estimated about 10% of prospective hires attempted to commit some form of fraud. Cameron Edwards, the senior vice president of client strategy and operations at Matlen Silver, a staffing agency that screens applicants for jobs at Fortune 500 companies, said the phenomenon was happening across industries and roles but that it's most common in technical, IT, and developer jobs.""There've always been people who fluff their résumés, but more and more, we're dealing with people who are just plain not who they say they are,"" Edwards told Insider. ""There was once somebody hiding beneath the desk answering interview questions for a candidate — you could even see the top of the person's head. But there are other instances of fraud that are hard to catch.""For those, employers rely on tools that help them recognize when a job seeker is trying to cheat the hiring process. Staying ahead of unscrupulous tactics isn't easy — particularly as technology advances at a rapid pace and a tight labor market puts pressure on companies to hire quickly. But at a time when remote recruiting has become more common, a growing number of companies are determined to take action.Candidates lying in interviews or fudging skills to get a job are nothing new, of course. A 2020 survey from Checkster, a reference-checking company, found that 78% of job candidates in its poll admitted they'd misrepresented themselves or would consider doing so.But experts say that the practice has recently become more prevalent — and more nefarious — as previous social norms around work have weakened.""Everything we thought we knew about work has been called into question in the last two years,"" G. James Lemoine, a professor at the University at Buffalo's School of Management, said. ""People aren't staying with their employers as long, they're not going to offices, and in the age of the 'Great Resignation,' they're quitting more often,"" Lemoine said. ""So a lot of people start to think, 'What other rules can be broken?'""The limitations of remote hiring are another factor, according to Lindsey Zuloaga, the chief data scientist at HireVue, a recruiting-technology firm. Before the pandemic, most candidates went to an office to interview with a hiring manager, or took an assessment proctored by a human.""If you were hiring in person, the candidate would be coding in front of you on a whiteboard, and when they showed up for work, you'd know it was the right person because you'd already met them,"" she said. ""It was a lot harder to pull off these tricks.""The talent shortage has exacerbated the problem, Ben Walker, the vice president of operations at Glider AI, added.""Companies cannot hire enough tech talent, and so they're having to screen people faster,"" he said. ""This makes it harder for them to know whether candidates can do what they say they can, and so more are slipping through the cracks.""Artificial intelligence is a standard component of today's hiring process. According to the Society for Human Resource Management, 88% of companies globally use AI in some way for HR.Using AI-powered tools to find fraudulent candidates is a natural next step in the evolution of hiring, employers say. Some tools, for instance, can detect cheating and plagiarism in technical assessments by identifying questionable patterns of behavior, including whether candidates are using their phones and whether they're using multiple screens. Other capabilities can detect outside voices during an interview that would otherwise be barely perceptible to a remote interviewer. Some can also detect whether there are other people in the room by analyzing the test area and detecting whether a remote desktop is being used.The tools raise flags that alert human hiring managers to look more closely at a candidate's behavior or examine code similarities with published sources.""With AI, we can find out when a candidate is pulling up a page on their browser to cut and paste answers from the internet on a coding challenge or when their microphone is being accessed by someone else remotely during an interview,"" Edwards of Matlen Silver said. ""Since using these tools, we've been able to catch far more instances of fraud that we otherwise wouldn't have had visibility into.""Vik Kalra, a cofounder of Mindlance, a staffing firm focused on placing highly skilled contractors at Fortune 1000 companies, said he started using AI-enabled tools just before COVID-19 hit. He was initially motivated out of concern about human biases in the interviewing process and a desire for more objective data on a candidate's abilities. But since the pandemic started, he relies on AI to catch cheating candidates as well. Recruiting has always involved a mix of art and science, he said.""Interviewing is about intuition and common sense combined with open-ended questions and other tests designed to assess how a candidate stacks up,"" he said. Nowadays, he leans more on the science. ""I need to validate that there's no fraud going on and also that the candidate is the best person for the job,"" he said.Kalra said the greatest utility for his company was the facial-recognition technology that verifies the identity of candidates — and that they were indeed the same people who were interviewed and took assessments — before they're hired. Roughly 75% of candidates that have passed his company's hiring process, which includes the Glider AI assessment, are selected by his clients. Before using the AI tool, that figure hovered around 30%.Of course, AI cannot detect every instance of candidate fraud. Bad actors are increasingly sophisticated and able to find ways to outsmart the technologies.Critics also say that an overreliance on AI- and machine-learning-powered tools in hiring can become a problem. Some lawmakers have called for closer scrutiny of the use of AI in evaluating job candidates. They say racial or gender stereotypes hidden in data sets and algorithms could pick up on human biases. This is especially the case in fields like tech, where progress toward diversity remains slow.As a result, leaders of AI platforms are often quick to emphasize the need to blend technology with human judgment.""The pace of change in candidate fraud is such that to be successful means combining the right tools with the best people,"" said Danny Jones, a product manager at Dice, a tech-recruiting platform. ""For every automated process or AI model we employ, there is a human behind the scenes.""","Careers, Nordic, Strategy",False,"[{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': False, 'cssSelector': '.content-lock-content'}]","[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/', 'name': 'Business Insider'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/careers', 'name': 'Careers'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/prime', 'name': 'BI Prime'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 4, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/how-ai-can-catch-fraudulent-cheating-job-candidates-in-tech-2022-6', 'name': 'More job candidates are lying and cheating in their interviews.

These engineers also create weak or strong AIs, depending on what goals they want to achieve. AI engineers have a sound understanding of programming, software engineering, and data science. They use different tools and techniques so they can process data, as well as develop and maintain AI systems..The discipline of AI engineering is still relatively new, but it has the potential to open up a wealth of employment doors in the years to come. A bachelor's degree in a relevant subject, such as information technology, computer engineering, statistics, or data science, is the very minimum need for entry into the area of artificial intelligence engineering. As an AI engineer, you need to perform certain tasks, such as developing, testing, and deploying AI models through programming algorithms like random forest, logistic regression, linear regression, and so on. However, Self-teaching is also another great way to hone skills in AI engineering..FAANG is a group of big tech companies including Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google. It is every techie's dream to join different professions and roles. A job in FAANG is a dream come true for almost all working professionals from any technical field. But there is a discrepancy between a self-taught AI engineer and a pro with a degree in AI. Multiple companies prefer to hire an AI engineer with a valid degree from eminent educational institutions and platforms. However, big tech companies such as Facebook, IBM, Google, and Apple are welcoming self-taught AI engineers without any past prejudices. Getting into FAANG requires a good understanding of data structures and algorithms and also an innovative mind when it comes to artificial intelligence. Companies like Google, Facebook, and Apple can ask you notorious questions and therefore you need to brush your skills a bit in this area before going to the interview..Understanding how things work is as important as knowing how to code. Knowing how people think and behave in certain scenarios is handy when building products. The employer needs you to understand the flow of things or why a product has been designed the way it is. To make it to FAANG, you need to learn behavioral and systems design. If you have not attended any educational institution to receive a valuable programmer degree, you do not need to worry. The modern global tech market is updating and this current market version is set to hire employees without any professional degree. FAANG is a group of tech influencers in the global tech market. All other companies seem to follow their policies and artificial intelligence models to enhance customer engagement efficiently and effectively. A job in the FAANG group also provides a competitive edge to an employee to kickstart a successful career journey. Thus, whether an employee is a self-taught programmer or a self-taught data science pro, one can seamlessly apply for a job in FAANG with full confidence. FAANG seems to be highly interested in necessary skills, in-depth knowledge, and sufficient hands-on experience in the respective fields. They do not need a cybersecurity degree to select an employee. These big tech companies have relaxed their educational requirements policy to boost the productivity of their respective companies..More Trending Stories .Dogecoin is Trading 78,000% Above its All-Time Lows Amidst the Crypto BloodbathRegulators Scrutinize Voyager's Backside Dealings Using Investors' MoneyOnly AI Characters can turn Metaverse Ghost Towns into Virtual HotspotsRobots in a Human Workspace Are Dangerous, Amazon Warehouse Is the ExampleGitHub's Copilot is Not Democratic but Big Tech is Playing DumbArtificial Intelligence 100: Top Industry Wise Companies ListingFlawed AI Makes Sexist Robots and Researchers Are Okay with It.Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

Motive (formerly KeepTruckin), a well-funded US-based startup with a sizable team based out of Pakistan, is organising a two-day artificial intelligence (AI) conference titled ""AI Connect"" in Lahore from Wednesday aimed at ""showcasing Pakistan's talent"" in the artificial intelligence.
Ali Hasan, the startup's engineering manager, said the event will be ""replete with keynotes, fireside chats, panel discussions, and networking sessions with the world's top AI researchers, engineers, and entrepreneurs.""
The event, he continued, was designed to ""motivate, train, and connect"" the next generation of prospective AI engineers and researchers who were going to contribute significantly to the global AI economy.
Hasan said many countries had developed dedicated AI frameworks and policies to facilitate education programs and research and development centres to forward technological advancements and economic growth. 

""Examples include China's Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan, the US executive order on AI leadership, and AI Made in Germany — to name only a few.""
He emphasised that Pakistan must follow suit and invest in programmes to promote youths’ enthusiasm about AI and modern technologies. This means investing in education programmes, research centers, and industry readiness training programs, the engineer added.
Hasan said it had been an exception because ""it established its primary AI team in Lahore. This team consists of multiple PhDs, postdocs in computer vision and machine learning, and engineers with a solid academic research background.""
The team builds AI technologies to help prevent road accidents, keep our roads safer, and save lives. They have already shipped industry-leading AI products, published their work at top AI conferences, and filed multiple patents thanks to R&D done primarily in Pakistan, he highlighted.
According to Hasan, the engineers are deploying their solutions to hundreds of thousands of IoT devices in the field to perform various automation tasks, such as identifying who is driving the vehicle, detecting unsafe driving behaviors, and automated driver coaching, to name a few. 
""AI — and innovation in general — is not something new to Pakistan. We have a strong talent pool and a growing population of educated youth. We are also an incredible engineering hub with a growing Information Technology (IT) industry. We have over 600,000 IT professionals, with over 25,000 fresh graduates added to the workforce annually,"" the manager pointed out.
He said Pakistan had around 17,000 software companies providing services to over 120 countries across the globe, bringing in $3 billion in IT export revenue last year.
It is encouraging to look at the tech companies, startups, and research labs working in both applied and scientific research in artificial intelligence, but the number of companies and startups providing services and building products in the AI space is relatively small, Hasan added.
He insisted on investing in programmes that help bridge the industry-academia gap and motivate the youth to pursue research and education in AI. ""We must train some of our existing 600k IT professionals in AI, and we must create more centers like  National Center of Artificial Intelligence."" 
The firm NCAI, he went on, was a technological initiative established by the Government of Pakistan in 2018. ""It aims to become a leading hub of innovation, scientific research, knowledge transfer to the local economy, and training in the area of AI and its closely affiliated fields. It consists of nine research labs from six universities in Pakistan.""
In addition, Hasan said, a few more labs at the institutes including the National University of Sciences and Technology, and the Lahore University of Management Sciences were solving fundamental AI problems. ""They publish their work at top-tier international venues and collaborate with companies like Google and Facebook.""

The Indian Air Force (IAF) has established a Center of Excellence (CoE) for the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into its warfighting capabilities, becoming the first among the three armed services of India.

On July 10, Vice Chief of the Air Staff (VCAS), Air Marshal Sandeep Singh, inaugurated the IAF’s Centre of Excellence for Artificial Intelligence under the aegis of UDAAN (Unit for Digitisation, Automation, Artificial Intelligence, and Application Networking) at Air Force Station Rajokri, New Delhi.
“A Big Data Analytics and Al Platform have been commissioned in the IAF’s Al Centre, for handling all aspects of Analytics, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Neural Networks, and Deep Learning algorithms,” said the IAF in a press release.
The latest Graphical Processing Unit-powered servers will be used to undertake these high-end computer applications, per the IAF’s statement.

While addressing the gathering at the inaugural ceremony, Air Marshal Singh said that the IAF had taken proactive steps to incorporate Industry 4.0 and AI-based technologies in its warfighting processes.
“The AI COE with high-end compute and big data storage capabilities, coupled with full-spectrum Al software suites, would substantially enhance the operational capability of IAF,” Air Marshal Singh said.
Singh further said that the Al-based applications are being developed with in-house expertise in coordination with various Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs), MSMEs, and leading academia in the field of Artificial intelligence.
Artificial Intelligence In Aerial Warfighting
In today’s day and age, information and the ability to process this information to arrive at decisions is paramount.








US Military’s ‘Most Secretive Craft’ Has Been ‘Flying Non-Stop’ For Over Two Years & Has No Plans To Land

This is true in military aviation, where fighter pilots operating high-speed combat aircraft can find themselves in a complex high-paced threat environment where multiple threats are coming in from various directions at high speed.
In such a situation, detecting, tracking, and engaging these threats is essential for fighter pilots to survive and carry out their missions. This is where Big Data and Machine Learning come in, as these technologies can process a lot of information very quickly to enhance the battlespace awareness of the pilots.

While Artificial Intelligence (AI) takes it to another level by taking over the decision-making task, thereby making the aircraft semi-autonomous to take some load off of pilots but not entirely replacing them, according to Aerospace and Defense Analyst Girish Linganna.
“In aerial combat, AI shall not replace human operators, but rather aid them; taking over simpler tasks and freeing the pilot’s headspace for more complex decision-making,” Linganna told EurAsian Times.
Linganna explained that AI algorithms automate various human tasks, but the complexity of functions comes into play and broadly defines the challenge at hand.



“For example, for a robot cleaning the floor, the algorithm will largely concern itself with looking where it’s going and cleaning. However, a task like guiding a fuel hose during aerial refueling would be a greater challenge, even for a human operator,” Linganna said.

When asked how exactly the AI enhances the capabilities of a fighter jet, Linganna said that an AI could work into this dynamic by either increasing capabilities as an add-on or by perfecting tasks often taken up by human operators.
“In aerial combat, we have two skilled players engaged in the most expensive game of chess,” Linganna explained, adding that the “key to victory is largely outmaneuvering and forcing errors.
He further added: “In the cockpit, the three-dimensionality of flight means going from a twenty-degree bank angle, ascending at ten degrees, to get to a thirty-degree bank angle, rising at twenty degrees, the way to move the stick will vary at different speeds. Such is only one of the many overheads in a dogfight.
AI can address many such overheads and simultaneously increase the Situational Awareness of the human pilot.

We have autonomous wingman programs like Defense Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)’s indigenous Combat Air Teaming System (CATS), which focuses on expanding the capabilities of each pilot in the air by increasing payloads at hand and also offering greater situational awareness.”
China Dominating Artificial Intelligence
Militaries worldwide constantly work to incorporate modern technologies into their warfighting, and AI is no exception.
The two superpowers, the US and China, are at the forefront of the ongoing race for AI supremacy since the militaries of both these countries view AI as a critical part of next-generation warfare.
In February, the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) solicited proposals for converting the existing F-16D aircraft into a testbed platform for AI-enabled dogfighting in realistic experiments.
The solicitation, part of DARPA’s Air Combat Evolution (ACE) program, asked for aircraft hardware and mission systems software for modifying and testing two F-16D aircraft to accept within-visual-range (WVR) autonomy algorithms.
The agency also asked the industry for solutions to measure, increase and predict human trust in combat autonomy performance.
The ACE program aims to enhance trust in combat autonomy through human-machine collaboration in aircraft dogfighting.

Likewise, China has been working to incorporate AI into warfighting by leveraging its booming drone industry.
In January, researchers from the China Aerodynamics Research and Development Centre in Mianyang, Sichuan province, claimed to have developed an AI-based system that can train unmanned combat drones to dogfight manned fighter jets thousands of times faster than comparable US technology.
This was not the first instance of China using AI to train combat drones for fighting manned fighter jets. In June 2021, the Chinese PLA Central Theater Command Air Force simulated a dogfight in which a highly experienced pilot was knocked down by an AI-enabled aircraft.
China is moving fast toward overtaking the US as a world leader in AI technology.
As recently reported by EurAsian Times, China’s core AI business is anticipated to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 24.8%, from 199.8 billion yuan ($29.89 billion) in 2021 to more than 600 billion yuan ($89.76 billion) in 2026.

Experts also suggest that China is surpassing the US in testing and incorporating AI into their military, especially the Air Force, and US government officials are concerned by this development.
“Certain people in the US government have forewarned Chinese global dominance in AI, especially in integration with the air force, if others do not wake up to the task,” Girish Linganna told EurAsian Times.
According to Linganna, China has already outpaced the US in testing AI against their air force squadrons. “Nearly 30% of Chinese military contracts involve AI and drones. However, their current focus remains on surveillance,” Linganna noted.
India Encourages Industry To Develop AI Technology
India also appears to be concerned by the burgeoning advances of the Chinese military in AI technology. Therefore the Indian government is encouraging research and development in this field.
On July 11, India’s Ministry of Defense (MoD) held the first-ever ‘AI in Defense’ (AIDef) symposium and exhibition, during which Defense Minister Rajnath Singh unveiled 75 new indigenously developed AI products/technologies.
These 75 products are a result of collective efforts made by the Armed Forces, DRDO, Defense Public Sector Undertakings (DPSUs), and several Indian start-ups under the government’s Innovations for Defense Excellence (iDEX) initiative and the private industry in the last four years in the field of AI.
“We have started incorporating AI applications in remote piloted, unmanned aerial vehicles, etc. There is a need to move further in this direction so that we can develop autonomous weapon systems. Timely infusion of technologies like AI & Big Data in the defense sector is of utmost importance so that we are not left behind the technological curve and can take maximum advantage of technology for our services,” Rajnath Singh said during the AIDef Symposium.

When asked how the Indian government intends to promote innovation and development of AI technologies within the industry, Linganna explained that the Indian approach has been to mobilize its public entities and leverage its players, as part of which the government has simplified many bureaucratic hurdles earlier involved in defense projects.
“It (India) has increasingly sought more innovation and is willing to use various platforms to fund multiple players in a controlled competition. It showcases a fertile environment for private players to take on risks while allowing the Indian government to steer the direction of this innovation,” Linganna said.

The professional work teams, which are expected to begin work in the coming months, will serve as the professional infrastructure for establishing the strategic dialogue on technology. The dialogue will significantly expand the strategic partnership in cutting edge technologies.The goal of this cooperation is to highlight the special relationship between the United States and Israel, anchor the partnership between the countries and cement Israel's status as one of the United States' leading allies in the field of technology, which is at the top of the international agenda. The work of the professional teams is an expression of both countries' commitment to addressing challenges by developing technological solutions as a basis for close cooperation that will shape the next decade.Minister of Innovation, Science and Technology Orit Farkash-Hacohen: ""I am so pleased that the president's visit will include a declaration from him about increased technological cooperation between the two governments, the result of work conducted in my ministry and the NSC over the past several months.

This is an important development that will leverage Israel's scientific power, its scientific community, local companies and the entire Israeli economy. It is a strategic infrastructure that will help maintain Israel's national resilience. Institutionalized scientific cooperation between our countries will contribute greatly to advancing science in Israel and exposing it to America's unique scientific infrastructure, in order to encourage innovation and scientific activities.""At times like these, when technology is at the forefront of the competition between cultures, countries and points of view, the correct buildup of Israel's technological strength, in cooperation with the United States — while leveraging Israel's scientific community, Israeli companies and Israel's economy — is a critical infrastructure for maintaining Israel's national resilience. Institutionalized scientific cooperation between our countries will contribute greatly to advancing science in Israel and exposing it to America's unique scientific infrastructure.

Artificial Intelligence leadership goes beyond technology
By Prof. Guido Stein, IESE Business School and Alberto Barrachina, Research Assistant
For companies, the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the fact that face-to-face is not always the best way to have meetings. Technological devices have made it possible to hold virtual meetings and to have it be the first option for many recruiters who are unaware of the candidate’s health risks and prefer to conduct the interview virtually. The use of tools to conduct video interviews and online assessments, assisted by artificial intelligence (AI) in decision-making, has increased exponentially. 
Digital interviews enable companies as well as candidates to have more opportunities. Candidates who would not have been interviewed without this tool can now be considered, and processes that were previously out of reach for many stakeholders can now be applied. On the other hand, AI lacks the keen eye and intuition of the human mind, and the wealth of information that it can provide. However, it also avoids possible biases and replaces them with a quantified objectivity with a scientific basis. 
As we will see later, with the help of technology it is possible to analyse tone of voice, word choice, content, eye contact, face configuration, information from multiple sources in their raw state, such as digital footprints on social media or, in the case of internal processes – and with the candidate’s permission – from internal communications such as emails.
Real jobs may be more or less affected by digitisation processes, but what we know for sure and in general is that there are management systems based on AI that cover all areas of Human Resources, from recruitment and selection to employee departures and dismissals. In a 2017 survey, it was already found that 15 per cent of Human Resources leaders surveyed in 40 countries said that AI and automation are already having an impact on their departments, and 40 per cent said they expected both to impact their plans in 2-5 years (Harvey Nash Survey, 2017). Three years later, automation has accelerated, along with other trends such as online purchasing of services and goods, remote working, the storage and analysis of large amounts of data, and redundancy in the management of tasks and the value chain (Candelon et al., 2020). AI is the next logical step in the evolution of companies, as it is useful for adapting to these changes.
Artificial Intelligence in Human Resources is Unstoppable
The classic areas of Human Resources are recruitment and selection, benefits and compensation, performance evaluation and estimation of potential, structure, career and job position design, labour relations, compliance, employee training and development, internal and external communication, analytics and metrics, and departures and dismissals. 
Although all of them have significant potential to be automated, many professionals with extensive experience have reservations when it comes to fully adopting new technologies. They put forth reasons such as the fact that some algorithms cannot be replaced by human empathy and intuition. Some have doubts about whether the data can really add anything new to what is already known about workforce dynamics, and they warn of biases due to the quality of the data, and even the quantity necessary to make it meaningful, without considering the legitimacy of its use. On the other side of the divide, there are those who are in favour of applying it for reasons such as the ability to automate repetitive tasks that have little added value, better talent acquisition, faster and more personalised employee onboarding, more efficient and effective training of employees, greater connectivity and technical support in decision-making.
The ability to automate repetitive, low-value tasks.
Examples of such tasks might be compensation and benefits administration, employee questions about procedures and policies, or resume review. To take the last of these, if a previously programmed algorithm is applied, a larger number of resumes can be analysed much more quickly and reliably, significantly reducing human error. The Human Resources team will have more time to provide a series of defined and continuously improving analysis criteria, or to increase the number of responses and interactions with candidates. Job applicants increasingly value getting information on the progress of their application, the time required for each phase of the process, and even the reason for not being selected (Talent Board, 2018).
Better talent acquisition. 
Automation makes it possible to compare the skills of candidates with the best-performing employees. On average, a company’s recruiter spends about a third of their work week identifying candidates (Entelo, 2018). In addition, the hiring process generates a large amount of data. If, for example, a company hires 100 workers per year and receives 1,000 applications, the 100 that were chosen and the 900 that were not can generate information about what the company needs and what the labour market can offer at the given moment. 
Faster, more personalised employee onboarding. 
AI systems can provide information about compensation, benefits, and company policies, as well as personalised suggestions for training and rapid integration into the team. In this way, the length of stay of the employee will improve, thanks to successful onboarding. 
More efficient and effective employee training. 
Along with training software, AI systems can provide personalised learning paths. The Human Resources department can implement chatbots that offer 24/7 training without interruptions, and with the ability to provide instant and logical responses. According to research by Zoom.ai (Chauhan, 2017), the most active users of automated assistants save up to 25 hours per month, averaging savings of €15,000 on an employee with a salary of €100,000 per year. 
Greater connectivity. 
As an example, connectivity between candidates, employees, and managers thanks to technology avoids travel and therefore saves both cost and time.
Cognitive support in decision-making. 
The main hiring phases are: design of the job description, opening of the application period, candidates applying, evaluation, and, where appropriate, interviewing of the candidate by the recruiter. All of these phases can be replaced by machines such as chatbots, automated screening tools, or other candidate interaction systems.
AI engines can help managers and employees make daily decisions that would otherwise fall on the HR department. For example, when an employee wants to have additional vacation days, the AI system can calculate the probability that their request will be approved or not, without having to consult Human Resources. 
In a survey conducted by Oracle among 484 Human Resources professionals (HR Research Institute, 2019), 64 per cent confirmed that AI has a high potential to improve the area of HR. In fact, it was the second most-selected Human Resources function after “analysis and metrics”. The main hiring phases are: design of the job description, opening of the application period, candidates applying, evaluation, and, where appropriate, interviewing of the candidate by the recruiter. All of these phases can be replaced by machines such as chatbots, automated screening tools, or other candidate interaction systems.
The Recruiter’s Perspective
A survey carried out in the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom in 2017, in which 5,179 managers were consulted, showed that only 10 per cent of workers were completely convinced that their jobs could be endangered by AI (Genpact, 2017). Three years later, this has already become reality.
At Amazon, process automation has been a constant, and one of the keys to the company’s success since its inception. However, in 2015, the company found that its recruitment algorithm did not evaluate software developers in a neutral, non-gender way (Kodiyan, 2019). The root cause was that the systems were trained to screen applicants by looking at patterns in resumes submitted to the company over a 10-year period. Most of the resumes that came in had been from men, so Amazon’s system taught itself that male candidates were more likely to be selected for the job. It penalised resumes that included the word “women”, such as “captain of the women’s chess team”, and demoted graduates of two women’s colleges. Amazon adjusted the algorithm to be neutral in this regard. However, the experts indicated that there were other ways of classifying candidates that could be discriminatory. For this reason, both human intervention and new professional capacities that analyse and program these tools are still necessary.
Just as sales automation tools like Salesforce didn’t make sales reps obsolete, a similar trajectory is anticipated for recruiters. The real challenge is how to improve employee talent and training. Only 38 per cent of companies offer training programmes for workers (Genpact, 2017). Technical skills such as coding, statistics, and applied mathematics remain very important, but “soft skills” such as adaptability, critical thinking, problem solving, and creativity are key factors in selection. Possibly, soft skills are the most complicated part to identify in the evaluation of candidates, as well as being the differentiating element between professionals with very similar technical profiles. If, for example, 1,000 resumes are received for a job, of which 25 are selected, the technical level will be very high and the selection of the candidates will be made based on their best suitability for the company. Therefore, a human profile with a clinical eye is necessary to obtain and interpret this non-visible information from the interviewee. A large number of companies do not have a selection “manual” that tells how and where to find candidates. Recruiters are examining the interviewee, interpreting and experimenting with their tools and skills according to their personal experience. However, the rapid evolution of technology will increasingly develop a combination of people and machines that offer decision-making support (Pin et al., 2020b).
The Candidate’s Perspective
Candidates and employees in general expect not only a job, but also a career that can be planned out. However, according to data from employment offices in the United States and Europe, the trend of decreasing time spent working at a company is growing strongly.
The last two generations, millennials, born between 1985 and 2000, and Gen Z (a.k.a. “centennials”), born after 2000, value, first of all, the activity they are going to carry out, knowing how their professional career is going to evolve, and what type of company they will work for – what their values and culture are (Stein et al., 2018). Unlike the baby boomer generation, born between 1945 and 1964, compensation is not a primary reason for leaving a job (Stein and Mesa, 2020). For millennials, if they are not having fun and learning by collaborating in dynamic environments equipped with new technologies, they will look for other career opportunities in companies that are “cool” or that have a well-defined employee brand or employer brand (McCracken et al., 2016). 
Younger candidates seek information one to two months before applying to a job (Basu et al., 2019), mainly on the company website, but also on LinkedIn, search engines, through contacts who work at the company, Human Resources departments, headhunters or employment portals such as Glassdoor, which allow employees or former employees to publish information about the company that could previously have been considered confidential. Information on how the selection processes are carried out, the difficulty level of the interviews, the salary range by job category, and the pros and cons of working for the company are publicly accessible. If the company does not proactively maintain its employer brand, its attractiveness to younger talent will decrease considerably. If faced with a poor assessment, the External Communications department will have to devise strategies such as publishing positive comments or clarifying the negative ones transparently and quickly.
Artificial Intelligence and Its Components
If the Human Resources department considers it necessary to make changes to their processes, they must know the basics of AI first-hand, the problems that arise when recruiting talent, the technologies available for each phase of the selection process, and the available and most affordable offering on the market.
The concept of artificial intelligence is very broad and includes several more-specific terms, such as: 

automated learning or machine learning
natural language processing 
deep learning
neural networks.

According to the definition by the Royal Spanish Academy (Real Academia Española), artificial intelligence is “the scientific discipline that deals with creating computer programs that execute operations comparable to those carried out by the human mind, such as learning or logical reasoning”.
Machine learning is a type of AI that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
Natural language processing refers to the computer’s ability to understand human language as it is spoken. Natural language processing algorithms use machine learning to learn syntax rules by analysing large sets of examples.
Deep learning can be thought of as a series of machine learning decisions. The results of one decision inform the analysis of the next. The number of data processing layers required for the process is what inspired the term “deep”. To achieve a higher level of accuracy than machine learning can achieve, deep learning programs require access to vast amounts of training data and processing power.
A neural network is a hardware or software system inspired by the functioning of the human nervous system. The network is made up of a set of neurons connected to each other through a series of links.
To better understand how these technologies work, table 1 shows each of them, along with the type of tools, results and real examples of the use of AI in the selection and recruitment phase.

If the general adoption of AI by industry is analysed (see figure 1), the telecommunications, high tech and financial services sectors are the most prominent, although in the Human Resources area, the order varies slightly – the high tech, health systems and services, and telecommunications sectors are those which have a higher degree of automation (McKinsey & Company Survey, 2018). The main reason why high tech and telecommunications companies such as Google, Amazon, Telefónica, and Netflix use automated tools to a greater extent is the difficulty of finding and retaining highly qualified talent among profiles such as data scientists and developers. In the case of the health systems and services sector, the main factors are the progressive ageing of the population, which brings with it a greater burden for medical professionals, and the retirement of nurses, which is creating a large number of unfilled vacancies.

Sectors with a higher demand for profiles with AI skills include high tech, professional services, and financial services. The increased demand for these skills is associated with higher market capitalisation, greater cash holdings, and higher investment in R&D. All of this is consistent when combined with complementary investments in infrastructure, skills, and processes (Alekseeva et al., 2020).
AI Systems in Recruitment and Selection
Access to digital devices and the ease of applying for certain jobs has caused the volume of applications in relation to job offers to increase exponentially for all types of positions. Consequently, recruitment and selection offer a wide variety of opportunities for automation through AI technologies, from candidate screening to resume-to-job matching. In 2018, there were about 70 different technologies that could be used for recruiting automation. Two years later, there are countless. The AI systems that are having the greatest impact are those related to the adaptation of the candidate to the job, through the provision and analysis of data, the rediscovery of talents, facial recognition, the analysis of emotions, verbal communication and interaction, and chatbots or conversation bots (Eubanks, 2018).
The Suitability of the Candidate for the Job
There is empirical data that allows us to affirm that the closer Human Resources professionals get to making the decision, the more necessary it is for the human mind to help the system to filter the candidates in the applicant pool.
The suitability of the candidate for the job (candidate matching) has been verified historically through the identification of keywords that appear in the resume and that coincide with the job ad. However, it is necessary to make additional considerations that analyse the real abilities of the candidate. There are tools, such as video detection, that allow the recruiter to analyse the tone, the use of words and even eye contact. On the technical side, there are systems that quickly evaluate the candidate, for example in the application of a certain programming language associated with the position or in performing assessments. Resumes are stories of everyone’s professional experience told differently, which can hide certain skills that the human eye can detect. There is empirical data that allows us to affirm that the closer Human Resources professionals get to making the decision, the more necessary it is for the human mind to help the system to filter the candidates in the applicant pool.
An example of an assistant that provides information to the candidate about roles within the company that match their experience and skills is IBM Watson Candidate Assistant. Previously, the first contact between recruiters and candidates would be during the job interview. Nowadays, during the job search phase, the candidate can receive personalised advice from a chatbot that provides information to adjust and limit their search to specific roles. The result of this implementation has been a greater conversion of high-potential candidates to the roles offered by IBM. On average, the company receives 7,000 resumes daily and the use of new technology enables a search conversion of 36 per cent, compared to 12 per cent received by a traditional employment portal. In addition, it has been possible to reduce the hiring time by detecting the ideal candidates for the position more quickly.
Data Provision and Analysis
The provision and analysis of data allows access to a much larger number of candidates, whether they come directly from consulting companies or through the sourcing of external talent data, so that recruiters can contact them directly. 
The tools can be databases connected to the company, or external ones. An example is the intelligent search tools that use keywords to find candidates according to the needs of the company. Currently, the main database for companies is LinkedIn, which offers a wide range of candidates for recruiters and headhunters. The LinkedIn Recruiter Tool uses machine learning to improve the recommendation engine. One of the technologies employed in the product is candidate responsiveness, benefiting those who are most responsive. Some of the questions included in the algorithm are: How receptive has the candidate been when contacted by the recruiter on previous occasions? How responsive has the candidate been when being contacted by recruiters, companies, or industries? Is there any recent job search activity? Other companies that are developing selection algorithms are Google and Microsoft. In 2016, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella introduced Cortana’s AI integration with LinkedIn data, so that a conference or webinar organiser could plan content by getting to know their attendees better by visiting their profiles in this online professional network. Google, on the other hand, has developed the Job Search on Google product, implementing machine learning to improve the candidate’s experience during the job search. These are already almost “prehistoric” milestones in the sector.
However, machines can miss suitable candidates. For example, if you’re looking for software developers, you may be missing out on dozens of variations and specialities, such as front-end developer, software tester, or specialist in specific programming languages. Therefore, when the automated job search system has previously processed this type of job, it will have connected other skills or similar positions of the candidates through machine learning. This functionality may not be as useful for a senior recruiter with extensive recruiting experience, but for a junior profile it might be very helpful. Additionally, once the job listing is published, automated systems can automatically search for potential candidates and contact them directly with an automated message. This phase undertaken by a human being can require between eight and 30 hours for a given job, depending on how specialised it is. 
With IBM Watson Recruitment, the cognitive system increases recruiter efficiency by highlighting job priorities that demand the most attention. It works with applicant statistics or automatic qualification by analysing factors such as the length of experience in relevant roles, the size of the companies that hired them, and the prestige of the university degree.
Talent Rediscovery
The rediscovery of talent takes advantage of a database with valuable profiles that have already been registered. The advantage is that, after a few years, you can find emerging talent that has been trained in an area of interest. The reality is that there are a huge number of resumes that have been accumulated over the years in a company and that have not been reviewed. If, for example, a company has published 100 positions, there can easily be 25,000 candidacies that have not been analysed. Many of these profiles may be out of date, but there are AI systems that use algorithms that identify patterns of success in the selection process of candidates who were ultimately not selected. 
Rediscovering talent also means that all the candidates who have applied receive a response from the company. If virtual friendliness is maintained, potential candidates can be contacted again in the future. Eighty per cent of job applicants say they would not reapply to a company that did not notify them of their application status or did not give them a final response (Career Builder, 2018).
Facial Recognition 
Through algorithms, facial recognition tools provide recruiters with the ability to process the video content of the interview. One of the elements that the AI can recognise is whether the candidates are looking at the camera or reading a script. By observing the position of the eye and the direction in which it looks, the system can recognise cheating. Above all, it is useful for tests that the candidate performs from home, without the supervision of a recruiter. 
Another element is analysing the candidate’s micro-expressions. The momentary and involuntary expressions that appear on the human face can help robots identify the personality or thinking style of the person being interviewed. Furthermore, it helps the recruiter analyse the emotional reactions to each interview question, specifying how honest or enthusiastic the interviewee has been in their response. Companies such as Unilever already use this technology, and it has made it possible to interview a large number of candidates, which would not have been possible otherwise (see the Unilever case in the Exhibit). These systems are not only available to companies, they can also be used by candidates preparing for their interviews by providing predetermined questions, receiving reports on their facial expressions or personality styles and, by the same token, improve their performance in the final interview. 
The final assessment of the candidate by the AI system can be based on a comparison with the best-performing employees of the company. If, for example, a candidate applies for a sales manager position, their facial expressions will be compared to benchmarks in the sales area. This method ensures that the company’s performance level is maintained or even improved with the new talent (Schellmann and Bellini, 2018).
Verbal Communication and Interaction with AI
Automated chatbots or conversation bots would provide us with automated answers to user questions. The candidate could resolve questions about available job opportunities, possible professional careers, and advice on how to improve their own career. Fifty-eight per cent of job seekers are comfortable interacting with AI applications, and more than 60 per cent are happy to interact with chatbots to answer initial questions and schedule interviews with recruiters (Allegis Global, 2017). Candidate questions can be about salaries, job specifications, company information, the recruiting process, work culture and environment, chatbot-related information, or more general questions.
Another functionality that robots can provide is the analysis of elements such as the tone of voice or the set of words used. To do this, “smart” speakers can be integrated into meeting and work spaces to listen to conversations a posteriori and provide more thoughtful insights. What if the head of the HR team could listen to their employees’ interviews and then give them ideas on how to improve results? Would it improve talent acquisition?
Analysis of the Emotions and Personality of the Candidates
The analysis of emotions of the candidates allows analysis of large amounts of text and classifying it according to the disposition they show. The systems combine natural language processing with machine learning. The analysis can use unstructured texts from conversations, emails, and content that they have published on social media or on their website. If someone writes, for example: “I didn’t like my previous job because it didn’t allow me to develop my professional career,” the machine will associate it with negative feelings, whereas if they write, “Throughout my career I have worked with great teams,” it will be associated with a positive feeling. 
There are AI systems that compare the resume with the candidate’s social media, such as LinkedIn, Twitter or Facebook, identifying personality traits that help recruiters make decisions about compatibility with the job or company culture (Schellmann and Bellini, 2018). 
The Potential Biases and Lack of Privacy of AI Systems
Algorithms and automated systems for candidates and companies can become black boxes whose inner workings are a mystery. When one of these services is contracted, it is necessary to understand how it works and what biases are associated with it, because it is the human mind that programs the algorithm and has it make automated decisions. 
AI systems can make the mistake of considering patterns of facial expressions that do not correspond or are not necessary for the job that candidates are looking for. Thus, the recruitment format is not able to select the employees who can best perform the job. Let’s take for example, the case of a young Korean who recently graduated from the University of Illinois and who had more than 30 interviews, of which almost half were conducted by a robot. He did not get past the first phase in any of them. However, he was hired as a junior credit analyst at a local bank in Chicago and, according to his boss, is one of the five best young people who have joined the bank in the 30 years of his professional experience (Schellmann and Bellini, 2018). A second element is the lack of privacy in this type of recording, so the employee or candidate must know what personal data is being used and give their prior consent. 
To effectively enjoy the benefits of automated hiring, a hybrid approach between human and machine should be established, followed by labour and administrative legislation in line with the changes in process automation. This requires collective bargaining to establish data collection standards that guarantee equal opportunities in employment (Ajunwa, forthcoming). 
Along these lines, in 2020 the European Commission published a white paper that contains the guidelines for regulating AI and eliminating possible bias, the suppression of dissent, and the lack of privacy. In it, the Commission recommends ensuring that AI systems are trained on representative data, that companies keep detailed documentation of how algorithms were developed, inform people when they are interacting with AI, and the need for human oversight of these systems (Chen, 2020). In some cities, such as New York City, a bill has even been introduced that governs the sale and use of any automated employment decision tool. Companies selling these AI systems must provide an annual bias audit to the buyer. Additionally, the bill requires recruiters to notify the candidate of the use of AI technology to assess their application within 30 business days (Forman et al., 2020). 
The Application of Automation in Everyday Business Affairs
There is a difference in salaries for vacancies that require AI and those that do not, with a salary increase of up to 51 per cent. In managerial positions, the highest salary premium is for those with this type of skill.
The main barriers or obstacles for companies (see figure 2) have to do with the lack of budget for investing in new technologies. The company must have sufficient cash and liquidity to assume not only the costs of the technologies, but also the training of professionals in skills to manage AI. The second concern is the lack of Human Resources professionals trained to use the systems. Leading tech companies such as Google and Amazon are vying to attract this scarce talent in light of this new latent demand. 
The general hiring trend has seen a large increase in the recruitment of AI-savvy personnel (see figure 3). In addition, there is a difference in salaries for vacancies that require AI and those that do not, with a salary increase of up to 51 per cent. In managerial positions, the highest salary premium is for those with this type of skill (Alekseeva et al., 2019).


Small and medium-sized companies have a harder time recruiting and training the necessary talent, so they are more reluctant to adopt new systems. The third reason is the lack of confidence that AI can achieve a considerable improvement in the areas of Human Resources, mainly because of the two previous reasons, but also due to a certain resistance to change in the organisation. Historically, personal intuition and experience have been the most reliable skills compared to machines or automated systems, due to their biases and, in many cases, they turn out to be black boxes for users, because they are unaware of their internal functioning (HR Research Institute, 2019).
Table 2 shows a method for identifying recruitment and selection areas that can be automated. When the Human Resources department thinks about inserting new AI systems, it has to ask questions like these: What tasks are executed most effectively 24/7? Which processes would be better for running on a large scale? What elements would benefit from being consistent? What would be possible, in selection and recruitment, if we go beyond our current limits? (Guenole and Feinzig, 2018).

In the area of recruitment, it would improve the identification of candidates that match job requirements and compile lists of qualified applicants. In the filtering area, it is expected to prioritise resumes and applications that most closely match the requirements of the position. In terms of interviews, the aim is to speed up the hiring process. In the selection area, it would be tasked with filtering resumes more efficiently, helping to adapt the skills and abilities of the candidates to the labour needs of the company, to carry out rapid training and insertion (HR Research Institute, 2019).
By using table 2, the reader can weigh up whether or not it is necessary to implement changes using new AI technologies in the Human Resources area of their company. The first column presents all the areas that concern the selection and recruitment phase. The next asks about the specific challenges in each area. The reader should ask relevant questions, analysing the problems or opportunities that, if solved, could generate significant value. The third column provides a practical application of what kind of AI systems can improve the development of each process and if there are companies that offer products on the market. A review of the available tools should be carried out. The fourth column serves to analyse the internal obstacles that exist within the organisation to implementing these systems, and the external obstacles caused by the legislative, cultural, economic, and political context. The last column invites a personal and complex analysis of the power and ability to influence the employee or senior manager within the organisation, the information available to them about the AI tools available on the market and the needs of the organisation, the individual and common interests in the Human Resources department and the rest of the company, and the type of relationship that can be established with other employees after the initiatives have been taken.
Summary
The incorporation of automated processes is a necessity for companies to save costs and time, and allow workers to carry out value-added activities. However, the recent pandemic has meant that, in most cases, companies do not have the financial resources and sufficient data available, nor the necessary talent to optimise processes with AI systems.
In the selection and recruitment area, the recruiter will not lose their job due to the appearance of machines that can automate certain tasks such as the analysis of resumes, but rather there will be a slow transition to new jobs that require new technological and personal skills. In general, younger candidates prioritise professional development and job content, so they will be more willing to train in these new technologies. But the company will also need to work on its employer brand to attract this type of talent.
AI has been developing at a global level more rapidly in the last decade, already being able to imitate, through neural networks, the functioning of the human brain and to learn by itself. The results in the selection and recruitment area have been the numerous tools that use AI to improve the candidate’s match with the job, provide better data analysis, rediscover new talent, facially recognise the candidate, analyse their emotions and communicate and interact verbally through chatbots or conversation bots.
However, these machines are still at an early stage of their development and make mistakes – just like humans – such as certain biases in data analysis, not properly recognising some facial expressions, or not responding appropriately to the needs of the person. European legislation and some cities have proposed a first attempt at regulation through greater transparency from vendors to customers about the operation of the algorithms’ black boxes. 
The potential of these systems is undeniable, although their development and accessibility may be more limited and unequal with respect to the entire business fabric. Large companies are already implementing these tools and increasingly automating their processes, which is why it is considered necessary for the Human Resources department and management in general to proactively weigh up the management challenges posed by AI systems and manage them properly – leading a future that has already arrived.
Final Considerations
Today, a digital maturity is needed, which is the same as always but updated, because becoming a digital organisation entails a tectonic movement in the activities of managers and professionals, in their individual behaviour and in how they relate to each other inside and outside the company.
Technology enables access to huge amounts of information about oneself and about others, and improves communication and contact in immediacy and frequency. Nevertheless, it would seem that, in general, the possibility of doing so does not serve to encourage knowing oneself, self-awareness, and, therefore, maturity. Today, a digital maturity is needed, which is the same as always but updated, because becoming a digital organisation entails a tectonic movement in the activities of managers and professionals, in their individual behaviour and in how they relate to each other inside and outside the company. It’s not just about having powerful AI tools to use with customers, processes, products, services, and (as described above) candidates. It is imperative to refine a culture at the level of digitisation that guides us in our process of approaching transformation.  
Exhibit
Unilever CaseUnilever is a world leader in consumer goods. The company’s products can be found in more than 190 countries. Its more than 400 brands meet the needs of its consumers in terms of personal and home care, food, and other goods. To meet the dynamic and changing demands of consumers, Unilever recognised the need to attract talent from around the world, specifically appealing to the millennial workforce. Melissa Gee Kee, CHRO & Global HR4HR Strategy Head, said: “Our executives expect 60 per cent of our workforce to be millennials by 2020. With this in mind, we needed to engage with this generation through innovative technology that is engaging, dynamic, and capable of moving quickly.” The Unilever team partnered with multiple solution suppliers to create a complete candidate experience using HireVue to initiate mobile-optimised, recorded video interviews along with interview evaluation technology. With HireVue Evaluation, the AI analysed the candidates’ recorded interviews to filter out up to 80 per cent of them. The proprietary algorithm analyses the most likely to be successful at Unilever based on interview attributes such as facial expressions, body language, and word choice, which have been shown to be predictive of job success. Unilever has implemented this recruitment process in 53 countries in multiple languages, and over 80 per cent of candidate feedback is positive. The process not only improved the candidate experience, but it also saved the company over 50,000 hours, providing Unilever with substantial gains. In just one year, the Unilever team saved over £1 million, cut recruitment time by 75 per cent, and hired the most gender and ethnically diverse workforce to date.

“A significant portion of the workforce could be facing displacement as artificial intelligence gains complexity and popularity”–Paul Ebeling
Technology advancements are being used to help people work more productively, to improve the lives of individuals, to make certain tasks faster and more convenient, and even to save lives.
To business leaders, the prospect of artificial intelligence is thrilling. Robots can be faster and more efficient than workers, and though they might require some upkeep; AI tools tend to be much more affordable than human employees. 
Considering that AI solutions are becoming proficient at several “human” jobs, some futurist executives are looking forward to a time when most of their workforce consists of smart computers.
Yet, most AI experts claim that this future vision will never come. Instead of replacing human intelligence with artificial intelligence, workplaces will rely on a brand-new way of processing information and making decisions called collaborative intelligence.
There are less than 5% of occupations we automate entirely, but around 60% of occupations could have at least 30% of their tasks automated, and that number is likely to grow over the next 15 yrs. Thus, a significant portion of the workforce could be facing displacement as artificial intelligence gains complexity and popularity.
Most organizations see significant benefits in replacing human workers with machines, but these benefits hide serious downsides. Though machines might be more efficient and cost less than a human employee, existing AI solutions have narrow applications and are nearly impossible to adapt to new tasks or inputs. Thus, more significant changes in business strategy might require an AI overhaul, which could be more time-consuming and more expensive than assigning new responsibilities to a human workforce.
To harness the advantages of AI without succumbing to the disadvantages of non-human staff; businesses need to avoid displacement as much as possible and instead utilize collaborative intelligence.
Collaborative intelligence is merging the strengths of a human workforce with the strengths of AI. The goal of collaborative intelligence is to design human positions to best augment the capabilities of AI tools and systems and vice versa. 
In a collaborative intelligence model, human employees have three crucial roles; train intelligent machines, explain the outcomes of AI efforts and sustain the responsible use of artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, AI has three functions: to amplify cognition, extend physical capabilities, and free humans for higher-level tasks. Humans and machines come to rely on one another, and the business sees only benefits from adopting AI.
Organizations should cultivate a workforce with the skills to integrate with AI machines seamlessly. Learning to delegate tasks to AI can take time; learning to navigate AI interfaces and decipher the results of AI efforts. Business leaders should train their current workforce and onboard new employees who have experience collaborating with AI.
Artificial intelligence is a promising technological development for business productivity; it should not be expected to do all the work of human employees. 
By envisioning a future based on collaborative intelligence, businesses can radically improve productivity and quality without compromising on any aspect of their operations.
Have a prosperous day, Keep the Faith!
