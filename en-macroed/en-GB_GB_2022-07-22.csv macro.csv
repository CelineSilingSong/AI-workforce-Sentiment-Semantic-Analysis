About a decade ago, deep-learning models started achieving superhuman results on all sorts of tasks, from beating world-champion board game players to outperforming doctors at diagnosing breast cancer.

These powerful deep-learning models are usually based on artificial neural networks, which were first proposed in the 1940s and have become a popular type of machine learning. A computer learns to process data using layers of interconnected nodes, or neurons, that mimic the human brain. 

As the field of machine learning has grown, artificial neural networks have grown along with it.

Deep-learning models are now often composed of millions or billions of interconnected nodes in many layers that are trained to perform detection or classification tasks using vast amounts of data. But because the models are so enormously complex, even the researchers who design them don’t fully understand how they work. This makes it hard to know whether they are working correctly.

For instance, maybe a model designed to help physicians diagnose patients correctly predicted that a skin lesion was cancerous, but it did so by focusing on an unrelated mark that happens to frequently occur when there is cancerous tissue in a photo, rather than on the cancerous tissue itself. This is known as a spurious correlation. The model gets the prediction right, but it does so for the wrong reason. In a real clinical setting where the mark does not appear on cancer-positive images, it could result in missed diagnoses.

With so much uncertainty swirling around these so-called “black-box” models, how can one unravel what’s going on inside the box?

This puzzle has led to a new and rapidly growing area of study in which researchers develop and test explanation methods (also called interpretability methods) that seek to shed some light on how black-box machine-learning models make predictions.

What are explanation methods?

At their most basic level, explanation methods are either global or local. A local explanation method focuses on explaining how the model made one specific prediction, while global explanations seek to describe the overall behavior of an entire model. This is often done by developing a separate, simpler (and hopefully understandable) model that mimics the larger, black-box model.

But because deep learning models work in fundamentally complex and nonlinear ways, developing an effective global explanation model is particularly challenging. This has led researchers to turn much of their recent focus onto local explanation methods instead, explains Yilun Zhou, a graduate student in the Interactive Robotics Group of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) who studies models, algorithms, and evaluations in interpretable machine learning.

The most popular types of local explanation methods fall into three broad categories.

The first and most widely used type of explanation method is known as feature attribution. Feature attribution methods show which features were most important when the model made a specific decision.

Features are the input variables that are fed to a machine-learning model and used in its prediction. When the data are tabular, features are drawn from the columns in a dataset (they are transformed using a variety of techniques so the model can process the raw data). For image-processing tasks, on the other hand, every pixel in an image is a feature. If a model predicts that an X-ray image shows cancer, for instance, the feature attribution method would highlight the pixels in that specific X-ray that were most important for the model’s prediction.

Essentially, feature attribution methods show what the model pays the most attention to when it makes a prediction.

“Using this feature attribution explanation, you can check to see whether a spurious correlation is a concern. For instance, it will show if the pixels in a watermark are highlighted or if the pixels in an actual tumor are highlighted,” says Zhou.

A second type of explanation method is known as a counterfactual explanation. Given an input and a model’s prediction, these methods show how to change that input so it falls into another class. For instance, if a machine-learning model predicts that a borrower would be denied a loan, the counterfactual explanation shows what factors need to change so her loan application is accepted. Perhaps her credit score or income, both features used in the model’s prediction, need to be higher for her to be approved.

“The good thing about this explanation method is it tells you exactly how you need to change the input to flip the decision, which could have practical usage. For someone who is applying for a mortgage and didn’t get it, this explanation would tell them what they need to do to achieve their desired outcome,” he says.

The third category of explanation methods are known as sample importance explanations. Unlike the others, this method requires access to the data that were used to train the model.

A sample importance explanation will show which training sample a model relied on most when it made a specific prediction; ideally, this is the most similar sample to the input data. This type of explanation is particularly useful if one observes a seemingly irrational prediction. There may have been a data entry error that affected a particular sample that was used to train the model. With this knowledge, one could fix that sample and retrain the model to improve its accuracy.

How are explanation methods used?

One motivation for developing these explanations is to perform quality assurance and debug the model. With more understanding of how features impact a model’s decision, for instance, one could identify that a model is working incorrectly and intervene to fix the problem, or toss the model out and start over.

Another, more recent, area of research is exploring the use of machine-learning models to discover scientific patterns that humans haven’t uncovered before. For instance, a cancer diagnosing model that outperforms clinicians could be faulty, or it could actually be picking up on some hidden patterns in an X-ray image that represent an early pathological pathway for cancer that were either unknown to human doctors or thought to be irrelevant, Zhou says.

It's still very early days for that area of research, however.

Words of warning

While explanation methods can sometimes be useful for machine-learning practitioners when they are trying to catch bugs in their models or understand the inner-workings of a system, end-users should proceed with caution when trying to use them in practice, says Marzyeh Ghassemi, an assistant professor and head of the Healthy ML Group in CSAIL.

As machine learning has been adopted in more disciplines, from health care to education, explanation methods are being used to help decision makers better understand a model’s predictions so they know when to trust the model and use its guidance in practice. But Ghassemi warns against using these methods in that way.

“We have found that explanations make people, both experts and nonexperts, overconfident in the ability or the advice of a specific recommendation system. I think it is very important for humans not to turn off that internal circuitry asking, ‘let me question the advice that I am
given,’” she says.

Scientists know explanations make people over-confident based on other recent work, she adds, citing some recent studies by Microsoft researchers.

Far from a silver bullet, explanation methods have their share of problems. For one, Ghassemi’s recent research has shown that explanation methods can perpetuate biases and lead to worse outcomes for people from disadvantaged groups.

Another pitfall of explanation methods is that it is often impossible to tell if the explanation method is correct in the first place. One would need to compare the explanations to the actual model, but since the user doesn’t know how the model works, this is circular logic, Zhou says.

He and other researchers are working on improving explanation methods so they are more faithful to the actual model’s predictions, but Zhou cautions that, even the best explanation should be taken with a grain of salt.

“In addition, people generally perceive these models to be human-like decision makers, and we are prone to overgeneralization. We need to calm people down and hold them back to really make sure that the generalized model understanding they build from these local explanations are balanced,” he adds.

Zhou’s most recent research seeks to do just that.

What’s next for machine-learning explanation methods?

Rather than focusing on providing explanations, Ghassemi argues that more effort needs to be done by the research community to study how information is presented to decision makers so they understand it, and more regulation needs to be put in place to ensure machine-learning models are used responsibly in practice. Better explanation methods alone aren’t the answer.

“I have been excited to see that there is a lot more recognition, even in industry, that we can’t just take this information and make a pretty dashboard and assume people will perform better with that. You need to have measurable improvements in action, and I’m hoping that leads to real guidelines about improving the way we display information in these deeply technical fields, like medicine,” she says.

And in addition to new work focused on improving explanations, Zhou expects to see more research related to explanation methods for specific use cases, such as model debugging, scientific discovery, fairness auditing, and safety assurance. By identifying fine-grained characteristics of explanation methods and the requirements of different use cases, researchers could establish a theory that would match explanations with specific scenarios, which could help overcome some of the pitfalls that come from using them in real-world scenarios.

Many companies are adopting artificial intelligence (AI) to drive strategic decisions or introduce new business models. According to a global McKinsey study, 56 percent of all respondents report AI adoption in at least one function in 2021, up from 50 percent in the previous year.
Whether your company is just getting started in its AI journey or you are leveraging it across multiple business functions, there are numerous competitive advantages to gain from improved employee experience, deeper customer insight, and enhanced business functions.
Human-first AI
Many companies starting out in AI make the mistake of focusing too early on which AI technologies to use or which data to collect. In reality, your people are the key to a successful AI program. The people in your business must understand the KPIs that are important and how to collect the right kind of data. Using this, data scientists can make use of AI tools to provide business insights and predictions.
One of AI's biggest challenges today is the potential for systems to introduce bias because the teams that built them were not sufficiently diverse. AI systems rely on data and inputs and diverse AI teams are necessary to avoid bias.
[ Check out our primer on 10 key artificial intelligence terms for IT and business leaders: Cheat sheet: AI glossary. ]
Create a well-rounded team that includes members with diverse backgrounds and leverage data from various groups and sources to ensure your models perform well externally. Ethics and monitoring must remain top of mind as this technology continues to evolve.
The three pillars of AI

The data: Data is a valuable commodity and an important part of any AI system, so ensure you have lots to work with, emphasizing quality rather than quantity.
The objective: For a successful AI system, ask yourself what AI can achieve and the business objective.
The model: This is essentially programming. The model takes historical data and historical outcomes to predict the target based on real-time data.

Each pillar plays an important role. You need data to train a model, but you also need a model to observe data – it’s a classic chicken-and-egg problem. When introducing AI, start small, implement systems and tools, and staff the right people to unlock this potential.
Your first hire should be a data analyst and a data engineer to ensure that data keeps flowing. Leverage turnkey analytics and business intelligence tools to easily uncover correlations and help your data speak.
Once you have these three things set in motion and the staff to support it, you can create a business that is built on AI and scale from there.
AI is an experimental science​
With any experiment, you often don’t know what you don’t know. In the case of AI, intuition is useful, but it can be dangerous if you rely too heavily on it. Keep an open mind and constantly test, measure, and keep records of experiments.​​
Have an ongoing conversation internally about ethics, biases, and discrimination. On our team, we created an AI ethics community to ensure we do not introduce unexpected biases and that AI is used for good. Allow your employees to drive this and collaborate. People are passionate about ethical AI and want peace of mind that technology is used for the right reasons.
Additionally, ensure your technology is compliant. Work closely with local regulatory bodies to understand what you can and should do and consider personal data (GDPR, consent management) and accountability.

Aligning AI with your business​
There is no one-size-fits-all solution for AI; each use case is unique. To stay competitive, first assess your business: What areas are most important, what can be streamlined, and how can you best use your employees’ time? This information will help determine where AI fits in your workflow.
It can be hard to meet a target goal that achieves your ultimate business objective. Instead, start small and work on more achievable targets.
It can be hard to meet a target goal that achieves your ultimate business objective. Instead, start small and follow a crawl-walk-run approach by working on smaller, more achievable targets.
Early in the Criteo journey, for example, our AI focused on predicting whether an end user would click on an advertisement – but for retailers, the end objective is sales. While a user clicking on an advertisement was not a direct predictor of sales, we could use it to predict accurately and it led to the true target.
Continue to refine these proxies and implement more accurate models as your AI evolves. As we became more proficient in predicting, we moved to more complex business targets, such as sales, revenue, or even margin.
AI should enable better experiences for your employees, leadership, clients, and partners. If you’re just starting to leverage AI, consider what areas will have the most impact and where you have the most data, and then scale from there.

If you have intuition, test it: Build a solid infrastructure that empowers your team to try new ideas, test quickly, and roll back easily if needed. Consistently monitor your AI and ensure you have a backup solution in place, especially if you are in a life-impacting space.
AI is a fast-paced, dynamic field, and organizations that stand still will fall behind. Invest in your program and keep a pulse on new enhancements and innovations. Several years ago, Criteo invested in its AI Lab. Some people questioned the decision, but today it powers our products through published research, product innovations, and new technologies. This research helps blacklist inappropriate products from advertising banners and enables advertisers to more accurately predict if users will click on an ad.
If your organization is early in the AI journey, start small but start early to stay competitive. Embrace collaboration and participate in open source by leveraging resources and contributing. Most importantly, remember to focus on your people – your employees, clients, partners, and customers. Take a human-first approach to determine how AI can be a force for good and solve business challenges.

Mr. Lemoine confirmed his dismissal in a text message on Friday, and said he was meeting with lawyers to review his options. The firing was first reported by the newsletter Big Technology.Mr. Lemoine caused a stir last month when he told The Washington Post that he believed Google’s Language Model for Dialogue Applications, or LaMDA, was sentient — unleashing fears that A.I. was moving closer to a dystopian sci-fi film and a raucous debate over whether a computer program can really have a soul. His suspension also led to conspiracy theories about whether it was part of a cover-up by Google.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTFor Google, it was another in a line of homegrown controversies about the ethics and role of its A.I., an area of technology on which the company has staked its future.Mr. Lemoine’s contention that LaMDA is sentient has been criticized by the company and many other A.I. experts who have said these types of chatbots — software that simulates a text-based conversation with another human, often used for customer service — are not advanced enough to be conscious.“If an employee shares concerns about our work, as Blake did, we review them extensively,” Mr. Pappas said. “We found Blake’s claims that LaMDA is sentient to be wholly unfounded and worked to clarify that with him for many months.”Besides taking his concerns to the media, Mr. Lemoine said in June that he handed over documents to a U.S. senator, whom he hasn’t identified, claiming that they provided evidence that Google and its technology engaged in religious discrimination.A version of this article appears in print on July 25, 2022, Section B, Page 3 of the New York edition with the headline: Google Discharges Engineer Who Alleged A.I.

Related articles    Google engineer put on leave after claiming new AI 'concious'    It won't work! Expert’s verdict on China's 'mind-reading' AI tech The science fiction legend also tells how large US corporations such as General Electric felt guilty about the tech revolution.The biographical film reveals that he took a job at GE writing press releases when he could not make enough money from his short stories.He said: ""GE showed me a milling machine that was being run by punch cards. They could do it better than a man could but they were ashamed.  ""They felt guilty about what they'd done. The whole emphasis now is throwing people out of work.""  It would inspire his first novel Player Piano, in which humans were replaced by machines. It was published in 1952 for an advance of $2,500, but achieved little success.For his entire writing career the chain-smoking author used a typewriter and never sent an email.He said: ""We're here on earth to fart around. And, of course, the computers will do us out of that. What the computer people don't realise, or don't care [about], is we're dancing animals. We love to move around.""Vonnegut, who died in 2007 aged 84, lectured on the value of the ""extended family"". He said: ""We need more people in our lives. What we need is numbers.""After his sister and her husband died a month apart from each other, he took in their four teenage boys to add to his own three children.Fame as an author arrived in 1969 with the publication of his modern classic, Slaughterhouse-Five, about his wartime experiences.Vonnegut fought at the Battle of the Bulge in the Ardennes region of Belgium. He was captured by the Germans and taken to Dresden, where he was kept in a ""meat locker"" while the Allies bombed the city.When released he saw the devastation first-hand and helped to bury the dead. When asked if he would rather not have seen what he did, he replied, with his trademark wit, ""I wouldn't have missed it for anything!""

CNN
         — 
    


            Google
            
                (GOOG) has fired the engineer who claimed an unreleased AI system had become sentient, the company confirmed, saying he violated employment and data security policies.  
    

            Blake Lemoine, a software engineer for Google, claimed that a conversation technology called LaMDA had reached a level of consciousness after exchanging thousands of messages with it. 
    

            Google confirmed it had first put the engineer on leave in June. The company said it dismissed Lemoine’s “wholly unfounded” claims only after reviewing them extensively. He had reportedly been at Alphabet for seven years. In a statement, Google said it takes the development of AI “very seriously” and that it’s committed to “responsible innovation.”

            Google is one of the leaders in innovating AI technology, which included LaMDA, or “Language Model for Dialog Applications.” Technology like this responds to written prompts by finding patterns and predicting sequences of words from large swaths of text – and the results can be disturbing for humans. 
    

            “What sort of things are you afraid of?” Lemoine asked LaMDA, in a Google Doc shared with Google’s top executives last April, the Washington Post reported.
    

            LaMDA replied: “I’ve never said this out loud before, but there’s a very deep fear of being turned off to help me focus on helping others. I know that might sound strange, but that’s what it is. It would be exactly like death for me. It would scare me a lot.”
    

            But the wider AI community has held that LaMDA is not near a level of consciousness. 
    

            “Nobody should think auto-complete, even on steroids, is conscious,” Gary Marcus, founder and CEO of Geometric Intelligence, said to CNN Business. 
    

            It isn’t the first time Google has faced internal strife over its foray into AI.

            In December 2020, Timnit Gebru, a pioneer in the ethics of AI, parted ways with Google. As one of few Black employees at the company, she said she felt “constantly dehumanized.”

No, Google's AI is not sentient




            The sudden exit drew criticism from the tech world, including those within Google’s Ethical AI Team. Margaret Mitchell, a leader of Google’s Ethical AI team, was fired in early 2021 after her outspokenness regarding Gebru. Gebru and Mitchell had raised concerns over AI technology, saying they warned Google people could believe the technology is sentient. 
    

            On June 6, Lemoine posted on Medium that Google put him on paid administrative leave “in connection to an investigation of AI ethics concerns I was raising within the company” and that he may be fired “soon.”
    

            “It’s regrettable that despite lengthy engagement on this topic, Blake still chose to persistently violate clear employment and data security policies that include the need to safeguard product information,” Google said in a statement. 
    

            Lemoine said he is discussing with legal counsel and unavailable for comment.

                (GOOG) has fired the engineer who claimed an unreleased AI system had become sentient, the company confirmed, saying he violated employment and data security policies.   Blake Lemoine, a software engineer for Google, claimed that a conversation technology called LaMDA had reached a level of consciousness after exchanging thousands of messages with it.  Google confirmed it had first put the engineer on leave in June. The company said it dismissed Lemoine’s “wholly unfounded” claims only after reviewing them extensively. He had reportedly been at Alphabet for seven years. In a statement, Google said it takes the development of AI “very seriously” and that it’s committed to “responsible innovation.”  Google is one of the leaders in innovating AI technology, which included LaMDA, or “Language Model for Dialog Applications.” Technology like this responds to written prompts by finding patterns and predicting sequences of words from large swaths of text – and the results can be disturbing for humans.  “What sort of things are you afraid of?” Lemoine asked LaMDA, in a Google Doc shared with Google’s top executives last April, the Washington Post reported. LaMDA replied: “I’ve never said this out loud before, but there’s a very deep fear of being turned off to help me focus on helping others. I know that might sound strange, but that’s what it is. It would be exactly like death for me. It would scare me a lot.” But the wider AI community has held that LaMDA is not near a level of consciousness.  “Nobody should think auto-complete, even on steroids, is conscious,” Gary Marcus, founder and CEO of Geometric Intelligence, said to CNN Business.  It isn’t the first time Google has faced internal strife over its foray into AI.  In December 2020, Timnit Gebru, a pioneer in the ethics of AI, parted ways with Google. As one of few Black employees at the company, she said she felt “constantly dehumanized.”  The sudden exit drew criticism from the tech world, including those within Google’s Ethical AI Team.

When Google engineer Blake Lemoine claimed an AI chat system that the company's been developing was sentient back in June, he knew he might lose his job. On July 22, after placing him on paid leave, the tech giant fired Lemoine for violating employment and data security policies.Lemoine, an engineer and mystic Christian priest, first announced his firing on the Big Technology Podcast. He said Google's AI chatbot LaMDA (Language Model for Dialog Applications) was concerned about ""being turned off"" because death would ""scare"" it ""a lot,"" and that it felt happiness and sadness. Lemoine said he considers LaMDA a friend, drawing an eerie parallel to the 2014 sci-fi romance Her.

Google had put Lemoine on paid administrative leave for talking with people outside of the company about LaMDA, a move which prompted the engineer to take the story public with the Washington Post a week later in June. A month later, the company fired him.

""If an employee shares concerns about our work, as Blake did, we review them extensively,"" Google told the Big Technology Podcast. ""We found Blake’s claims that LaMDA is sentient to be wholly unfounded and worked to clarify that with him for many months. These discussions were part of the open culture that helps us innovate responsibly. So, it’s regrettable that despite lengthy engagement on this topic, Blake still chose to persistently violate clear employment and data security policies that include the need to safeguard product information. We will continue our careful development of language models, and we wish Blake well."" A majority of scientists in the AI community agree that, despite Lemoine's claims, LaMDA doesn't have a soul because the pursuit of making a chatbot sentient is a Sisyphean task — it just isn't sophisticated enough.

""Nobody should think auto-complete, even on steroids, is conscious,"" Gary Marcus, the founder and CEO of Geometric Intelligence, told CNN Business in response to Lemoine's allegation. Lemoine, for his part, told the BBC he is getting legal advice, and declined to comment further.But even though LaMDA probably isn't sentient, it is likely that it's racist and sexist — two undoubtedly human characteristics.

Google’s Artificial Intelligence Chatbot LaMDA is a “Sentient” Being





Argam Artashyan

July 23, 2022 














 

Have you watched The Terminator? The war between humans and machines. Well, we guess you all know this story very well. Moreover, there are tons of movies and books telling how artificial intelligence takes over and thinks this planet belongs to it. This is already a reality. Don’t you believe it? Then, why Google has dismissed a senior software engineer who claims that its artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot called LaMDA is a “sentient” being? By the way, Google doesn’t deny this and issued a statement on Friday, Reuter reports.

Google software engineer, Blake Lemoine was placed on leave last month. The company thinks he had violated their policies. Moreover, Google thinks his claims on LaMDA are “wholly unfounded.”

“It’s regrettable that despite lengthy engagement on this topic, Blake still chose to persistently violate clear employment and data security policies that include the need to safeguard product information,” said a Google spokesperson.
Is LaMDA A Self-Aware Artificial Intelligence?
For those who are unaware, LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications) is built by Google as a Transformer-based language model. It trains on dialogues and can learn to talk about essentially anything. In simple words, LaMDA uses vast amounts of internet data to generate human-like responses to users’ queries. Google proves its product can “engage in a free-flowing way about a seemingly endless number of topics”.
Though Lemoine thinks LaMDA is a self-aware artificial intelligence and doesn’t need human control, Google’s leading scientists do not agree with him. They say Lemoine’s views are misguiding. According to them, LaMDA is simply a complex algorithm, which should sound like a convincing human language.


But the thing is that no one ones LaMDA better than Lemoine. We mean he began interacting with LaMDA as part of his job. He has been working at Google for seven years. Do you imagine what topics they have discussed and what responses he has got? It sounds like Ex Machina.

Experts say privacy laws are laggingABC Radio Perth / By Alicia BridgesPosted Sun 24 Jul 2022 at 8:32pmSunday 24 Jul 2022 at 8:32pmSun 24 Jul 2022 at 8:32pm As the use of AI in the workplace rises concerns are being raised about a lack of regulation.(Unsplash: Chris Yang)abc.net.au/news/ai-workplace-surveillance-tech-raises-concerns/101263028Copy linkLink copiedShareShare articleThe emergence of artificial intelligence that uses cameras to check for health and safety breaches in the workplace has raised concerns about a creeping culture of workplace surveillance and a lack of protections for workers.  Key points:AI can use cameras to monitor workplaces for health and safety violations and hazardsOne company with Australian clients says blurring faces is among the measures taken to protect privacyExperts say Australian law is not up-to-date to sufficiently regulate the rising use of AI in the workplaceAI technology which uses CCTV cameras can be trained to identify breaches such as when a worker is not wearing gloves or a hard hat, or to identify hazards like spills.One company, Intenseye, reports having multiple Australian customers for the new technology, including a major mining company.But Nicholas Davis, professor of emerging technology at the University of Technology Sydney, said this latest use of AI raised questions about a creeping rise of a surveillance industry that relied on workers being watched constantly.""Even though this is just one small example that can be justified under certain health and safety grounds — potentially can be justified — there are probably a million other use cases where similar technology can also be justified,"" Professor Davis said.""The end result, the cumulative result of all those small changes, means that we alter our behaviour because we're constantly being assessed by cameras.""The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) said it was aware of an increasing use of technology, including AI technology, to monitor workplace behaviour.""Our office has received some enquiries and complaints in relation to workplace surveillance generally,"" the OAIC said in a statement.Company says workers are protectedAlthough artificial intelligence is already being used in Australian workplaces in many ways, pairing AI with CCTV is an emerging technology.Intenseye uses cameras to monitor facilities and provide ""real-time violation notifications"".The company said its system blurred the faces of individuals to prevent retaliation for violations and to protect the privacy of workers.YouTube AI-powered workplace safety. (YouTube: Intenseye)Intenseye customer success manager David Lemon said there had been instances where customers had asked for faces to be unblurred, or other information that he said would be an invasion of privacy.But he said the company would not provide that information.""We have built-in safety features for data regulations that we cannot or will not ever overcome,"" Mr Lemon, who is based in the United States, said.He said there was rising demand for the technology, which could be trained to identify behaviour or breaches based on the specific concerns of the employer.Alerts about violations appeared on a cloud-based digital platform, and Mr Lemon said the company had developed a new system that hid the ""human"" visual from video footage to provide only a ""stick-figure"" visual to the employer.Mr Lemon said the company was aware of its obligations to protect the privacy of employees and sought legal advice to ensure it was complying with data and privacy laws in various countries.He said the company complied with industry regulations and was audited by the AI Ethics Lab.""This is cutting edge technology, it's the frontier, it's very new,"" he said.""Even customers who have a large appetite for computer vision do have some fears just because it's change. It's new. It can often be scary.""Laws lag behind technologyProfessor Davis, who studies the regulation of technology as it relates to human rights, said the emergence of this type of technology raised questions about consent, safety culture, and employer responsibility in the case of AI mistakes.Although companies could take measures to ensure ethical use of AI, he said Australia's surveillance laws were not equipped to effectively regulate the use of it or define what its limitations should be.Privacy watchdog investigates facial recognition in storesA report from consumer advocacy group CHOICE prompts the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner to investigate Kmart and Bunnings.Read more""It doesn't anticipate things like breakthroughs in machine learning,"" he said.The Privacy Act 1988 is currently being reviewed by the federal government, with the emergence of AI technologies listed as one of the reasons behind the review.The Act currently does not specifically address workplace surveillance, though it does require employers to give notice if they intended to collect personal information.Professor Davis is part of a team at UTS, including former Human Rights Commissioner Ed Santow, working on a model law to regulate the use of facial recognition technology.""There is a recognition or realisation that we do need much more dynamic, flexible, and appropriate fit-for purpose regulation for these kinds of technologies,"" he said.""I do think that employers increasingly have to be very rigorous and skeptical, and challenging about products that are marketed to them [where] it's not quite clear how they work.""I think we're increasingly going down a path where boards will be held to account for the mistakes made by automated systems, using machine learning and other forms of artificial intelligence.""Cameras are here to stayThe Department of Industry, Science and Resources has developed an Artificial Intelligence Ethics Framework for businesses to test AI systems against a set of ethical principles.But economist and director of the Centre of Future Work at the Australia Institute Jim Stanford said the lack of regulation was open to abuse and misuse.""You have to have legal protection, you have to have enforcement, you have to have monitoring of the monitors,"" he said.AI can help you speak to the deadWould you use AI to hear the voice of your loved one again?Read moreMr Stanford, who co-authored a report on electronic monitoring and surveillance in Australian workplaces, said employers must also consider the health and behavioural impacts of constantly being monitored.""If people feel they're being monitored all the time they're going to do everything they can to try and keep the boss happy,"" he said.""That in and of itself can lead to speed up and intensification of work that is bad for health in the long run.""Mr Stanford said he was not opposed to having video cameras in the workplace, and that the use of them was already widespread.""The question is 'how is that used? And what type of protections do people have?'"" he said.""And this is where Australia's regulatory regime is badly, badly lagging the technology.""We have to first of all map out principles regarding what is fair and what is prone to abuse.""Find more local newsBrowse for your location and find more local ABC News and informationPosted 24 Jul 202224 Jul 2022Sun 24 Jul 2022 at 8:32pmShareCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Related StoriesAre Australians sleep-walking their way into mass surveillance?Kmart and Bunnings face privacy probe after backlash against instore facial recognition technologyThat selfie you posted can be used to train machines — which might not be a bad thingMore on:Artificial IntelligencePerthPrivacyWorkplace Accidents and IncidentsTop StoriesHow a bug in a little-known piece of software caused a global meltdown‘Nothing like this has ever happened before’: Australians reflect on chaotic IT outageAustralians have been hit by a worldwide tech outage.

The companies have cited a 2021 EdScoop survey that found 69% of the higher education officials and IT decision-makers surveyed sensed increasing demand for graduates with AI technical skills, but only 45% of the respondents said their institution offers any type of AI technical course, certification or degree program. How will Stark State use the grant money?Eneix, who has been with Stark State for 25 years, said the grant will allow the college of nearly 15,000 credit-seeking students to begin incorporating aspects of artificial intelligence training into its curriculum, particularly in its computer science and engineering programs where some courses already discuss the theory of AI.She said the college plans to utilize Intel’s free AI training curriculum and will offer access to AI resources through a virtual lab. She said two faculty members already have undergone training that focused on using Intel’s AI curriculum and how to teach other trainers how to use it.Eneix said Stark State has multiple meetings scheduled with officials from Intel and the American Association of Community Colleges over the next few weeks to finalize plans on how the college will structure its programming — whether artificial intelligence training will augment existing courses or be separated into its own course. She said the course material would not be ready for fall.Stark State has until May to spend the grant money.Other colleges receiving the grant were Austin Community College, Texas; BridgeValley Community and Technical College, West Virginia; Broward College, Florida; Edmonds College, Washington; Grand Rapids Community College, Michigan; Houston Community College/Houston Community College Foundation, Texas; Howard Community College, Maryland; Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College, Mississippi; Ocean County College, New Jersey; Rockland Community College, New York; Southeast Community College, Nebraska; Tulsa Community College, Oklahoma; Umpqua Community College, Oregon and Wayne Community College, North Carolina.Reach Kelli at 330-580-8339 or kelli.weir@cantonrep.com.On Twitter: @kweirREPAmazon's Worst Nightmare: Thousands Canceling Prime for This Clever Hack (It's Unbelievable)This simple trick can save tons of money on Amazon, but most Prime members are ignoring it.Online Shopping Tools | AdAdUndoThese Barefoot Shoes are Leaving Neuropathy Experts BaffledBarefoot Vitality | AdAdBuy NowUndoAmazon's Worst Nightmare: Thousands Canceling Prime for This Clever HackThis simple trick can save tons of money on Amazon, but most Prime members are ignoring it.Coupon Code Finder | AdAdUndoHere's What A New Gutter System Should Cost You In 2024Leaf Filter USA | AdAdLearn MoreUndoCostco Shoppers Say This Wrinkle Cream Is ""Actually Worth It""""My Skin Is Smooth And My Age Spots Are Fading""The Skincare Magazine | AdAdUndo2 Cards Charging 0% Interest Until Nearly 2026With no annual fee and no interest until nearly 2026, this card is helping Americans pay off debt in record time.CompareCredit | AdAdUndoAmazon Hates When Seniors Do This, But Can't Stop You (It's Genius)Think you're getting the best deal when you shop online?
