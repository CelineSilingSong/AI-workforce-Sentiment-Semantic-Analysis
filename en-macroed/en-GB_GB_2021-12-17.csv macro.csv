Peer Review reports

Glossary of terms in the context of systematic reviews
Active machine-learning: An iterative process whereby the accuracy of the predictions made by the algorithm is improved through interaction with reviewers as they screen additional records [1].Artificial intelligence: Simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions [2].Level 2 automation: Tools enable workflow prioritization, e.g., prioritization of relevant abstracts; however, this does not reduce the work time for reviewers on the task but does allow for compression of the calendar time of the entire process [3].Level 4 automation: Tools perform tasks to eliminate the need for human participation in the task altogether, e.g., fully automated article screening decision about relevance made by the automated system [3].Reviewer compatibility: A setting in systematic review software that allows you to restrict certain users from screening each other’s records. For example, if Reviewer A and Reviewer B are restricted, if Reviewer A screens a record, it will be removed from the list of records for Reviewer B. You may also assign a certain range of reference identification numbers to reviewers. These settings will ensure that two junior reviewers will not screen the same records.Stakeholders: A person or group with a vested interest in a particular clinical decision and the evidence that supports that decision. For example, local government, or health insurance groups [4].Training set: A set of records which contribute to the active machine-learning algorithm.
Introduction Systematic reviews (SRs) are one type of review in the spectrum of knowledge synthesis products. Other examples include overview of reviews, rapid reviews, and scoping reviews [5]. SRs are the cornerstone of evidence-based medicine [6], supporting clinical decision-making such as through use in guidelines, and informing policy decisions [7]. However, SRs are time-consuming and there is growing demand by stakeholders to produce evidence more quickly, while maintaining robust methods.In performing a SR, several methods may be employed to screen records at the title and abstract level. In alignment with current recommendations for SR conduct, screening is typically performed by two reviewers working independently, with conflicts resolved through discussion, or alternatively by consultation of a third person when consensus cannot be achieved [8]. As this approach can be especially time-consuming in the presence of large citation yields, other methods are used, for example the liberal accelerated screening strategy, in which a second reviewer screens those excluded by the first reviewer [9]. Single-reviewer screening can also be used, although when empirically evaluated, this approach may miss many relevant studies [10,11,12,13]. In one study, single reviewer screening missed an average of 13% of relevant studies among 24,942 screening decisions [11]. Other alternatives include first performing title-only screening [14, 15], and using more experienced (or expert) reviewers [16].Artificial intelligence (AI) and more specifically, active machine-learning (AML) have emerged during the past decade as an area of focus to expedite the performance of knowledge syntheses, and may offer potential value both in terms of time saved and costs averted [17]. Teams producing knowledge syntheses products (e.g., SRs) may use this feature to gain efficiencies in their work to meet the needs for rapid evidence generation. AI has recently been introduced in several SR software applications, such as Abstrackr [18], DistillerSR® [19], EPPI-Reviewer [20], Pico Portal [21], Rayyan [22], RobotAnalyst [23], and SWIFTActive-Screener [24], with a comprehensive list available at SR Toolbox (http://systematicreviewtools.com/index.php). These tools use active machine-learning (AML) to re-order (or prioritize) citations to be displayed in order from most likely to be relevant to least likely, a level 2 automation for human-computer interactions [3]. The interest in using AI to support the conduct of SRs and other types of knowledge syntheses (e.g., rapid reviews, scoping reviews) is gaining momentum. Several studies have been published since 2015 using and evaluating the use of AI and prioritized screening, many with encouraging results [10, 25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37]. For example, to identify 95% of the studies included at the title and abstract level, studies have reported a reduction in the number of records that need to be screened of 40% [32] and 47.1% [34].The development and interest in the use of AI and AML in the context of knowledge syntheses may be due to: (1) the rapid increase in research publications that has caused SR teams to experience large screening burden while conducting reviews; (2) general demand by knowledge users for shorter timelines and lower cost reviews; (3) increased demand for updating reviews and producing living reviews, which require efficiencies in the review process [38]; and (4) the push for evidence-informed decision-making, especially during emergencies (e.g., COVID-19). The use of AI may offer a multitude of potential gains relevant to stakeholders and research teams that include more timely production/delivery of preliminary findings, more efficient use of team member skills, and reduction of screening burden. To facilitate the achievement of such gains, user friendly automation technologies must be seamlessly set up with minimal disruption to processes and resources [3]. Our experiences and interactions with other research teams in the field have suggested there remains interest in the sharing of perspectives with regard to the implementation of such tools into workflow planning of knowledge synthesis.A review by O’Mara-Eves in 2015 reported that several studies evaluated machine-learning for reducing the in workload for screening records, but noted that there is little overlap between the outcomes (e.g., recall of 95% vs retrieving all relevant studies), making it difficult to conclude which approach is best [1]. More recent studies have generally concluded that full automation (level 4 automation; see Glossary of Terms) performs poorly, while semi-automation (level 2 automation) may be more reliable [10, 30, 33, 34]. Although AI is not currently suitable to fully replace humans in title and abstract screening, there is value to be gained from AI use and some basic principles for teams who produce knowledge synthesis products to adopt are needed.ObjectiveWith no current consensus on how to best use AI for study selection, and several studies published in the area performance of AI and AML [26, 27, 30,31,32, 34], many researchers are may be interested by the premise, but are uncertain as to its validity and means for operationalization. As some of the barriers to adoption of new technologies are the challenges in set-up [3], we have provided different situations and considerations for knowledge synthesis teams to consider when using AI for title and abstract screening while conducting reviews.MethodsResearch informing this guidanceWe present suggestions for implementation of AML during citation screening for knowledge syntheses based upon recent retrospective and prospective assessments we have conducted in our program of research in knowledge synthesis.Retrospective evaluation of AMLIn 2020 we presented findings from a retrospective evaluation of the AML tool for citation screening available in DistillerSR® (Evidence Partners Incorporated, Ottawa, Canada), a software tool for systematic review management, to measure its performance in terms of accuracy (to identify potentially relevant citations) and potential for time savings, and also to develop empirical experience in its use to further guide our work flow for future systematic reviews [34]. In this work, we sought to assess the impact of AML when targeting a 95% true recall rate in terms of identification of studies that progressed to Level 2 full text screening during the initial systematic review. This work measured a variety of parameters of relevance to systematic reviewers including screening hours saved (compared to a traditional screening approach) and ‘missed’ citations included in the final review. Detailed findings are described elsewhere [34], and we have also provided a tabular summary of key review characteristics and AML-related outcomes in Additional file 1. Briefly, in inspecting findings across the 10 systematic reviews that were evaluated, data were consistently supportive of strong accuracy in terms of highlighting relevant citations, as well as achieving researcher-relevant reduction in screening burden. Across the 10 reviews, in no case was a citation selected for final inclusion in any of the reviews missed for progression to full text screening in the current exercise. We point readers to the related manuscript of findings for additional detail.Prospective implementation of ALMIn addition to the above retrospective investigation, since adoption of DistillerSR®‘s AML features as part of the workflow within the research unit of team members CH and BH, the strategies described in this guidance were assessed in terms of their benefits and challenges in the context of recent knowledge syntheses related to the benefits of different primary care models for long-term care homes [39, 40], interventions to manage chronic pain in those with comorbid mental health conditions [41], interventions to reduce the risk of acute pain transitioning to chronic pain [41], the health effects of cannabis consumed by older adults [42], and interventions for management of methamphetamine disorder [43]; we provide additional information regarding these reviews in Additional file 1 to provide context for readers. Authors CH and BH have overseen the implementation of AML in these reviews, monitored their benefits and challenges, and continually refined their approach. The guidance presented has been discussed collectively amongst our co-authorship team in our efforts to enhance our use of AML in our work. Our intent in sharing these steps is to inform others seeking to implement these methods in their workflow, and we hope to pursue future discussions to continually develop this process.GuidanceSimilar to the stages of conducting a SR, we developed a seven-step framework, (Fig. 1) which provides an overview of the steps for the use of prioritized screening. This framework was based on the logical steps from communicating with stakeholders (Step 1), developing a search strategy (Step 2), and the steps leading up to making a decision on when to stop screening and what modified screening approach may be used (Step 7). As previously stated, there are several software packages which now incorporate AI tools to help with title/abstract screening. We have tried to consider the array of available tools in this document to the extent possible, as some required a paid subscription. As many members of the authorship team primarily use DistillerSR, many examples or features described may be specific to DistillerSR and may or may not be available in these other applications.Fig. 1Seven-step approach to integrating active machine-learning into title/abstract screeningFull size imageStep 1: Knowledge user/expert panel consultationThe use of AI is relatively new when conducting knowledge syntheses, and knowledge users and stakeholders of reviews may not be familiar with how AI can be integrated into the review process. Even if a review team is confident in the application of AI-informed screening while conducting a review, it is important to discuss this with stakeholders before AI is used, especially if a stop/ modified screening approach will be implemented as there is a small chance that relevant records may be missed (this is further discussed below). If the team’s intention is that all records will be screened, but AI will be used to identify the most relevant records first, it is less important to discuss this with stakeholders, as it will not impact which references will be screened. This may, however, be of interest to knowledge users, as they may have access to preliminary information and findings sooner. Any known limitations of the proposed AI approaches should also be clearly identified here to stakeholders, if known.Step 2: Developing the search strategyWhen developing search strategies, review teams often make concessions to the search during its development to balance screening volume with the risk of missing relevant studies. However, these concessions in the search strategy often removes records from the results (i.e., search yield) solely based on MeSH headings and keywords associated with the record. These omitted records are never accounted for in preparing the final report of a review. With the availability of AML, it is recommended to perform the highest quality search strategy, regardless of yield. During screening, the AML will prioritize records based on relative probability of inclusion, and any records not screened (if a stop-screening approach is used) are on file and could be accessed at any time.Step 3: Preparing the research teamIt is common to construct a review team composed of junior and senior reviewers, which can be based on prior experience with SRs, performance during pilot screening, and/or content expertise. Depending on the complexity of the review question and/or the makeup of the review team members, it is recommended that reviewer compatibility (setting a restriction in the software to ensure that certain reviewers will not be able to screen each other’s records; see Glossary of Terms) be implemented, if supported by the software package being used to manage the review. This may decrease the number of conflicts, or the number of studies that are incorrectly included/excluded by junior reviewers because of inexperience, rather than an unclear abstract. This is important as records that are incorrectly included or excluded will reduce the accuracy of the AML. If a review team is large and there are fewer senior reviewers to junior reviewers, this might create additional work for the senior reviewers, so team planning and workload of reviewers should be appropriately considered. It is also important to have a person administering the review (e.g., senior reviewer, software specialist) who understands the implications of using the AI features, how to use them appropriately, and how to determine if the AI or AML are not optimal for a particular review (e.g., a review that is answering several questions may not be optimal for AML).Step 4: Preparing your database of retrieved recordsDuplicate records and title-only records (i.e., records without an abstract) retrieved may contribute to suboptimal AML, as their presence in a database of citations opens to possibility for human reviewers to make conflicting judgements; however, we have provided suggestions for approaches that can be used to mitigate this issue.Duplicate recordsBest practice for SRs involves searching a minimum of two bibliographic databases (e.g., Medline, Embase) [8]. As a record may be indexed in multiple databases, typically a number of duplicate records are identified and need to be removed prior to screening. Deduplication will reduce the screening burden and will also lessen the chance that the same title/abstract is screened more than once, which may increase the chance for conflicting decisions. Conflicting decisions on a duplicate record will impact the accuracy of the AML.Title-only recordsRecords that have titles and no abstracts are often returned in the search results for any knowledge synthesis. Such records tend to be more difficult to screen, as there is often limited information in the title to determine relevance and inclusion status can only be determined with the full-text article. The best strategy for handling these records is not currently known, but several options can be implemented:

(1)
As title-only screening has been shown to have high recall [12, 13], screen these records in the order they appear (based on the re-ranking algorithm), with the knowledge that they may be incorrectly informing the machine-learning algorithm;


(2)
Have a response option such as ‘unclear – title-only record’ which stores these records in a neutral response category (if software supports this option). These neutral responses should not inform the machine-learning algorithm and can be re-screened later when the impact of the decisions will be less influential on the machine learning algorithm.


(3)
Isolate the records temporarily so they do not appear in the list of records for screening. This may be done several ways, depending on the features of the software you are using (e.g. assignment of a neutral tag regarding inclusion status for screening, or by temporarily quarantining the related citations). When the impact of these records will be less influential to the machine learning algorithm, they can be screened.

These options may be helpful for handling of records from clinical trial registries, which are now integrated into online databases. Although some may have an abstract, it is often not structured in the same way as commonly seen for a published study and may be difficult to determine relevance.Step 5: Building a high-quality initial training setMany of the recently introduced AI prioritization tools in SR management software use AML.There are two ways AML may be used during screening of title/abstract records:

(1)
To sort records in order of likelihood of inclusion (where likelihood is established based on scores of perceived relevance based on a training set of citations exposed to AML), while still screening all records. While this does not reduce the number of records to be screened, gains can be made as the review team gets access to the most relevant citations faster, and members of the team may be allocated more efficiently to different review stages (e.g., procurement of full-text articles, full text screening, data extraction and risk of bias appraisal), while the records more likely to be excluded can be screened by other members of the review team; and


(2)
To implement a stop-screening rule or modified screening approach, whereby a decision is made once the AI identifies that a certain threshold has been achieved (e.g., 95% estimated recall). At this threshold, the review team may choose to stop screening the remaining unscreened records or to modify how screening is performed (e.g., changing from dual independent to single screener). These approaches are further discussed below.

Records in a new database will not be shown in a prioritized order, as the AML has not yet ‘learned’ which records should be included or excluded. Reviewer decisions from a small set of records (i.e., the initial training set), whose size will vary depending on which software application is being used, will inform the AML. Once this initial training set is built/screened, the AML is activated, and records are shown to the reviewers in prioritized order. Each additional set of responses (or training sets) contributes to the AML and reshuffles, or prioritizes, the order in which the unscreened records appear to the reviewer. Therefore, the accuracy of each subsequent re-ranking and re-ordering of citations depends on the accuracy of the records already screened and included in the training set. It is particularly important that the initial training set is accurate (i.e., true includes and true excludes are identified), as any errors in screening will ‘teach’ the machine learning algorithm incorrectly.In the standard approach to SRs, review teams commonly perform a pilot screening exercise on a set number of records to calibrate team member interpretation of the screening question and to expose team members to a sample of the records. This provides the opportunity to not only pilot the screening question(s), but to build a high-quality initial training set prior to application of AI to prioritize. For example, in DistillerSR, the initial training set is built after 2% (minimum of 25 records, maximum of 200 records) of the records are screened (i.e., an include/exclude decision has been made). Therefore, the pilot exercise could be performed on 2% of the records in the database of retrieved records. In Abstrackr, prioritization is run once every 24 h, so this should be considered in project planning. In SWIFT-Active Screener, prioritization first runs after specific conditions are met and then continuously each time 30 references are screened. We suggest the following considerations for implementation of the pilot/initial training set:

Piloting. Have two (or more depending on team size) reviewers screen the same set of references independently, with the include- or exclude-decision based on the number of participating reviewers. The amount of references in this pilot set can be either a specific number of records (e.g., 50 records) or a percentage of the total number of citations. For example, in DistillerSR, a database with 7500 records will require 150 records (i.e., 2% of total records) to be screened to create the first training set. Depending on the number of screeners in a review team, they may choose to either all screen the same records (i.e., four reviewers screen the same 150 records) or to split these records between the screeners (e.g., two reviewers each screen 75 records). After these records have been screened by the review team, conflict resolution should be performed. It is possible that after the initial records are piloted that the prioritization tool has not become activated (e.g., you have piloted less than 2% of the total records) or other software requires additional records screened or the timing of prioritization is not immediate (e.g., Abstrackr ranks records once in a 24-h period). Some review teams require a specific agreement level (e.g., kappa of 0.8) to be met before piloting can be considered complete. If this is required, subsequent pilot screening may be required until this level of agreement is achieved.


Reviewer expertise. If feasible, it can be beneficial to have an expert reviewer (e.g., clinical or content expert) involved in piloting the initial training set. Experts commonly have a good grasp of the literature and can identify relevant and irrelevant records with high accuracy. This can be an excellent complement to the expertise of other reviewers and help to maximize the training of the AI early on.


Targeted screening to enhance training set. It can be highly efficient to conduct a targeted search of the records to build a more informed training set. Practically speaking, when developing a grant application or protocol for a SR and gaining expertise in a particular field, some of the relevant studies that will be included in the future review are often identified, whether through identification by participating experts, knowledge brokers, or independent searching by the review lead. Identifying other similar reviews in the area may also offer a list of potentially relevant studies. This may be especially important if the review question is on a condition/disease that is rare, and/or where few included studies may be identified. Identifying these seed articles into the training set early can prove valuable in teaching the AML and should help identify similar citations which may also be relevant.

Step 6: Ongoing screeningDepending on the software application, the AI prioritization tool will only re-order records that have been fully classified as included or excluded (i.e., no conflict), while others may inform the AML on partially screened records (e.g., SWIFTActive-Screener). The rate at which re-ordering happens varies across currently available SR management software programs. For example, in DistillerSR, after each additional 2% of the records have been fully screened, it creates an iteration, which is added to the existing training set, and generates an updated prioritized list based upon all previously screened records; there is also the option to re-rank the records at any time if you do not want to wait for 2% of the records to be screened. In SWIFTActive-Screener, the active learning model is continuously updated during screening, improving its performance with each article reviewed. Currently, Abstrackr has been designed to re-order records once every 24 h. Therefore, if reviewers screen records at a different pace, re-ranking of records will not occur for the faster reviewer until a second reviewer has screened that record, and the prioritization of records may not be optimized for the faster reviewer.To screen the remaining records, we suggest the following options, in order of methodological robustness. It should be noted that some of the features described below may not be available in all software packages.

Dual-independent (best practice). If the project schedule and timeline allow for it, it is recommended that dual-independent screening be continued, as was used in the pilot training set. However, it is recommended that additional project management be performed. For example, the project lead should implement checks throughout screening at specific intervals (e.g., at the end of each day) to ensure that reviewers are screening records at approximately the same pace to optimize performance and utility of the prioritization tool. Depending on the time availability of the reviewers, establishing daily targets for screening volume may help maintain a common pace across team members. For larger review teams, where time allocation to the project varies for different reviewers due to competing priorities, this may be burdensome and more complex to manage. Additionally, the project lead should suspend screening and have team members resolve their conflicts in cases where conflicts are occurring with some frequency. While this might take some additional time, the time saved by having an accurate training set outweighs the time you will spend screening with an inaccurate model. It might be important to inform the reviewers that records are being displayed in order of likelihood of inclusion, as they may question why they are including so many records, which is not usually the case when screening without prioritization.


Liberal accelerated screening. This requires one reviewer to include a record and two reviewers to exclude a record [9]. As records are being included by one reviewer, the prioritization tool can re-rank the records based on these decisions. The caveat for this option is that over-inclusiveness of records may decrease the accuracy of the machine learning, thereby limiting the gains in efficiency that may be achieved. For records that are in conflict (i.e., the first reviewer excluded the record and the second reviewer included the record), these should be resolved to increase the training set accuracy. This may be done at set intervals (e.g., at the end of each day). If this method is used, it is recommended that the review team is made up of experienced screeners.


Single reviewer screening. You may choose to have one reviewer (e.g., expert, senior reviewer) screen the remaining records. There is a chance for both false positives (i.e., inclusion of a record that should have been excluded) and false negatives (i.e., exclusion of a record that should have been included) using this option. False positives are less of a concern, as they will be excluded at full-text screening, however, they will impact the accuracy of the training set and prioritization of the remaining records. Although not related to AI and AML, false positive records also contribute to additional procurement costs and full-text screening burden. DistillerSR® includes an AI simulation tool which helps identify potential false positives. False negatives are more concerning, as these would be removed from any further screening. Depending on the software, it is possible to mitigate some of this risk by regularly running an audit of the excluded records. For example, in DistillerSR®, there is an AI audit tool which assigns a prediction score to excluded records with inclusion characteristics and displays this list to the reviewers to double-check exclusion. This may be performed at set intervals (e.g., 5–10% of records, once per day). Resolving incorrect includes and excludes regularly means your reviewers are always screening the most likely includes and will identify these relevant records sooner.

Step 7: Truncation of screeningAlthough there is little empirical evidence to support a modified-screening or stop-screening approach, review teams might choose to stop or modify how they have been screening once a particular threshold has been met. There are several straightforward stopping rules which may be implemented, including stopping once a certain number of irrelevant records are reviewed consecutively (i.e., a heuristic approach) and stopping at a particular point due to time constraints (i.e., pragmatic approach). However, the reliability and accuracy of these methods remains uncertain. There have also been some more complex evaluations to implement a stopping decision [44]. For example, a review team may decide to stop screening once a specific percentage of the predicted relevant references has been identified (e.g., estimated recall of 95%). As not all records would have been screened at this point, the percentage would be based on the estimated recall, which may or may not be equal to the true recall. Recall is calculated as [True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)]. Therefore, if we do not know the value of the True Positives, because we have not screened all records, then we have an estimated recall value. The number of false negatives can be decreased by using the audit tool. There is evidence to support that the estimated recall is in fact a conservative estimate of the true recall [32].Once the modified/stop-screening criterion has been met, there are several options on what screening method(s) can be used with the remaining records. Table 1 presents the options to screen the remaining records. This list is presented in order from the highest risk of missing a relevant record to least risk. Different approaches may be taken as additional screening has been performed, as the likelihood of inclusion of the remaining references decreases with each iteration.Table 1 Screening optionsFull size tableGeneral screening process flowThe previous section described the guidance and considerations from knowledge user consultation through to truncation of screening. We provide here a general screening process flow diagram which provides a pictorial representation of the title and abstract screening process using AML (Fig. 2). As mentioned in the preceding section, some features may not be available in all software applications (e.g., audit), but other processes remain the same.Fig. 2Integration of AI into the overall title and abstract screening processFull size imageInappropriate use of AI during screeningReview teams might be tempted to develop a training set with a pre-specified set of records (e.g., 200 records), then assign the AI reviewer to have the ability to make include and exclude decisions based on the predicted score (e.g., include those with a score of 0.5 and higher, and exclude the remaining records). Scores assigned by the classifiers may be highly specific to the project and are only useful in relation to the scores of other references. As mentioned earlier, studies that have evaluated this level of automation (level 4) have reported poor performance [10, 30] and this approach should be avoided.DiscussionWe present guidance for the use of AI and AML during title and abstract screening based on common questions that review teams may encounter while deciding to use (or not use) this approach, and outline effective, lower risk practices for using AI. This work was motivated by our own past hesitation to explore AI methods for work in our field, as well as discussions with our peers who have similarly wondered how to introduce efficiencies from AI into their work while minimizing risk of biases and maximizing an approach that aligns with their current approach. As most research in this area is based on a small number of case studies [30] or small datasets [33], it is important for knowledge synthesis teams to test prioritization tools in their own projects, and we encourage replication to build to the repository of information.Transparent reporting is critical for any research team conducting primary studies and knowledge syntheses products (e.g., systematic review, scoping review). The Enhancing the QUality and Transparency Of health Research (EQUATOR) network provides researchers with 452 reporting guidelines for all research types, and 43 reporting guidelines specific to SRs/Meta-analyses/Overviews/Health Technology Assessments/Reviews (as of February 2021) [45]. Updates to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement have included requirements for reporting around the use of automation tools with a list of ‘essential elements for systematic reviews using automation tools in the selection process’ [46]; we feel this to be a sign of growing acceptance of the use of AI in the field of knowledge synthesis that should encourage those interested to adopt these tools into their research approach. Transparent and consistent reporting will help determine which title and abstract screening methods were applied when conducting the review, which will allow for replicability, and ultimately allow for conclusions to be made on best approaches and to address concerns of stakeholders [47].Implications for future researchStudy design of inclusion may impact performance of AML, as RCTs may have better reported abstracts than observational studies, as there is guidance on what should be reported in RCT abstracts [48]. Future research can examine how study design (e.g., RCT vs observation) impact performance, if any. The type of review may also impact performance. For example, an overview of reviews includes SRs as the unit of inclusion, and a scoping review may have a broader scope that a more focused SR. For a review that aims to answer multiple questions, the value of creating separate searches or projects within the software application should be evaluated. In our work, we commonly apply AML separately to citations organized by design, which may be helpful for readers. Our prospective assessments have involved use in large rapid and scoping reviews, and benefits of AML for screening have continued to be considerable.Stopping or the modifying screening process after the identification of a recall of 95% presented here is the value has that been evaluated in the literature using various software applications. To date, these are based on a small number of reviews. There is an advantage to having a broader number of reviews per primary study and additional evaluative studies to contribute to the overall evidence base. This may contribute to overlapping methodologies and increase the sample size for each methodology evaluated.LimitationsOne of the difficulties of providing guidance for using AI and AML for title and abstract screening is the rapidly evolving nature of machine learning tools. However, until a time that these tools can fully replace humans, a standard set of methodologies and evaluations will be beneficial to the knowledge synthesis community. Additionally, there are several SR software applications, both freely available and at a cost, which provide different features. Not all guidance and recommendations provided in this manuscript will be applicable to all software applications. It is recommended that users visit the specific websites of these tools to help determine if a particular software contains specific features, as software development may be ongoing and new features made available. We acknowledge that our guidance for use has been based on our own experiences using DistillerSR, a product with which we have considerable expertise through our own use during our past decade of research; we provide the current set of guidance with the objective of helping others based on our own experiences and research.ConclusionsAML is a well-developed tool for title and abstract screening and has the potential to reduce the amount of time spent screening titles and abstracts, and may help make optimal use of review team members. There are several ways AI and AML can be integrated into the screening process, and this document has provided a set of recommendations and guidance around its integration. Regardless of the method chosen, transparent reporting of these methods are critical for future studies evaluating AI and AML.

“The fabric of the future of work”

Key points

Safety-related AI offerings include continuous observation, deeper insights and real-time alerts for both employers and workers.
Employers can help alleviate concerns over privacy and other issues workers may have by giving them a “seat at the table” when these technologies are introduced, as well as being transparent about the use of AI.
AI requires the expertise of safety professionals to ensure it’s effective and continues to capture useful data.


Artificial intelligence already is part of our everyday lives: in our web searches, in our interactions with digital assistants, and even helping us decide what movies and TV shows to watch.
In the world of worker safety, AI is providing “great opportunities.” That’s according to Jay Vietas, chief of the emerging technologies branch of the NIOSH Division of Science Integration. 

Vietas

“Not only will it be in the fabric of the future of work, but it’s going to be in the fabric of solutions to the future of work as well,” Vietas said during a webinar hosted by the agency in June. 
Some of the benefits AI is providing to the safety field: deeper insights, continuous observations and real-time alerts to help employees avoid unsafe situations and organizations respond to incidents quicker. 
Experts say making use of AI requires collaborative efforts between safety professionals and other departments, namely information technology, to ensure transparency as well as alleviate privacy concerns and other issues workers may have. 

Darabi

“Our recommendation is, basically, try to understand AI and try to see how it can work for you,” said Houshang Darabi, a professor at the University of Illinois Chicago and co-director of the occupational safety program at the school’s Great Lakes Center for Occupational Health and Safety.


Associate Editor Alan Ferguson  discusses this article in the Jan. 2021 episode of Safety+Health's “On the Safe Side” podcast.


Some uses of AI
AI is defined as the use of computers and/or machines to try to replicate human decision-making, problem-solving and other abilities.
“AI works by combining large amounts of data with fast, iterative processing and intelligent algorithms, allowing the software to learn automatically from patterns or features in the data,” according to software company SAS. 
Subsets of AI include machine learning, neural networks, computer vision and natural language processing. 

Hornsby

One safety-related example is the use of cameras that can detect whether workers are wearing their personal protective equipment. Specifically, the devices can monitor employees who are working at height and need to be wearing harnesses. Not only can the cameras detect whether the workers are wearing their harness, but they also can identify if the PPE is tethered, said Donavan Hornsby, corporate development and strategy officer with Benchmark Digital Partners and the Benchmark ESG digital platform.
During a technical session at the 2021 NSC Safety Congress & Expo, Hornsby and Dave Roberts, vice president of environmental, health and safety at The Heico Cos., offered other examples of tasks that AI-enabled cameras can perform. These include tracking interactions between workers and machinery, monitoring the status of machine guarding, checking if workers are in or outside of designated areas, and performing ergonomic assessments. The devices also can be paired with sensors or wearables that are attached to hard hats, vests or other items. 
That continuous eye on workers means that safety pros don’t have to rely solely on observations, walkarounds or inspections to ensure workers are wearing PPE or to identify other safety issues.
“Instead of depending on one person doing their round once a shift or once a day,” Hornsby said, “what if the cameras are always looking and that person can now spend time working on more value-added activities?”

Learn more
This spring, the University of Illinois Chicago will offer an online course to help occupational safety and health professionals learn more about artificial intelligence. For more information, email Preethi Pratap at plakshmi@uic.edu.

Heat mapping and fatigue monitoring
Cameras and/or sensors and wearables also have the ability to generate heat maps, which can show where high-risk activities are taking place in a facility.
It’s important, Hornsby noted, to layer that data with operational data for greater knowledge and analysis.
“Then you have this kind of multilayer perspective on risk: high-risk operations, people that are working long hours, high concentrations of activity,” he said.
For employees working long hours, Hornsby said certain AI-enabled programs can help measure cognitive impairment. That can come in the form of, say, a 30-second visual puzzle. With an established baseline for each worker, the cognitive screening can test personnel before each shift. 
“They can get a sense of whether or not they’re cognitively impaired,” Hornsby said, “which may have been a result of working too long of a shift the day before or not getting enough sleep or personal issues, or whatever the case might be.”

AI should be used for monitoring noise levels or dust levels rather than keeping eye on PPE use. Workplace environment pollution in violation of legally stipulated limits or workers working long hours is a great hazard and AI can be trained to report on such violations also

Moderna recently announced the launch of its Artificial Intelligence Academy. Partnering with Carnegie Mellon University, the AI Academy is intended to educate employees in integrating AI and machine learning solutions into the Moderna system.







“Moderna is advancing mRNA medicines at a breadth, speed and scale that is uncommon in the biopharmaceutical industry, and we attribute this speed in part to the incorporation of digital technologies in our company,” said the CEO of Moderna Stéphane Bancel in a press release.
 According to Bancel, looking at the next 10–20 years, the company believes that there will be a lot to learn regarding improving patient outcomes and maximizing the impact of mRNA technologies.
“We believe AI is a key enabler of our ability to build the best version of Moderna now and into the future. This AI academy will enable us to make AI part of the company’s ways of working, part of our DNA. We look forward to driving this with Carnegie Mellon’s team,” Bancel said.
CMU’s Department of Statistics & Data Science and the Tepper School of Business are collaborating with professors across the university to develop the AI Academy. The program will feature a tailored curriculum for working professionals focused on data quality, data visualization, statistical models, machine learning algorithms, and AI ethics.
The content will assist all Moderna employees to think strategically about how to leverage AI in their specific job functions. The AI Academy will connect Moderna staff directly to CMU faculty members both in-person and online using the Integrated Statistics Learning Environment (ISLE), an interactive educational platform developed at the university.
According to the US News & World Report rankings, CMU is the top university for graduate education in AI and computer science.
“We are excited to deliver a world-class AI curriculum to Moderna and support the company’s deep-rooted commitment to discovery and innovation that protects public health,” said CMU President Farnam Jahanian.
“With decades-long leadership in the field, Carnegie Mellon is uniquely positioned to help businesses learn how to use AI to drive the kinds of breakthroughs needed to address urgent societal challenges. It’s rewarding to partner with a pioneering biotech company that is dedicated to adapting its business and its workforce to this critical technology.”
With the strategic partnership, Moderna employees will be provided with the skills and education to deliver improved AI capabilities, investing in a digital-first culture. Moderna is planning for a full rollout of the program in early 2022.

These opposing forces in turn make it difficult to implement AI-based HR tools in an effective and responsible way.AI-based HR tools come in a wide range of forms, aiming to take on some aspect of HR work such as hiring, training, benefits, or employee engagement. They can be oversold when their creators rely on the aura and mystery surrounding AI to promote their product, furthering the belief that AI is all-powerful and incomprehensible to the average person.Have you read?Will a 'hybrid' model work for your organization? This technology can tell youHow to use AI hiring tools to reduce bias in recruitingCan artificial intelligence help close gender gaps at work?At the same time, the use of AI in HR raises concerns given AI’s potential for problems in areas such as data privacy and bias. These concerns are amplified in the HR context where decisions can have significant impacts of people’s lives. While the need for caution when deploying AI-based HR is well-justified, we should also acknowledge problems with the status quo, including well-documented patterns of bias as well as over-reliance on gut decisions. Too much fear of AI in HR will lead us to miss real opportunities to make HR processes fairer and more effective.How can we promote the responsible use of AI-based tools in human resources?For the past two years, I have been leading the World Economic Forum’s Human-Centred AI for HR project, where I have had the opportunity to work with over 50 experts from HR, data science, employment law, and ethics. Our project community included members with a wide range of views, but with a common desire to see a more thoughtful and responsible use of AI in this field. The end result was a toolkit for HR professionals, translating the broad principles of AI ethics into practical guidance.We learned many important lessons along the way, as documented in the toolkit and accompanying white paper Human-Centred Artificial Intelligence for Human Resources: A Toolkit for Human Resources Professionals. But one area was unexpectedly challenging: an AI principle that is particularly salient in the HR context is the belief that humans should continue to have the final say in high-stakes decisions, in essence “keeping the human in Human Resources”. While there is widespread agreement on this AI principle, it can be surprisingly difficult to put this principle into practice.The experiences of our project community members suggested that the users of AI-based HR tools tend drift toward two extremes. On the one extreme are users who accept the recommendations of the tool without question, buying into the powerful AI aura. On the other extreme are users who fear and distrust AI systems, leading them to ignore their recommendations or actively fight against the use of the tool altogether. Simply telling the user to make the final decision also risks reintroducing the problems of the status quo that the AI-based tools were aiming to address.Source: World Economic Forum.Keeping humans truly in charge of AI-based HR tools, therefore, is critically important but requires effort in three areas: bringing together and equipping people with the necessary skills; dispelling the AI aura; and establishing the necessary organizational infrastructure.1. Involve multiple stakeholders and equip them with the necessary skillsOvercoming the fear of AI in HR requires involving multiple stakeholders in the process of selecting and adopting AI-based HR tools, including HR professionals as well as the workers who will be impacted by such tools. Furthermore, everyone should be encouraged to learn the basics of how AI systems work. Contrary to expectations, these basics are relatively easy to grasp (the toolkit provides more details, but the most important fact to know is that current AI systems are developed by looking for patterns in real-world data).Armed with this basic understanding, a multi-stakeholder group of individuals can prove to be a more valuable resource for deciding on an AI-based HR tool than a data scientist or IT specialist. Technical experts are of course also valuable, but the multi-stakeholder group brings an understanding of how the organization actually works, what changes are needed to the status quo, and what is (and what is not) captured in the data that the AI systems will be using. This greater involvement and understanding will lead to both the better selection of AI-based HR tools that fit with the organization, as well as more informed and less fearful users.2. Provide a balanced understanding of AI toolsThe creators of AI-based HR tools, meanwhile, should move away from selling AI as a mysterious and powerful tool and toward emphasizing thoughtful, understandable, and trustworthy designs. Not only is this the more responsible path, but with growing concerns around the potential ethical and legal challenges of AI in HR, organizations are increasingly valuing this approach.A tool that is clear about how it works, provides explanations for its recommendations, and is less grandiose in its claims will provide organizations and users with a better understanding of how the recommendations generated by the AI algorithm can be combined with human input and oversight in an effective way.3. Establish an organizational infrastructureFinally, organizations should recognize that the effective use of AI-based HR tools requires considerable planning, with a key aspect of that planning centering on the human-AI relationship. One aspect of this planning includes ensuring that the previous two steps are taken: that users have an adequate input into and understanding of the AI system, and that the tool being used is transparent and understandable. In addition, organizations need to give considerable thought and guidance on how employees should use the tool and combine its use with their own insights and judgements.Harnessing the power of AI in human resourcesSimply stating that the human will have the final say in a high-stakes decision is not sufficient. If users lack confidence or trust, the AI system is too opaque, or organizations are vague in how this process should work, the use of AI-based HR tools will slide toward the extremes of either the algorithm or the human having sole control. Both algorithmic and human decisions are imperfect, but with a clear understanding of those imperfections, careful thought, and purposeful practices organizations can work toward systems that instead build on the strengths of humans and machines to realize the full potential of AI in HR.Accept our marketing cookies to access this content.These cookies are currently disabled in your browser.Accept cookiesDon't miss any update on Artificial IntelligenceSign up for free and access the latest publications and insights across various topics.Sign up for freeLicense and RepublishingWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.The views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.Related topics:Emerging TechnologiesJobs and the Future of WorkFourth Industrial RevolutionShare:Global AgendaThe Agenda WeeklyA weekly update of the most important issues driving the global agendaSubscribe todayYou can unsubscribe at any time using the link in our emails.

The Research Brief is a short take about interesting academic work.
The big idea
A unique material, nickel oxide demonstrates the ability to learn things about its environment in a way that emulates the most basic learning abilities of animals, as my colleagues and I describe in a new paper.
For over half a century, neuroscientists have studied sea slugs to understand basic animal learning. Two fundamental concepts of learning are habituation and sensitization. Habituation occurs when an organism’s response to a repeated stimulus continuously decreases. When researchers first touch a sea slug, its gills retract. But the more they touch the slug, the less it retracts its gills. Sensitization is an organism’s extreme reaction to a harmful or unexpected stimulus. If researchers then shock a sea slug, it will retract its gills much more dramatically than when it was merely touched. This is sensitization. 



When nickel oxide is alternately bathed in hydrogen gas and air, its behavior changes.

Nickel oxide has features that are strikingly similar to this learning behavior. Instead of gills retracting, we measured the change in electrical conductivity of the material. The stimulus, instead of a finger poke, was repeatedly alternating the environment of the nickel oxide between normal air and hydrogen gas.
Nickel oxide is interesting because when you expose it to hydrogen gas, its crystalline structure subtly changes and more electrons become available to generate an electrical current. In our experiment, we kept switching between the hydrogen-only and regular air environments. You would expect the electrical conductivity to oscillate up and down directly in relation to the exposure to hydrogen or air. But just as with the sea slugs, the change in conductivity of the nickel oxide slowly went down the more we stimulated it. It got habituated to the hydrogen.
When we exposed the material to bright light or ozone, though, it rapidly changed its conductivity – the same way a slug will always respond dramatically to a small shock.



The conductivity of nickel oxide stores information similarly to the way slugs learn.

Why it matters
The ability to learn, remember or forget information as needed is a powerful skill for any animal or machine. So far, the vast majority of research in the field of artificial intelligence has focused on software-based approaches to machine learning, with far less effort dedicated to studying the learning abilities of materials.
At the center of these two related areas of research lies the field of brain-inspired computers.  For intelligence to be encoded into hardware, scientists need semiconductors that can learn from past experience and adapt to dynamic environments in a physical way similar to that of neurons in animal brains. Our new research showing how nickel oxide demonstrates features of learning hints at how this or similar materials could serve as building blocks for computers of the future. 
What still isn’t known
Before such materials can be incorporated into computer chips there are some knowledge gaps that need to be addressed. For instance, it is not yet clear at what time scales a material needs to learn for it to be useful in electrical systems. How quickly does something need to learn or forget to be useful? Another unknown is how or whether it is possible to change the structure of nickel oxide to produce different learning behaviors.



It is unclear whether nickel oxide itself can be used for computing, but the concepts at play could inspire further innovation.

What’s next
In addition to further experiments on the material itself, there are theoretical lessons to explore. Observations of collective behavior of animals in nature – such as bird flocks and schools of fish – have inspired researchers to develop fields of AI like swarm intelligence. In a similar fashion, the interesting collective motion of atoms and electrons in materials could inspire AI and hardware design in the future. 
As new materials that can accommodate mobile atoms are discovered, I am optimistic we will see further breakthroughs that can bring researchers one step closer to designing computers that emulate animal brains.

The faces of Jesus and Mary reconstructed with artificial intelligence
 


Da David Sabbatini - December 17, 2021



In 2020 and 2021, the results of two technology-based studies and research on the Holy Shroud they have had repercussions around the world.
There are countless attempts to rebuild the faces of Jesus and Mary throughout history, but, in 2020 and 2021, the results of two works based on artificial intelligence software and research on the Holy Shroud of Turin have had worldwide resonance.
The face of Christ

The Dutch artist Bas Uterwijk presented, in 2020, his reconstruction of the face of Jesus Christ, made using the neural software Artbreeder, which applies artificial intelligence to a previously provided data set. With this technique, Uterwijk portrays historical characters and even ancient monuments, trying to achieve the most realistic results possible.
Despite the pursuit of realism as a general guideline, the artist pointed out, in statements to the British Daily Mail, that he considers his work more like art than science: “I try to drive the software to get a credible result. I think of my work more as an artistic interpretation than as historically and scientifically accurate images ”.
In 2018 the Italian researcher Julius Fanti, professor of mechanical and thermal measurements at the University of Padua and scholar of the Holy Shroud, had also presented a three-dimensional reconstruction of the physiognomy of Jesus, based on studies of the mysterious relic preserved in Turin.
The face of Mary

In November 2021, the Brazilian professor and designer Átila Soares from Costa Filho presented the results of four months of studies to try to achieve what would have been the physiognomy of the mother of Jesus. He also used the latest imaging and artificial intelligence technologies, as well as drawing on data obtained from extensive human research of the Holy Shroud of Turin.
Átila himself reported, in an exclusive interview with the journalist Ricardo Sanches, of Aleteia Português, that among his main foundations were the studios of the American designer Ray Downing, who, in 2010, was involved in a project with the most advanced technology. discover the true face of man on the Shroud.
""To this day, Downing's results are considered the most authentic and welcome of all attempts ever made,"" notes Attila, who, therefore, took that face as a basis and conducted experiments with artificial intelligence software and systems. high-tech neural networks, convolutional mechanisms for gender change. Finally, he used other facial retouching and manual artistic retouching programs applied to define an ethnically and anthropologically feminine physiognomy of 2000-year-old Palestine, while avoiding compromising what artificial intelligence had already provided.
The result was a surprising reconstruction of the face of the Blessed Virgin Mary in her adolescence.
Attila's project conclusions were endorsed by the world's greatest researcher and lecturer Barrie M. Schwortz, official photographer of the historian Project Sturp. At his invitation, the experiment was entered into the portal Shroud. com, which is the largest and most important source of information on the Holy Shroud ever compiled - and of which Swortz is the founder and administrator.
Attempts to reconstruct the faces of Jesus and Mary fuel relevant historical, scientific and theological debates and, at times, reactions of surprise and controversy.
