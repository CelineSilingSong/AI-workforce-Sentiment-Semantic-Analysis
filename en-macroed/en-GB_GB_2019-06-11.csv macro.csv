Much as robots have transformed entire swaths of the manufacturing economy, artificial intelligence and automation are now changing information work, letting humans offload cognitive labor to computers. In journalism, for instance, data mining systems alert reporters to potential news stories, while newsbots offer new ways for audiences to explore information. Automated writing systems generate financial, sports and elections coverage. 
A common question as these intelligent technologies infiltrate various industries is how work and labor will be affected. In this case, who – or what – will do journalism in this AI-enhanced and automated world, and how will they do it?
The evidence I assembled in my 2019 book “Automating the News: How Algorithms are Rewriting the Media” suggests that the future of AI-enabled journalism will still have plenty of people around. However, the jobs, roles and tasks of those people will evolve and look a bit different. Human work will be hybridized – blended together with algorithms – to suit AI’s capabilities and accommodate its limitations.
Augmenting, not substituting
Some estimates suggest that current levels of AI technology could automate only about 15% of a reporter’s job and 9% of an editor’s job. Humans still have an edge over non-Hollywood AI in several key areas that are essential to journalism, including complex communication, expert thinking, adaptability and creativity.
Reporting, listening, responding and pushing back, negotiating with sources, and then having the creativity to put it together – AI can do none of these indispensable journalistic tasks. It can often augment human work, though, to help people work faster or with improved quality. And it can create new opportunities for deepening news coverage and making it more personalized for an individual reader or viewer.
Newsroom work has always adapted to waves of new technology, including photography, telephones, computers – or even just the copy machine. Journalists will adapt to work with AI, too. As a technology, it is already and will continue to change newswork, often complementing but rarely substituting for a trained journalist.
New work
I’ve found that more often than not, AI technologies appear to actually be creating new types of work in journalism.
Take for instance the Associated Press, which in 2017 introduced the use of computer vision AI techniques to label the thousands of news photos it handles every day. The system can tag photos with information about what or who is in an image, its photographic style, and whether an image is depicting graphic violence. 
The system gives photo editors more time to think about what they should publish and frees them from spending lots of time just labeling what they have. But developing it took a ton of work, both editorial and technical: Editors had to figure out what to tag and whether the algorithms were up to the task, then develop new test data sets to evaluate performance. When all that was done, they still had to supervise the system, manually approving the suggested tags for each image to ensure high accuracy.
Stuart Myles, the AP executive who oversees the project, told me it took about 36 person-months of work, spread over a couple of years and more than a dozen editorial, technical and administrative staff. About a third of the work, he told me, involved journalistic expertise and judgment that is especially hard to automate. While some of the human supervision  may be reduced in the future, he thinks that people will still need to do ongoing editorial work as the system evolves and expands. 
Semi-automated content production
In the United Kingdom, the RADAR project semi-automatically pumps out around 8,000 localized news articles per month. The system relies on a stable of six journalists who find government data sets tabulated by geographic area, identify interesting and newsworthy angles, and then develop those ideas into data-driven templates. The templates encode how to automatically tailor bits of the text to the geographic locations identified in the data. For instance, a story could talk about aging populations across Britain, and show readers in Luton how their community is changing, with different localized statistics for Bristol. The stories then go out by wire service to local media who choose which to publish. 
The approach marries journalists and automation into an effective and productive process. The journalists use their expertise and communication skills to lay out options for storylines the data might follow. They also talk to sources to gather national context, and write the template. The automation then acts as a production assistant, adapting the text for different locations.
RADAR journalists use a tool called Arria Studio, which offers a glimpse of what writing automated content looks like in practice. It’s really just a more complex interface for word processing. The author writes fragments of text controlled by data-driven if-then-else rules. For instance, in an earthquake report you might want a different adjective to talk about a quake that is magnitude 8 than one that is magnitude 3. So you’d have a rule like, IF magnitude > 7 THEN text = “strong earthquake,” ELSE IF magnitude < 4 THEN text = “minor earthquake.” Tools like Arria also contain linguistic functionality to automatically conjugate verbs or decline nouns, making it easier to work with bits of text that need to change based on data.

Authoring interfaces like Arria allow people to do what they’re good at: logically structuring compelling storylines and crafting creative, nonrepetitive text. But they also require some new ways of thinking about writing. For instance, template writers need to approach a story with an understanding of what the available data could say – to imagine how the data could give rise to different angles and stories, and delineate the logic to drive those variations.
Supervision, management or what journalists might call “editing” of automated content systems are also increasingly occupying people in the newsroom. Maintaining quality and accuracy is of the utmost concern in journalism. 
RADAR has developed a three-stage quality assurance process. First, a journalist will read a sample of all of the articles produced. Then another journalist traces claims in the story back to their original data source. As a third check, an editor will go through the logic of the template to try to spot any errors or omissions. It’s almost like the work a team of software engineers might do in debugging a script – and it’s all work humans must do, to ensure the automation is doing its job accurately.
Developing human resources
Initiatives like those at the Associated Press and at RADAR demonstrate that AI and automation are far from destroying jobs in journalism. They’re creating new work – as well as changing existing jobs. The journalists of tomorrow will need to be trained to design, update, tweak, validate, correct, supervise and generally maintain these systems. Many may need skills for working with data and formal logical thinking to act on that data. Fluency with the basics of computer programming wouldn’t hurt either.
As these new jobs evolve, it will be important to ensure they’re good jobs – that people don’t just become cogs in a much larger machine process. Managers and designers of this new hybrid labor will need to consider the human concerns of autonomy, effectiveness and usability. But I’m optimistic that focusing on the human experience in these systems will allow journalists to flourish, and society to reap the rewards of speed, breadth of coverage and increased quality that AI and automation can offer.

Artificial intelligence: the new electricity

June  2019

   
   
   
   




By Catherine Jewell, Publications Division, WIPO
The British-born computer scientist, Andrew Ng, is a leading thinker on artificial intelligence (AI) and has been a pioneer in its application for many years. He founded the Google Brain project, served as Chief Scientist at Baidu, and co-founded the online learning platform, Coursera. Today, in addition to his academic work at Stanford University (USA), Mr. Ng is heading up two startups: Landing AI, which works with enterprises to adopt AI, and deeplearning.ai, an AI education company. Mr. Ng recently spoke with WIPO Magazine about the transformative power of AI, and the measures required to ensure that AI benefits everyone.

“For AI to reach its full potential, governments should be thoughtful about protecting citizens, while also creating room for the positive innovation that AI can bring,” says Andrew Ng (photo: © NVIDIA Corporation).

Why is AI attracting so much attention?
AI is the new electricity. It will transform every industry and create huge economic value. Technology like supervised learning is automation on steroids. It is very good at automating tasks and will have an impact on every sector – from healthcare to manufacturing, logistics and retail.
When you talk about AI, what exactly do you mean?
Much of the economic value generated by AI today is driven by “supervised learning,” which is really good at figuring out simple input–output, or A to B responses, and mapping them. When you join up lots of input-output pairs, this is called deep learning. Deep learning is really good at image recognition, speech recognition and natural language processing. Today, the technology’s most lucrative application is probably determining whether consumers will click on an advertisement. Large online platforms are using this technology to create enormous economic value.
But supervised learning and other AI techniques can do much more. For example, we can input a satellite image of an area, and generate an output that tells us whether it is poverty-stricken and needs more resources. We can input data from a city, and generate an output that identifies areas with the greatest risk of gas leaks. Or we can build more accurate climate change models. There are huge untapped AI opportunities in sectors like agriculture, healthcare and manufacturing.

AI is the new electricity. It has the potential to transform every industry and to create huge economic value

Earlier this year, WIPO launched the first report in the WIPO Technology Trends Series on AI. Why is this important?
The WIPO Technology Trends Report offers a clearer understanding of growth trends in AI, and who is using this technology and in which parts of the world. For example, it shows that until now, only a small number of regions and organizations have focused on AI technology. The report also reveals that deep learning is the biggest and fastest growing technique in AI. While great progress has been made with deep learning in terms of collecting more data and creating more powerful computers to make it work, we still have a long way to go. Effective “unsupervised learning” – learning without labelled data – will be very important.

“Most of the inventions and most of the value to be created through AI have not yet been realized,” notes Andrew Ng. “My advice to government leaders of developing nations is to focus on their strengths. For example, if your country is a large coffee exporter, work on AI technologies to optimize how you farm, process and export coffee beans. You have huge opportunities in doing that for your local economy.” (Photo: Alamy Stock Photo / © Hero Images Inc.).

So are there any downsides to AI?
AI will have an impact on some jobs. To ensure that AI reaches its full potential, drives tremendous global economic growth, and that the fruits of AI are shared fairly, we need government, educators and businesses to work together.
What role can governments play in ensuring AI delivers on its promise?
Governments must invest heavily in education to give citizens a path to success in this AI-powered future. That doesn’t mean simply asking people to work harder, it means asking them to study harder. We need to give people an opportunity to learn the skills they need for an AI-powered society. Today, society needs more AI engineers, but it also needs more healthcare workers, caregivers and teachers. It also needs more wind turbine technicians. There are many important roles to fill and we need to help individuals step into those roles so they can participate in the exciting AI future that we are building. At a time when AI is disrupting many jobs and industries, governments have an important role to play in helping individuals succeed, contribute to and reap the rewards of this AI-powered economy.

If governments, universities and corporations work together to encourage education and innovation, then all nations and all people have an almost unlimited opportunity to be part of this new AI economy

Do governments need to regulate AI?
Thoughtful regulation will be important. For AI to reach its full potential, governments should be thoughtful about protecting citizens, while also creating room for the positive innovation that AI can bring. Take for example, the US start-up, Zipline that uses drones – computer controlled airplanes – to deliver blood. One of the main reasons why Zipline launched its drone service in Rwanda was because of the regulatory clarity that exists in Rwanda. What we are seeing over time is that governments with more thoughtful policies that allow AI-innovations into their economies will create value for their citizens more rapidly and thereby help grow their economies.

About WIPO Technology Trends 2019 – Artificial Intelligence
The WIPO Technology Trends report provides a common information base on AI for policy and decision makers in government, business and others, who are grappling with the ramifications of a new technology that promises to transform many areas of economic, social and cultural activity.
Among the report’s findings:

Since the emergence of AI in the 1950s up to the end of 2016, innovators and researchers filed applications for nearly 340,000 AI-related inventions and published over 1.6 million scientific publications.
AI-related patenting is growing rapidly, with more than half of the identified inventions published since 2013.
Companies represent 26 out of the top 30 AI patent applicants. Universities and public research organizations account for the remaining four.
International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), (USA), had the largest portfolio of AI patent applications at the end of 2016, followed by Microsoft Corp., (USA), Toshiba Corp., (Japan), the Samsung Group (Republic of Korea) and NEC Group (Japan).
Chinese Organizations account for three of the four academic players featuring in the top 30 patent applicants, with the Chinese Academy of Sciences ranked 17.
Machine learning is the dominant AI technique disclosed in patents, included in more than one-third of all identified inventions.
Deep learning, a machine-learning technique that includes speech recognition systems, is the fastest growing AI technique.
Computer vision, which includes image recognition, is the most popular AI application, mentioned in 49 percent of all AI-related patents.
The transportation sector, including autonomous vehicles, is among the fields with the fastest rates of AI-related growth.
Significant growth rates were also registered in telecommunications, life and medical sciences (esp. robotic surgery and drug personalization) and personal devices, computing and human-computer interaction.


What role can educators play?
We need to build a society of life-long learners where we constantly update our skills and knowledge. The availability of online digital learning tools and content, such as those offered by Coursera, can now let many more people gain knowledge much more inexpensively than was possible with traditional analogue-based models of instruction. At Coursera, 45 percent of learners come from developing economies. Many organizations are working hard to ensure they can deliver digital content to learners around the world.
In addition to pure online digital models of education, blended learning models show great promise. With blended learning, some content is delivered on line with classroom time reserved for students to participate in much richer discussions with professors or their peers. If you let a computer do what it does best – record and deliver multiple types of content – it is possible to free up instructors’ time to deliver education in a way that is much more inexpensive and scalable than traditional methods of instruction. I hope education institutions worldwide will embrace ideas like blended learning and the flipped classroom because the world needs us to deliver high-quality education to many more people.
And the corporate sector?
For many years, developing countries have been asked to climb a predictable ladder (e.g. starting with textiles, moving up to low-end manufacturing and then to high-end manufacturing and eventually manufacturing high-end electronics). One of the problems with AI is that we may be automating away the lower rungs of this ladder. But developing economies still need a way to climb the ladder so they can educate their citizens and enable them to move to higher value jobs and grow their economies. With corporations, governments and universities working together I hope we can replace the ladder with a trampoline and give people the education they need to take advantage of the opportunities that AI offers.
What advice do you have for policymakers in developing countries?
Don’t re-invent the wheel. For example, I would not recommend that a small country builds the next great search engine. We already have multiple great search engines. Most of the inventions and most of the value to be created through AI have not yet been realized. There is still a huge opportunity for everyone, including developing economies, to own a piece of the AI pie. My advice to government leaders of developing nations is to focus on their strengths. For example, if you have a strong mining industry, build AI solutions for mining, because your country will have huge advantages in finding AI solutions to mining compared to a Silicon Valley company. Or if your country is a large coffee exporter, work on AI technologies to optimize how you farm, process and export coffee beans. Again, you have huge advantages in doing that for your local economy. Markets are increasingly global and with AI and an Internet connection, I think it is possible for almost everyone to improve their core industries and provide better products to the world.
Is leadership important?
In moments of technological disruption, leadership matters. Here in the United States we once trusted our government to put a man on the moon. And we did it. The AI world is immature, even the leading cities for AI – Silicon Valley (USA) and Beijing (People’s Republic of China) – do not have mature AI ecosystems because the field is just too new. So if governments, universities and corporations work together to encourage education and innovation, all nations and all people have an opportunity to be part of this new AI economy.

One of the more recent terms rising to prominence is Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) – but what does it mean?








Artificial Intelligence Explained: What Are Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)?

The principle behind the GAN was first proposed in 2014, and at its most basic level, it describes a system that pits two AI systems (neural networks) against each other to improve the quality of their results.
To understand how they work, imagine a blind forger trying to create copies of paintings by great masters. To start with, he has no idea what a painting should look like – but he happens to have a friend who has a photographic memory of every masterpiece that's ever been painted.
PROMOTED
This friend – a detective – has to determine whether the paintings his friend is showing match the features of those created by the real great masters, or are obvious forgeries.
This is the basic idea of how a GAN operates – only as they are AIs, both the forger and his friend are able to act at super-speed, making and detecting thousands of forgeries per second. Both of them then ""learn"" from the outcome to improve their future performance. As the detective becomes better at detecting forgeries, the forger must become better at creating them.
GANs have been the cause of a lot of excitement within the field of AI development in recent years, due to their ability to create “new” information following rules established by existing information. An example might be writing instruction manuals. By training a GAN on thousands of instruction manuals, it could one day be possible to create a system that could look at any tool, device or software and then create instructions on how to use it.
So, let’s look into how this works in a bit more depth. The “forger” network that creates fake data is termed the generative network, and its job is to read and understand the properties of the training data. It then attempts to replicate it by producing “candidate” datasets that follow the same rules.

The “detective” network tasked with determining whether the generative network is outputting false (artificially generated) data or real (training) data is known as the discriminative network. Because it competes against the generative network, the system as a whole is described as ""adversarial.""
For a great working example of a GAN in action, look no further than the popular demonstration This Person Does Not Exist. The network powering the website has learned to produce ultra-realistic images of human faces that, while they follow all of the rules regarding the way a human face should look, do not exist outside of the computer program.
While you might at first assume that the program builds images of faces by putting together pieces from a database of eyes, ears, mouths, and hair, this isn't the case. The ""input"" data for the generative network is simply a string of numbers – only the discriminative network sees the training data. The generative network improves its output based entirely on the output of the discriminative network.
As the only feedback the discriminative network gives is yes/no “guesses” at whether the generative output matches the training data, it takes many, many attempts before it starts to produce output that is acceptably close to the desired outputs – in this case, a realistic-looking image of a non-existent person.
(This example actually uses an updated model of the GAN known as proGAN which was developed by Nvidia last year, and works by gradually increasing the resolution of the image that the network generates, starting with a very low-resolution 4 pixel by 4 pixel image.)
The data used for training an adversarial network does not have to be labeled, as the discriminative network can make judgments on the output of the generative network based entirely on features of the training data itself. This means GANs have applications in unsupervised learning as well as supervised (where the data is labeled) and reinforcement learning.
Another useful feature of GANs is that they can be used to efficiently create training datasets for other AI applications. Most current AI techniques, in particular, Deep Learning, rely on access to large amounts of data for training purposes.
GANs can generate datasets that follow all of the rules of ""natural"" datasets and so, in theory, can be used for training of deep learning models. A great example of where this would be useful might be medical images, that can be expensive and time-consuming to collect for real – requiring both patient consent and medical expertise to label them.
GANs can be used for creating images, moving video images, text, and even music. While it's clear that there is a lot of hype surrounding the concept at the moment, it is clearly one of the most interesting new concepts to appear from the AI field in recent years, and we can expect to see many exciting new applications based on it in the near future.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",,Enterprise & Cloud,True,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Forbes Homepage', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Innovation', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/innovation/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Enterprise Tech', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/enterprise-tech/'}]",,,,,,,,,

Artificial intelligence tool helps find brain aneurysms


			Stanford researchers have designed a new AI tool to help clinicians identify brain aneurysms. HeadXNet is designed to work with, not replace, radiologists.

A future where artificial intelligence is part of medical care may not look all that different. That's one lesson we can take away from a new AI tool, made by Stanford University researchers in computer science and medicine, which is designed to help clinicians identify brain aneurysms. 
The work appears in JAMA Network Open.
Built around an algorithm called HeadXNet, the tool looks through head scans -- made using computed tomography angiography -- and for every voxel, the 3D version of a pixel, decides whether or not there is a sign of an aneurysm. 
At the end of this process, a semi-transparent red overlay shows up on the scans everywhere that HeadXNet predicts there is an aneurysm. This visualization is purposefully subtle; a way to encourage clinicians who use HeadXNet to give those areas a closer look.
""Search for an aneurysm is one of the most labor-intensive and critical tasks radiologists undertake,"" said Kristen Yeom, MD, associate professor of radiology and co-senior author of the paper, in a Stanford press release. ""Given inherent challenges of complex neurovascular anatomy and potential fatal outcome of a missed aneurysm, it prompted me to apply advances in computer science and vision to neuroimaging.""
In order to see their tool in a realistic work flow, the researchers put a lot of time and effort into integrating it within scan viewers, which radiologists currently use. Eight clinicians tested it by evaluating a set of 115 brain scans for aneurysm, once with the help of HeadXNet and once without. The tool improved clinicians' ability to correctly identify aneurysms at a level equivalent to finding six more aneurysms in 100 scans that contain aneurysms. It also improved agreement between the clinicians.
There are many directions the researchers could take their work from here. Yeom has suggested the possibility of altering the algorithm to identify aneurysms that have burst, a dangerous condition. The researchers are also planning to establish a multi-center collaboration to make AI health care technologies, like HeadXNet, easier to use across different hospitals, which tend to have different hardware, patient populations and imaging protocols.
Given the challenges of making AI work in all these different situations -- and the vital importance of accurate diagnoses -- these researchers think that collaboration between AI health care technologies and clinicians is a particularly promising path forward.
""There's been a lot of concern about how machine learning will actually work within the medical field,"" said Allison Park, a Stanford graduate student in statistics and co-lead author of the paper. ""This research is an example of how humans stay involved in the diagnostic process, aided by an artificial intelligence tool.""

More and more organizations are beginning to use or expand their use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools and services in the workplace. Despite AI’s proven potential for enhancing efficiency and decision-making, it has raised a host of issues in the workplace which, in turn, have prompted an array of federal and state regulatory efforts that are likely to increase in the near future.
Artificial intelligence, defined very simply, involves machines performing tasks in a way that is intelligent. The AI field involves a number of subfields or forms of AI that solve complex problems associated with human intelligence—for example, machine learning (computers using data to make predictions), natural-language processing (computers processing and understanding a natural human language like English), and computer vision or image recognition (computers processing, identifying, and categorizing images based on their content).
One area where AI is becoming increasingly prevalent is in talent acquisition and recruiting. Many organizations have adopted machine learning-based software to auto-screen or facilitate the screening of job candidates. Additionally, AI tools are powering many of the increasingly common employee self-service tools that allow for quicker, more efficient answers to common employee relations questions.
The benefits of AI include improved efficiency, lower costs of products and services, improved quality, and fewer errors. But AI is not perfect. Indeed, government and media attention has centered on the potential for AI-driven tools to be biased or discriminatory. For example, during the Obama administration, the Executive Office of the President of the United States issued a detailed report on algorithmic systems, AI opportunity, and potential civil rights issues that highlighted the potential for positive impact from AI while underscoring issues about “the potential of encoding discrimination in automated decisions.” Similarly, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has also been concerned about these issues and has emphasized assessing how employment discrimination protections apply and can be used in the context of AI-powered systems.
Initial City, State, and Federal AI Regulations Rolled Out
Despite this media and governmental attention, the pace of legislation has over the last decade been slow. There are signs, however, that this may be changing. A number of city, state, and federal regulations have been proposed or enacted with a goal of eliminating potential discrimination and increasing transparency related to AI. For example:
Facial Recognition Software Ban. Technology-friendly San Francisco passed a ban in mid-May 2019 on the use of facial recognition software by police and other government agencies. The ban, which does not apply to the use of facial recognition software by private entities, makes San Francisco the first major city to legislatively ban the use of this technology. Similar bans are under consideration in other jurisdictions (such as the Commonwealth of Massachusetts).
AI in Hiring in Illinois. One popular use of AI in the hiring process is through AI “interview bots,” which evaluate personal characteristics such as an applicant’s facial expression, body language, word choice, and tone of voice. The software then provides employers with feedback that can be used to evaluate whether to hire a candidate. On May 29, 2019, the Illinois General Assembly passed a first-of-its-kind measure that would impose restrictions on employers’ use of this kind of artificial intelligence in hiring. It is expected to be signed shortly by Illinois’s governor as the bill passed without a single “no” vote. The law, known as the Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act, is a disclosure and informed consent rule that would require employers to take the following steps before asking applicants to submit to video interviews:

notify applicants for Illinois-based positions of plans to have their video interviews analyzed electronically;
explain to the applicants how the artificial intelligence analysis technology works and what characteristics will be used to evaluate them; and
obtain the applicants’ consent to the use of the technology.

Notably, Illinois has become something of an incubator for workplace technology legislation. It was the first state to pass legislation regulating employers’ use of employee biometric information (e.g., retinal scans, facial recognition software, and fingerprint information).
Federal Algorithmic Accountability Act. On April 10, 2019, congressional Democrats introduced the Algorithmic Accountability Act of 2019, which seeks to enhance federal oversight of artificial intelligence and data privacy. (In some respects, the proposed law is similar to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation.) If passed, the Algorithmic Accountability Act would regulate AI systems as well as any “automated decision system” that makes a decision or facilitates human decision-making that impacts consumers. For processes that fit the proposed statute’s definition, organizations would be required to audit for bias and discrimination and take appropriate corrective action to resolve any identified issues. The bill would give oversight responsibility to the Federal Trade Commission.
The Algorithmic Accountability Act has limited likelihood of successfully passing Congress. However, it could be a harbinger of things to come. This kind of legislation may gain momentum on a federal level depending on how the 2020 elections play out. And, regardless, proposed federal legislation often catches the attention of legislators in one or more states and spurs similar proposals at the state level. Indeed, California, for example, has passed the California Consumer Privacy Act, a sweeping data privacy law that becomes effective January 1, 2020, and whose scope and application to workplaces remains unclear.

For nearly four thousand years, the horse was as integral to warfighting as weapons and armor. Then the Second Industrial Revolution led to developments in motorized vehicles and aircraft. These new technologies’ experimental use during World War I hinted at a new style of war. What those hints portended was the subject of intense debate in the years that followed. Some recognized that motorized vehicles would dramatically change the way wars were fought. But many others held on to the deep-seated, millennia-old preference for beasts of burden on the battlefield. Only World War II would eliminate any remaining such preference. And with the horses’ disappearance from their old roles, the military services also divested all associated equine training, breeding, and care in exchange for drivers, welders, and mechanics.
We are again in a period of disruptive technological progress—the Fourth Industrial Revolution—and this current era of persistent low-intensity conflict is arguably an interwar period not unlike that of the 1920s and 1930s. Experts are again intensely debating how new technology—in the form of automation, robotics, and artificial intelligence—will change the character of war. Killer robots, loss of control, and abdication of human responsibility in killing another human are all profound issues for us to confront. However, while national security experts often focus on the sexy applications of these technologies (and public attention is most easily earned by apocalyptic characterizations), too little attention is paid to the more obvious and less complicated issue: those same technologies are also reshaping the workforce. In historical terms, this is akin to debating the merits of using vehicles as mobile firing positions on the battlefield while overlooking the way motorized transport would, for example, dramatically transform logistics.
Even if militaries shun killer robots, nonlethal automated and autonomous systems will still play significant roles in warfare—and will do so very soon. In 1980, then Commandant of the Marine Corps Gen. Robert H. Barrow said, “Amateurs talk about tactics, but professionals study logistics.” And people are the resource with the longest lead time. These new technologies will have equally profound impacts on the military labor force as on direct combat and we need to adapt to this new reality. Automation will require reducing certain specialties, re-skilling many service members, and creating entirely new job families. Moreover, the trends will have second-order impacts on who we recruit and how we train while increasing dependencies on data and communications.
Automation is already displacing workers in the global workforce and the body of literature expects this to get more intense over the next ten years. Creating autonomous weapons is both far more difficult and much more contentious than either automating low-skilled jobs or creating narrow artificial intelligence for specific, complex tasks. Unsurprisingly, trends within the civilian workforce show that the tasks that are easiest to automate are highly repetitive, are often manual, and require a low degree of judgment. Conversely, the skills that are most difficult to automate involve applying expertise, interacting with human stakeholders in complex situations, and creativity. One important caveat is that low-skilled jobs performed in unpredictable environments—gardening, plumbing, childcare—will generally see less automation, but many of these roles have low wages already. This is important as it reflects the second-order fear that automation will hollow out the middle class and lead to less socioeconomic mobility, which has implications for the military.
As automation displaces humans in some areas, workers will need to shift into new fields where difficult-to-automate human skills are of critical importance. Experts predict a growing need for particular categories of workers: caregivers, coaches, subject-matter experts, technicians (e.g., software, data, cloud), and educators. Viewed broadly, these industries fall into two categories: improving human performance and improving technological performance and integration. The increased specialization between humans and computers will lead to efficiency gains—the so-called Third Offset—but other impacts such as the need to re-skill workers are less obvious and receive less consideration in the national security community.
It is perhaps predictable that military leaders are focusing on killer robots and missing the big picture. The last eighteen years of war, conducted on a rotational model that constantly cycles units in and out of combat zones, seem to have only reinforced an emphasis on a near horizon line and undercut interest in the specific types of critical thinking, imagination, or modernization needed to conceptualize, as an organization, the full range of new technologies’ applications. Moreover, there are dynamics related to the nature of bureaucracies at play. Digital automation requires digital information and the military has struggled to adapt modern best practices that would enable much of this transformation—from software systems that do not connect with each other to the use of paper or other manual processes. It is no surprise that there are significant barriers to overcome before an institution that struggles to have a user-friendly system for processing official travel can field a lethal autonomous robot.
Regardless of why scholars and senior leaders have so far missed the low-hanging fruit, it is time to begin addressing it. Recruiting and training people for the military occupations of the future will take years and the services can begin reaping the benefits of automation if they start investing now.
Embracing Automation, Re-Skilling Soldiers, and Creating the Jobs of the Future
Again, across the economy, automation and AI will have the soonest impact on roles that fall into three categories: those that are predictable and primarily physical; those related to data collection; and those that involve data processing. Many of the specific fields—food preparation and serving, transportation, construction, and office and administrative support roles, for instance—have direct counterparts in the military. The services should immediately begin phasing out or automating as much of these roles as possible. It’s not sexy, but long before we can create autonomous Terminator-like warbots, we will need autonomous systems that can perform nonlethal manual tasks and use natural language processing to manage personnel paperwork. Increasing automation in these roles will both change how the human workers perform their duties and liberate soldiers who can be re-skilled into new areas.
So where would soldiers displaced by automation be used? In jobs that will see an increased demand. The Army is currently undertaking an effort to improve lethality, especially in its close-combat forces. But it should avoid the temptation to treat this as a technological or hardware challenge, when it is fundamentally about people. Improving the way the Army conducts physical fitness training and the way it measures fitness—inarguably central to soldier effectiveness (and lethality)—is a case in point. Much of the debate around the Army’s new physical fitness test focuses on the cost of the equipment and the difficulty of the events. Improving lethality requires shifting soldiers out of roles that are better suited for machines and into health, conditioning, human performance, and counselor or therapist roles.
Special operations units have dedicated athletic trainers and physical therapists, but we will need both far more to support direct combat units and a wider array of specialists including coaches, counselors, and educators. The services, to varying degrees, already have versions of these roles and they need to re-invest the savings from automation into them to gain further performance improvements.
Lastly, the services need to accept that these trends are not going away and should embrace the new technology rather than keep it at arm’s length—and begin thinking about the workforce they need to succeed in the future operating environment. They shouldn’t worry about purple-haired techies; they should start creating software soldiers and other tech warriors. Here are two steps that they can take now.

Tactical unmanned vehicle operators: Before we deploy lethal autonomous swarm drones, the services will need to embrace drones. The Army has added small unmanned aerial vehicles to the equipment for many units, but lags in updating the tactical doctrine for their use. To date, only the Marine Corps has announced plans to place drone operator specialists in every infantry rifle squad. It is unclear if this will simply be an infantryman with additional training (and possibly a skill code) or an entirely new military occupational specialty and there are precedents for both cases. Looking further to the future, the careers developed for these specialists can also help to shape careers and training of swarm drone operators and other unique roles for autonomous ground and undersea vehicles.
More technical experts: The Air Force launched a pilot program in 2017 to create a software development team within the service. Named Kessel Run, the program has been a runaway success and more than validated the concept. The other services should immediately begin similar pilots, but expand them to also include other skills in data science and cloud computing architecture. The combination of skills will create teams that can rapidly build, test, and deploy scalable IT systems that will empower warfighters and accelerate other innovation projects. Having these technologists within the force may lead to applications that are even more imaginative than what is currently conceived. The services can also reap the lessons learned from talent management within the cyber force to avoid early attrition and further improve talent management for technical experts.

Broader Impacts of Automation
While ethicists and policymakers are debating the impact of autonomy on warfighting, it appears as though relatively little thought has been given to the impact of automation on warfighters. What happens when automation leads to greater specialization between humans and computers?
Experts expect automation to displace more men than women in the civilian workforce as men disproportionately fill roles most ready for automation. By contrast, women disproportionately fill roles in the civilian workforce that are difficult to automate and will see increased demand—jobs that demand critical thinking and emotional intelligence. Similarly in the military, technological shifts could create greater opportunities for women to leverage the skills that are most valuable in the types of jobs that will increase in demand.
Additionally, and while it’s likely wishful thinking, the confluence of greater demands for technical skills and increased emphasis on human performance may someday shift basic training from its historical function of weeding out weak recruits to instead focus on developing their unique talents (which will improve satisfaction and retention and drive down recruiting churn—a virtuous cycle).
Depending on how the services classify these new technical and human performance specialties, automation may widen the rift between enlisted and officer ranks and may decrease the role of military service as a mechanism for social mobility. Some experts argue that automation is leaving fewer middle-skill roles in the civilian workforce, and it is critical that the military works to avoid this fate. Failure to do so will raise important concerns of about “who serves” and have a consequent impact on civil-military relations.
Lastly, military recruitment may get a bump thanks to increased AI, but that’s not necessarily a good thing. The military is struggling both to recruit tech talent and to meet its recruitment goals for a workforce that has not yet been disrupted by automation. While AI will make recruiters more effective, automation will also displace civilian workers in historically strong recruiting areas—the heartland and rural areas. The services will have incentives to accept these recruits rather than make the changes to recruiting that are needed to attract the workforce of tomorrow. Service leaders will need to clearly define (and closely measure) the attributes sought in recruits when balancing efforts to find and attract the best talent with adapting the workforce for tomorrow.
Start Now
When it comes to preparing for AI-empowered warfare, senior defense leaders and intellectuals seem to be missing the forest for the trees. Current paradigms of future war tend to either reflect incremental innovation (artillery that shoots farther) or the sort of science fiction that is always thirty to forty years away. The middle ground is a defense enterprise that sees the changing nature of warfare rooted in information technology hardware and software, and it is long past time to start doing the hard work of truly modernizing the services. To prepare for this future of war, all of the services will need to transform their workforces in ways that, put simply, they are not even discussing.

Augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and smart glasses: ‘VIEW’ technology for the 2019 holiday season 

By Seth Patin, founder and CEO, LogistiVIEW
Warehouse workers can be faster, safer, and more accurate this holiday season. 
LogistiVIEW’s “Visual Input Enabled Wearable” (VIEW) technology improves workforce productivity and job satisfaction by making processes hands free and eyes focused.
Intuitive voice and visual instructions make work easy and training rapid. These benefits can all be accomplished in time for the 2019 holiday season thanks to LogistiVIEW’s Connected Worker Platform. 
Built on VIEW technology, it combines Computer Vision, Augmented Reality (AR), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and smart glasses so a warehouse management system (WMS) can see and use what it sees to collect data and instruct the workforce.
VIEW devices – smart glasses in supply chain
WMS solutions are good at managing information, but not truly intuitive for the floor worker. This is primarily because lines of text are not the best way to tell someone how to do work; humans respond best to visual instructions.
For that reason, most companies discuss on-boarding and training in terms of days, or worse yet, weeks.
VIEW technology rethinks workforce instruction by creating a system that increases productivity and job satisfaction. It starts with rethinking workforce mobile technology with the VIEW device.
A VIEW device is a small-scale head-mounted computer with a high definition camera, field of sight display, audio input and output, positional awareness sensors, and wireless networking.
When properly integrated with a WMS, VIEW devices revolutionize warehouse operations by bringing a completely hands-free and AR directed worker experience. Today these types of devices are commonly called smart glasses.

Operational impact of VIEW devices
VIEW technology works with a WMS to help it “know” what tasks a worker is supposed to perform as well as where a worker is located, what product the worker is holding, what product the worker is near, what physical obstacles surround the worker, and what other workers are in the vicinity.
Leveraging AR, VIEW technology directs workers via voice instructions and visual cues by overlaying information into the worker’s field of vision. The system knows where a worker needs to go and directs the worker via overlaid arrows and highlighting.
Once at the destination, workers execute workflows in the WMS by simply looking at the product as directed by the VIEW device or scanning the barcodes with a wearable Bluetooth scanner.
Inexperienced warehouse workers hired for the 2019 holiday season are able to pick a high-value serialized item by simply looking at the storage location barcode and scanning the product to be picked.
The system isolates all the scanned barcodes, catalogs meaning via AI filtering, and processes a pick transaction with the correct part number, serial number, and storage location without the user taking hands or eyes off the product.
Hands-free workflow improves efficiency while eyes-focused workflow and AI-validated data capture, reduce the likelihood of critical errors.
Optimizing workflows and providing superior track and trace capabilities supports Lean Manufacturing, Six Sigma initiatives, and industry best-practices.
VIEW devices bring a new level of workforce accountability, which is of paramount importance for 2019 holiday picking, packing, and shipping. Operations management has an unprecedented level of information about workers’ activities.
Warehouse shift managers assist new, low-skilled labor by shadowing a worker remotely in real-time and reviewing the workers’ movements through the facility during the work shift.
Efficiency gains are quantifiable
When a worker is confused about inventory at a location, rather than a supervisor walking across the entire warehouse, the supervisor simply shadows the user and talks to them through the questions using VIEW devices.
Warehouse managers can walk the floor and simply look at a QR code on the side of a row of pick bins to get a real-time report of productivity in that pick face for the shift.
Workforce management solutions are supercharged by the information obtained with VIEW devices driving quantifiable efficiency gains.
Just in time for the 2019 holiday season
Rapidly implemented in as little as 60 days, these technologies can still generate optimal holiday profitability this year.
From 3PLs to warehouses and distribution centers, the urgent need for this workforce technology is undeniable.
The ability to simplify complex processes in a way that improves both productivity and job satisfaction means low-skilled warehouse labor can be faster, safer, and more accurate in fulfilling orders this holiday season.

On the Naukri portal, they have over 60 million resumes, half a million recruiters and any given day, over 13-14 lakh applicants for jobs.In 1997, before Google came into being, an Indian internet company called Info Edge launched Naukri.com, which remained a hugely popular jobs portal for over a decade. However, the time has come now to upgrade itself for the next internet era and to take on the likes of LinkedIn, which have become successful in their own right.In an interview with Business Insider, Info Edge CEO Hitesh Oberoi spoke about how Naukri.com will evolve from being just a jobs portal to a careers platform and how they are working on the current big trend with Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Big Data. Building on the new trendToday, it’s the new trend that’s taking over the world by storm – technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Big Data. And this one Naukri doesn’t want to pass out on. “The truth is every time you figure out these trends, they take your business to the new level. We are trying to invest substantially into these areas,” said Oberoi.Naukri’s clients – the recruiters have long had the problem of spam. For one job listing, there are thousands of applicants. And here’s where AI, ML and data science will take over. “We are sitting on tons of data. So much can be done, from matching applicants to jobs, user experience, giving them advice/suggestions, identifying hot skills – everything can be determined with AI and ML. We can transform Naukri from being a jobs portal to a careers platform,” said Oberoi.The Naukri portal has over 60 million resumes, half a million recruiters. On any given day, they have over 1.3-1.4 million jobs applicants use the site, according to the company. #ThrowbackThe company that went public within 9 years of its formation, has survived all the big waves the internet industry has seen – Search, social networking and mobile. The internet as we know today has exploded over the past 20 years and has given birth to several different giant entities like the social media. But Info Edge came about when nobody understood what the internet was but the founders knew – jobs were the key. Over the years, Oberoi says there have been multiple waves that have hit the industry and each one brings with it a challenge as well as an opportunity.Discovering Search “When we there was no Google. In 2002, we launched a database product (which today is over 65% of our revenue) but didn’t exist when we got funded. We were trailing our competitors with respect to the number of CVs on our platform. Advertising in the newspaper wasn’t working for us,” said Oberoi. It was then that Google became big and suddenly a lot of traffic was out there. “We started search engine marketing in 2003. We were advertising on millions of keywords on Google, there was nobody else back then and it was a bidding model. We put all our resources on Google,” he said. And within two months, they were getting an extra 400 CVs a day. “That’s how we capitalized on the search wave,” he said. The networking eraThe next wave that hit them was the social media wave. LinkedIn, which was founded in 2002, jumped on the networking train and became a social media giant of its own. However, Naukri failed to work around it. “We were unable to figure out how to use it to our benefit. LinkedIn got there first. What you need to understand is that the trick lies in figuring it out before the others do,” said Oberoi. Going mobileOberoi lists the next wave of internet revolution to be the mobile generation and this one he said they figured out fast and right. “We realised what works on the desktop doesn’t work on the mobile. Today, 80% of Naukri traffic comes from mobile and when it comes to Jeevan Saathi, it’s 90%,” he said.Other investmentsInfo Edge also has other successful portals JeevanSathi.com (a matrimonials site), a real estate listings platform called 99acres.com, and education platform Shiksha.com. Over the years, they have been investing money into companies that can add on to their in-house businesses. Naukri had acquired consultancy firm Toostep in 2012, hiring startup Ambition Box two years ago, and in May 2019, it acquired rival iimjobs.com. And they have a plan through all of it. They want to use data to give insights to job seekers on how they can improve their prospects, to produce new products – an insight platforms for recruiters, to going beyond sourcing and building a holistic platform which includes shortlisting of candidates, scheduling interviews and more. They already have a product – Naukri Recruitment Management System.“Increasingly, all our investments are in the AI, ML space,” said Oberoi.See Also:Automation will affect women the most in the Indian job market: Report",,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': '600', 'height': '60', 'url': 'https://staticbiassets.in/thumb/msid-60085318,width-1000,height-750/default-thumb.jpg'}","['https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderIndia', 'https://twitter.com/BiIndia']"

While India ranks sixth in terms of employee remuneration.Highest paying countriesAverage Salary offered(USD) per annum in 2018USA1,18,836 ( ₹8.25 million)UK80,244Canada 96,785China40,038Philippines23,500India17,641 ( ₹1.23 million)According to the data accumulated over the last seven years, US working professionals have been offered the highest and consistently growing salaries in the IT sector. Overall, the country has an average take home salary as $60,717( nearly ₹4.2 million), as per the data by Management Development Institute (MDI) World Talent Ranking.Following the trend, China and Canada have also shown a positive growth in salaries, owing to the new technologies fueling the job market. However, Indian working professionals witnessed a significant dip in salaries in the last seven years — from $20,372( ₹1.41 million) in 2012 to $17,641 (₹1.23 million) in 2018. The noted drop in salaries may be due to the reduction in manpower as automation took over majority of tasks. ]]> The trend shows the gap among the leading countries for the IT job roles, compared to India. However, the IT sector seems to be bracing up for extensive hirings in India. The emerging digitalisation will eventually lead to a rise in demand for workforce skilled in automation tools including artificial intelligence and machine learning.According to World Economic Forum, the IT sector is expected to create nearly 133 million new job opportunities by 2022.See also:Hiring by Indian IT companies has grown 12 months in a row, up over three-foldH-1B visas: US immigration seems to like certain companies more than othersRise in US H-1B visa rejection may force Indian tech companies to look at M&amp;A",,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'width': '600', 'height': '60', 'url': 'https://staticbiassets.in/thumb/msid-60085318,width-1000,height-750/default-thumb.jpg'}","['https://www.facebook.com/BusinessInsiderIndia', 'https://twitter.com/BiIndia']"
