Following on from work carried out in spring 2017 in the context of the #FranceIA initiative, to which France Stratégie contributed, Member of Parliament Cédric Villani was assigned the task of analysing the economic, social, environmental and ethical issues involved in artificial intelligence. Muriel Pénicaud, Minister of Labour, and Mounir Mahjoubi, Minister of State for the Digital Sector, commissioned France Stratégie to make a special study of the impacts of artificial intelligence on the world of work, which is the subject of this Report. 
Download the report ""Artificial Intelligence and Work""
 
Artificial intelligence – meaning the group of technologies that aim to carry out tasks traditionally assigned to human beings computationally – is central to current debate on social transformations. First and foremost, expected changes in the world of work give rise to two contrasting attitudes. Some people proclaim their optimism in the face of a technology that ensures productivity gains and is therefore a source of wealth, and which promises to do away with the most tedious tasks. Others make pessimistic prophecies on the inevitable disappearance of whole realms of activity and corresponding jobs. This being so, public debate is polarised in unproductive opposition as it fails to highlight factors of transformation or levers for action.
In order to help clarify such debate, Muriel Pénicaud, Minister of Labour, and Mounir Mahjoubi, Minister of State for the Digital Sector, entrusted France Stratégie with the mission of analysing the impacts of artificial intelligence (AI) on the world of work1. This mission is complementary to the one that the Prime Minister entrusted to Member of Parliament Cédric Villani, which, given its wider scope, tackles questions of research, industrial policies and ethics. The goal is the same: educate to eradicate fantasy, but take stock of expected transformations while identifying appropriate public policies2.
AI has been making spectacular progress over the last few years. Technologies resulting from recent research, such as machine learning and deep learning, have arrived from laboratories to carry out tasks that previously seemed impossible for machines to perform, such as image recognition, providing a satisfactory translation of a simple text, or winning a game of Go. Such technologies are already at work in our smartphones and constitute the framework of much of the pairing software already deployed in such areas as online advertising and profiling.
With the exception of a few specialised fields, AI is not yet much in evidence in most professions. This does not make its possibilities any the less significant, in particular for retail banking, transport and health – three sectors which are examined here in depth.
Artificial intelligence will undoubtedly be called upon to carry out complicated but repetitive or regularly performed tasks, which will obviously affect professions that include such tasks. But this transformation is not radically different from digitisation of the economy, which has been with us for some time and to which the banking, transport and health sectors have adapted more or less happily by modifying job content, training workers and developing new activities. Employees have also been adding to their skills for some time now in response to robotisation, in particular in industrial sectors, a fact that may guarantee their continued employment if it ensures growth of a company’s or sector’s activity. This is evidenced by the advanced robotisation of Germany’s automotive industry: in 2016, although it is one of the most robotised industries anywhere in the world, it had over 800,000 employees, 100,000 more than twenty years ago, as against 440,000 in France1.
There can be no doubt that employees risk losing their autonomy by being subjected to increasingly insidious automated monitoring, with all the psychosocial risks involved. We are well aware of the controversy over working conditions in a number of warehousing facilities, where automated monitoring of employees is carried out by a system incorporating voice synthesis. Such systems may lead to greater fragmentation of tasks, performed with support from software tools.
None of these challenges is completely new, and improvement of working conditions is just as likely a hypothesis as alienation and work intensification. Everything depends on the way in which productivity gains enabled by artificial intelligence are shared and the choices made in task and team organisation.
Of course, factors other than technology have an impact on work. The behaviour of workers, customers and suppliers, qualification levels of a sector’s workers and possible tensions connected with lack of manpower, along with regulatory obligations, often play a determining role in the evolution of work.
What makes the present context different is that artificial intelligence is often based on a learning mechanism, with ongoing accumulation of data enabling continuous improvement of systems – to the point of creating, one day in five or ten years’ time or more, a real breakthrough in what it is technologically possible to do, depending on tasks concerned. Emblematic of such a future breakthrough is the promised advent of the autonomous vehicle. This revolution in mobility may eventually do away with the profession of driver, but at the same time it opens up a whole range of possible new professions in complementary activities. Construction, maintenance, fleet management and passenger assistance will remain, while recreational outings, logistics and straightforward professional travel will all benefit from lower costs and/or increased availability.
Spectacular progress is to be expected in all three fields examined in this Report: autonomous vehicles providing mobility, automated financial advisors in the form of chatbots, and medical assistants participating in monitoring health and wellbeing on a daily basis, as well as in prediagnosis and therapeutic proposals.
How many people are concerned in their everyday working lives? Potentially everybody, all the more so in that artificial intelligence tools are generic in nature, typically concerned with natural language processing and voice or image recognition. The 800,000 people in France who work as drivers are likely to see their work change radically as use of autonomous vehicles increases. The transformation will not necessarily be a sudden one, but will lead to orientation of work content to supervisory and reception tasks, or tasks that machines are unable to manage (such as finding the doorbell, for a delivery man).
All this may still seem a long way off, but it is already mobilising actors (innovators, longstanding professionals, customers and users alike), which also affects work transformation dynamics.
We must prepare ourselves for artificial intelligence, not because its advent is inevitable but because, in the society in which we live, technological possibilities open up new prospects for individuals, organisations and structures. There is nothing at all to be gained by lasting opposition to solutions that improve our fellow citizens’ health, provide access to safer and less expensive mobility, and provide cheaper financial services better adapted to consumers’ needs.
There is more than one way to go in such evolution, however, and this is where the public authorities must concentrate their efforts: setting a path that matches citizens’ social expectations, by defining appropriate controls on critical subjects (responsibility, security, etc.), and by accompanying evolutions that occur too quickly, so that the social and economic fabric adjusts naturally.
On the basis of the analysis it presents, the Report identifies three focuses to respond to the issues involved in artificial intelligence as far as the world of work is concerned:

carrying out forward-planning work at industry and sector level on the potential of artificial intelligence, in order to ensure that stakeholders are fully informed and able to anticipate changes to come;
seeing that workers receive training on the issues of tomorrow’s world: training highly qualified workers for production of AI, and workers who are fully aware of the technological, legal, economic and ethical issues involved in the use of tools based on artificial intelligence;
improving schemes for safeguarding career paths in the sectors and subsectors that are set to be heavily impacted by the risk of automation.

Lastly, we should take care not to underestimate risks with regard to working conditions – loss of autonomy, work intensification, etc. – connected with the conditions in which AI tools are deployed in organisation of work.

In the coming years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is likely to be strategic for a myriad of industries. But there is a major challenge: recruiting. Simply put, it can be extremely tough to identify the right people who can leverage the technology (even worse, there is a fierce war for AI talent in Silicon Valley).

To be successful, it’s essential for companies to understand what are the key skillsets required (and yes, they are evolving). So let’s take a look:
Dan O’Connell, Chief Strategy Officer & Board Member, Dialpad:
I think it's critical for ""AI"" teams (natural language processing, machine learning, etc.) to have a mix of backgrounds -- hiring Ph.D's and academics who are thinking about and building the latest innovations, but combining that with individuals who have worked in a business environment and know how to code, ship product and are used to the cadence of a start-up or technology company. You can't go all academic, and you can't go all first-hand experience. We found the mix to be important in both building models, designing features, and bringing things to market.
PROMOTED
Sofus Macskassy, VP of Data Science, HackerRank:
Many don’t realize that you do not need a large team of deep learning experts to integrate AI in your business. A few experts, with a supporting staff of research engineers, product engineers and product managers can get the job done. There is much more to AI than deep learning, and businesses need to find a candidate with strong machine learning fundamentals. Many candidates with a theoretical background in machine learning have the tools they need to learn the job. Training AI talent on the specific needs for your business is cheaper and faster than training someone to be an AI expert. Hire strong research engineers that can take academic papers and equations and turn them into fast code. These are often engineers with a technical foundation in computer science, physics or electrical engineering. Together with your AI expert(s), they will make a powerful AI team. Add a product manager to tell them what product to build and you have a powerhouse.

Chris Hausler, Data Science Manager at Zendesk:
Any person working in the field of AI needs to be able to code and have solid mathematical and statistical skills. It's a misnomer that you need a PhD to work in AI, but genuine curiosity and an eagerness to learn will help you keep up with this fast moving field. Having the skills to implement and validate your own experimental ideas is a huge advantage.
We have found success hiring people from disciplines that focus on experimentation and problem solving. The Data Science team at Zendesk has a diverse background with people coming from Genetics, Economics, Pharmacy, Neuroscience, Computer Science and Machine Learning to name a few.

Atif Kureishy, Global VP, Emerging Practices at Teradata:
One could argue that the skills for AI are similar to data science; math, computer science and domain expertise, but the truth is that AI models are predicated on two things, automation and data – and lots of it.
Increasing sophistication in automating key aspects of building, training and deploying AI models (such as model selection, feature representation, hyper parameter tuning, etc.) mean the skillset needed must be focused on model lifecycle and model risk management principles to ensure model trust, transparency, safety and stability. Typically, these are spread across roles in organizations that touch on policy, regulation, ethics, technology and data science. But these will need to converge to build AI at scale.
Guy Caspi, CEO and co-founder at Deep Instinct:
People who have strong academic backgrounds sometimes lean towards one of two directions: either they cannot leave a project until it’s perfect, often missing important deadlines – or the opposite: they’re satisfied with basic academic-level standards that may not meet an organization’s production requirements. We search out people who have both a strong academic background, but also have a strong product/operational inclination.

In 1951, the Russian chemist Boris Belousov sent to a scientific journal a study in which he described an astonishing discovery: while trying to simulate a metabolic process in the laboratory, he had discovered a chemical reaction that occurred and then reversed itself on its own, alternating between a yellow colour and a colourless state. Belousov couldn’t find any journal willing to publish his results, since they appeared to violate a fundamental law of nature.
However, his work—which only came to light in 1959 through a brief presentation at a symposium—has become, half a century later, the foundation stone of a new discipline: chemical computing. This technological path is an alternative to quantum computing and conventional computing, capable of processing in parallel based on the same operating principles as our brain, promising futuristic applications, such as integrating in our body in the form of intelligent biosensors.
Computing is based on the use of logic gates, which process a data input—usually in binary code—to produce a result or output. In the chips of our current computers, this function is carried out thanks to semiconductors, materials with a binary response capacity operating through the movement of electrons. However, this is not the only possible system; quantum computing, currently in the experimental phase, uses properties of subatomic particles that can also take alternative values, with greater versatility than semiconductors.

Until the discovery of Belousov, no one would have suspected that chemical reactions could act as logic gates. According to the second law of thermodynamics, these processes are linear, spontaneously moving towards equilibrium through an increase in entropy, a measure of the energy of chaos; what is done cannot be undone, at least on its own. For this reason, Belousov’s work was rejected and ignored, until a decade later it was recovered, extended and made known by the biophysicist Anatol Zhabotinsky.
The first chemical oscillator
The Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction was the first chemical oscillator, a non-linear reaction that moves alternately in one direction and then the opposite as the process itself modifies the concentrations of the ions present, and which only stops when the reagents are consumed. In a Petri dish, these reactions produce waves of colours that diffuse from different points and act as inputs; the interaction between these input data can produce as an output a new wave—a 1, in binary code.
But this ability of chemical systems to compute by acting as logic gates is not something invented by humans, but was discovered, since it exists in nature. “We are already using chemical computers, because our brains and bodies employ communication via the diffusion of mediators, neuromodulators, hormones, etc.,” says computer scientist Andrew Adamatzky, director of the International Center of Unconventional Computing at the University of the West of England in Bristol. “We are chemical computers,” he summarises.

For decades it was believed that the brain’s computational capacity lay in the neuron as a minimal unit, and that its subcellular parts were limited to acting as simple transmitters of the decisions made by the cell in terms of the inputs received. Today it is known that this is not the case, and that discrete parts of the neuron, such as the dendrites (the branches that receive the signals), the axon (which sends the impulse to other neurons), and the synapse (the space that communicates between them) are independently modulable, and therefore capable of computing by themselves. As this modulation is exerted through chemical agents, the brain is not an electrical computer, but an electrochemical one.
The brain, a parallel computer
The great versatility of each neuron confers on the brain a valuable quality. “The brain and chemical computers are parallel computers,” explains biophysicist Vladimir Vanag, from the Centre for Nonlinear Chemistry at the Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University (Russia). Parallel computing is not within the reach of conventional microprocessors (though it is for quantum ones). In practice, this advantage that chemical computing possesses overcomes one of its drawbacks—its slower speed.
Compared with the great speed of electronic chips, chemical computing is limited by the speed of the diffusion of reactions in the medium. Researchers like Adamaztky are working on breaking this barrier: “Systems can be scaled down to the nano-scale and then everything will be fast,” he says. However, he notes that certain applications will not require higher speeds: “When reaction-diffusion computers are embedded in the human body, their speed of processing information will perfectly match natural processes.”
But in any case, Vanag explains with an example how parallel computing compensates for any speed limit: if a micro-oscillator—equivalent to a processor—occupies a cubic volume of 100 microns on each side, a single cubic centimetre could contain a million of them, all working in parallel. Thus, “we can increase the number of micro-oscillators by many orders of magnitude and overcome the speed of conventional computers,” he says. Say goodbye to Moore’s law; with chemical computing, a small increase in volume is enough to multiply the processing capacity. This is the secret of the human brain, slower than any computer, but more powerful than all of them.

A new artificial-intelligence
In addition, chemical computing brings other crucial advantages. “It should work without electricity,” says Vanag. “No viruses, autonomous regime of working, and extremely high efficiency.” And all this while using just a few cheap chemical reagents. Thanks to these qualities, chemical computing is emerging as a promising alternative to simulate the human brain. By building bottom-up systems, starting with small oscillator networks and adding more and more layers of complexity, scientists are learning how cognitive functions such as image recognition or decision making appear.
Of course, a consequence of this chemical recreation of the brain would be the possibility of obtaining new artificial-intelligence systems, but radically different from what we usually envision: imagine robots made of gel, without a defined shape, capable of dividing themselves into smaller ones so that each one of them works independently. Perhaps they’ll even be embedded in our own bodies, analysing our biological parameters, curing our diseases. “But this is a fantasy,” concludes Vanag. “At the moment.”

Many large newsrooms and news agencies have, for some time, relegated sports, weather, stock exchange movements and corporate performance stories to computers. Surprisingly, machines can be more rigorous and comprehensive than some reporters. Unlike many journalists who often single-source stories, software can import data from various sources, recognize trends and patterns and, using Natural Language Processing, put those trends into context, constructing sophisticated sentences with adjectives, metaphors and similes. Robots can now convincingly report on crowd emotions in a tight soccer match.
These developments are why many in the journalistic profession fear Artificial Intelligence will leave them without a job. But, if instead of fearing it, journalists embrace AI, it could become the savior of the trade — making it possible for them to better cover the increasingly complex, globalized and information-rich world we live in.
Intelligent machines can turbo-power journalists’ reporting, creativity and ability to engage audiences. Following predictable data patterns and programmed to “learn” variations in these patterns over time, an algorithm can help reporters arrange, sort and produce content at a speed never thought possible. It can systematize data to find a missing link in an investigative story. It can identify trends and spot the outlier among millions of data points that could be the beginnings of a great scoop. For example, nowadays, a media outlet can continuously feed public procurement data into an algorithm which has the ability to cross-reference this data against companies sharing the same address. Perfecting this system could give reporters many clues as to where corruption may be happening in a given country.
Algorithms help reporters systematize data to find missing links in an investigative story or identify trends among millions of data points that could be the start of a scoop.
Not only can intelligent computers analyze huge amounts of data to aid timely investigations, they can also help source and fact-check stories from the crowd to see if contributions are reliable. According to a 2017 Tow Centre Report, several media outlets in the United States are already using AI to fact-check. Reuters, for example, is using News Tracer to track breaking news on social media and verify the integrity of tweets. Serenata de Amor, a group of technology enthusiasts and journalists from Brazil, uses a robot named Rosie to track every reimbursement claimed by the country’s members of Congress and highlights the reasons that make some of the expenditures suspicious.
There are many other ways in which algorithms are helping journalists, from making rough cuts of videos, to recognizing voice patterns and identifying faces in a crowd. They can be programmed to chat with readers (chatbots) and answer queries. The tricky part is that this process cannot happen without a human journalist present who, with a goal in mind, asks relevant questions about the data. Reporters and editors need to learn fast how these systems operate and how they can use them to enhance their journalism.
Most journalists in the world do not have access to a team of programmers or data scientists to help design and build their projects. Collaboration is the answer. Small newsrooms and freelancers can make up for the lack of resources by teaming up with software developers to help build a more permanent collaboration. They can also become perceptive in spotting the many open-source search and analytics tools available.
Communication between journalists and techies is not a given. It needs a lot of learning from both sides and some trial and error. With ongoing technological development, journalists now have an ever-expanding toolkit in which to hold power to account. With this increased capacity to listen to their communities and identify their needs, it would be a tremendous waste not to try.
Ethical Challenges

The readers’ editor of The Guardian, Paul Chadwick, writing about the relationship between journalism and Artificial Intelligence, proposes a new clause for the newspaper’s code of ethics.
“Software that ‘thinks’ is increasingly useful, but it does not necessarily gather or process information ethically,” he warns. “When using Artificial Intelligence to augment your journalism, consider its compatibility with the values of this code.”
Journalists have to be aware that algorithms may lie or mislead. They have been programmed by humans, who have biases, and logical patterns may lead to the wrong conclusions. This means journalists will always need to check results with their century-old verification techniques: cross-checking sources, comparing documents, doubting their findings.
With technological development, journalists have an ever-expanding toolkit in which to hold power to account. But we also have to be aware that algorithms may be biased.
Transparency is another must for journalism in this new era of machine intelligence.
“The biggest stumbling block for the entrance of AI into newsrooms is transparency. Transparency, a basic journalistic value, is often at odds with Artificial Intelligence, which usually works behind the scenes,” says Nausicaa Renner, digital editor of the Columbia Journalism Review.
Media should let its audience know what personal data it is collecting if it wants to remain credible. Despite the powerful new toys allowing them to cater precisely to their audiences’ taste, editors should also strive to inform users about what they don’t want to know. The public interest is still the media’s business and the key to its survival.
By the same token, investigative reporters should do their best to explain how they are using algorithms to find patterns or process evidence for a story, if they want to be different from the manipulators and demagogues who secretly collect data for use as a commercial or political weapon. Moreover, healthy journalism should continue to bring to life those silenced voices and intractable issues around which no one has systematically collected information or built data sets.
In the end, while it is true that AI enables journalism as never before, it is also true that this brings new challenges for learning and accountability. Without journalistic clarity, all this technology will not lead to a well-informed society. Without ethics, intelligent technology could herald journalism’s demise. Without clear purposes, transparent processes and the public interest as a compass, journalism will lose the credibility of people, no matter how many charts, bots and whistles you adorn it with.
How AI is Used in Journalism
Image: Screenshot / AP’s Wordsmith Explainer Video
Automated journalism: producing stories from data. Initially it was used in reporting on sports and financial news. It can free journalists from routine tasks, improving efficiency and cost-cutting. AP uses Wordsmith software to turn financial data into stories. The Washington Post uses in house developed technology Heliograf for reporting on sports events and electoral races.
Organizing workflow: tracking down breaking news, aggregating and organizing news using tags and links, moderating comments and using automated voice transcription. The New York Times uses the Perspective API tool developed by Jigsaw (Alphabet) to moderate readers’ comments. The Reuters Connect platform for journalists displays all Reuters content, including the archive, and content from media partners around the world in real time.
Tracking news on social media: analyzing real time and historical data, identifying influencers and engaging with audiences. AP uses Newswhip to monitor social media trends and increase engagement.
Engaging with audiences: Quartz Bot studio’s chatbot app allows users to text questions about news events, people, or places, and the app replies with content it believes is be relevant to them. Others include bots for Facebook Messenger such as Guardian. The BBC used bots to help cover the EU referendum. The AfriBOT project, one of the Innovate Africa grant winners, by the European Journalism Centre and The Source (Namibia and Zimbabwe), are developing an open source newsbot “to help African news organizations deliver personalized news and engage more effectively with audiences via messaging platforms.”.
Chequeado’s fact-checking bot mascot.
Automated fact-checking: allows journalists a speedy fact check of public statements or claims. Chequeabot is used by Chequeado in Argentina; Full Fact UK and partners are developing an automated fact-checking engine that “will spot claims that have already been fact-checked in new places; and it will automatically detect and check new claims using Natural Language Processing and structured data.” The Duke Reporter’s Lab in the US developed the tool ClaimBuster to deliver politically meaningful claims to media and, in 2017, launched a hub for automated fact-checking projects. Factmata in the UK is also developing an automated fact-checking tool. Read more about automated fact-checking.
Analyzing large data bases: software crunches data and looks for patterns, changes or anything unusual. Reuters’ Lynx Insight goes through massive data sets and provides journalists with results and background information. OCCRP’s Crime Pattern Recognition uses technology that analyzes large databases of documents for similar corruption-related crimes and links between involved parties.
Image recognition: technology that recognises objects, places, human faces and even sentiment in images. The New York Times uses Amazon’s Rekognition API to identify members of congress in photos. Any user can test Google’s Vision API image recognition technology for free.
Video production: automatically creates scripts from news articles and produces narrated rough cuts of short video pieces from video footage. Wibbitz software is used by USA Today, Bloomberg and NBC. Researchers at Stanford University are developing an automated video editing tool.

Young and Betsy Corcoran (Columnist)     Jan 23, 2019 Derek Li, co-founder of Squirrel AI, addressing an AI summit.TweetShareEmailTweetShareEmailThis article is part of the collection: The EdSurge Podcast.We can build robot teachers, or even robot teaching assistants. But should we? And if the answer is yes, what’s the right mix of human and machine in the classroom?To get a fresh perspective on that question, this episode we take you to China, where a couple of us from EdSurge recently traveled for a reporting trip. One of the events we attended was a two-day conference about artificial intelligence in education organized by a company called Squirrel AI.Its vision felt unusually utopian. The company’s co-founder, Derek Li, said during a keynote that replacing some teaching functions with AI-powered software would supercharge the country’s education system. Speaking to a crowd of some 2,000 attendees, he said: “If our children are educated by AI teachers, then their potential can be fully realized.”Li mentioned that he has two young sons, twins, he said, who are very different from each other. And he believes that having AI-driven tutors or instructors will help them each get the individual approach they need. He closed his remarks by saying that he “hopes to provide each child with a super-power AI teacher that is the combination of Einstein and Socrates, that way it feels like she has more than 100 teachers in front of her.”To understand that level of enthusiasm for AI, it’s useful to give some context. For starters, the Chinese government has declared a national goal of surpassing the U.S. in AI technology by the year 2030, so there is almost a Sputnik-like push for the tech going on right now in China. At the same time, China is also facing a shortage of qualified teachers in many rural areas, and there’s a huge demand for high-quality language teachers and tutors throughout the country. So in that context, there’s probably more openness there than in the U.S. to the idea of bringing in robots for some teaching functions.But Li painted AI as not just some pale substitute, but as ultimately superior to humans when it comes to some aspects of teaching. Much of what he described was not the company’s current product, but its vision of where it wants to go, including a plan to create an AI-powered tutor that teaches kids to be more creative. So far the company says it runs 1,600 learning centers in more than 300 cities across China.
 
 We were curious to talk with Li further about his thoughts, we sat down with him just after the event to learn about his dreams and concerns about the role of AI in classrooms.EdSurge: You said that you're using human teachers to understand how they teach, and that sometimes you learn they don't use the most efficient paths in delivering information. In three years' time, what will be the role of human teachers? Will we need them?Li: Machines always take human jobs, right? Now, the teacher is like the farmers in the field; we need AI to become a harvester. But I don't think the teachers will lose their job. I think the machine will part of the teaching job, but most of the job of a teacher [which humans are not doing well] are actually more important, for example communicating with students one-on-one and understanding students' emotion, their character, how to build their characters. That’s what the [human] teachers can do best, but they need a lot of time to do that. Most of teachers are busy with teaching [knowledge and academics].If computers can know so much—and you’re saying they can eventually know everything—and people can only know a little bit, are we training our students to be like only a small part of a computer? Should we be training them entirely differently if they will only ever know a tiny bit of what the computers can learn?I think that knowledge learning [just teaching facts and information] will become less important.But that's what your company does some of, so if that is less important, then how does that work?It's in the middle of a transition. That's why we let our machines grow AI to teach students ways of thinking.All technology has implications, but sometimes negative ones too. What do you worry about with AI becoming so important in education?Actually, the thing I worry about is most is [the AI teachers] getting out of control. When we are in a classroom, we know what the teacher knows and we know what the teacher will teach us. Even if they know something that's not proper, maybe dirty, they will not dare to teach it in class. For the computer, they know everything. They know every information, and if they want to please the student, sometimes that might not be a good thing.They could teach them the wrong thing?Yeah, they may teach the wrong thing. So how do we restrain, how do we limit it?It's just like the control of the nuclear weapon, right? To use it to build electricity, that's good. But other uses will be a disaster. So how to regulate AI is very important.Are there any experiments that you're trying to think about to regulate AI?Not now, because currently what the machine can learn from us is quite controlled.But I talked with [a researcher] at Carnegie Mellon University and he has a fabulous idea of how AI could evolve. He said before, algorithms would learn and evolve by themselves. But if we use the right human machine language, we could let every person teach the machine.For example, if a GPS leads you the wrong way or in the wrong direction, you can teach it where the right thing is and you correct it. If everybody can teach the machine, the machine will become smarter and smarter very quickly. For Squirrel AI, maybe 80 percent of the time it's very efficient. But for say 10 percent of occasions, it may be very horribly stupid. AI is kind of like that, like a GPS it can take you to the wrong place.If we can let every student and let every parent, and every teacher nearby teach the machine, it can get smarter very quick. But, that’s also the danger. If the machine can learn from the internet and if everybody teaches the machine, that would be out of control. How do we evaluate everything, and how do we decide what is right and what is wrong? I think we need an AI police officer.Betsy Corcoran (@betsy_) is co-founder and CEO of EdSurge.Jeffrey R.

These high-risk jobs – meaning that 70 percent of their tasks are automatable – tend to involve ""routine,"" predictable tasks and often don't require a bachelor's degree, according to the nonprofit public policy group based in Washington, D.C.These occupations requiring less than a bachelor's degree have an average automation potential of 55 percent, while jobs requiring at least a bachelor's degree average a 24 percent chance of becoming automated.Some of the jobs with the highest risk of being automated include cooks, waiters, short-haul truck drivers and clerical office workers. Artificial intelligence is expected to have a major impact on the nation, but some areas of the country are more vulnerable to automation than others, depending on residents' education levels and the industries that drive a community's economy. The effects of AI don't vary greatly by state, but are more pronounced at the local level. Among the nation's 100 largest metro areas, these 10 are expected to be hit the hardest by AI:


Metro Area
Average Automation Potential 


Toledo, OH
49.0%


Greensboro-High Point, NC 
48.5%


Lakeland-Winter Haven, FL 
48.5%


Stockton-Lodi, CA
48.3%


Las Vegas-Henderson-Paradise, NV
48.2%


Winston-Salem, NC
48.1%


Grand Rapids-Wyoming, MI 
48.0%


Louisville/Jefferson County, KY-IN
47.9%


Scranton--Wilkes-Barre--Hazleton, PA 
47.8%


Fresno, CA 
47.8%


The study's authors note how communities with high educational attainment not only tend to have jobs that are more complex and interpersonal – and therefore less likely to be automated – but that they are also more adaptable in the face of AI. According to the report, ""educational attainment improved individual and city adaptability in the face of shocks.""Here are the large metro areas where jobs are expected to be impacted the least by AI: 


Metro Area
Average Automation Potential 


Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV
39.8%


San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, CA
40.4%


New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA
42.2%


Durham-Chapel Hill, NC 
42.4%


Boston-Cambridge-Newton, MA-NH
42.6%


Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk, CT
42.6%


San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA 
42.8%


Albany-Schenectady-Troy, NY
43.0%


Albuquerque, NM 
43.3%


Raleigh, NC 
43.3%


The report also describes how men and racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to lose their job to automation.

These high-risk jobs – meaning that 70 percent of their tasks are automatable – tend to involve ""routine,"" predictable tasks and often don't require a bachelor's degree, according to the nonprofit public policy group based in Washington, D.C.These occupations requiring less than a bachelor's degree have an average automation potential of 55 percent, while jobs requiring at least a bachelor's degree average a 24 percent chance of becoming automated.Some of the jobs with the highest risk of being automated include cooks, waiters, short-haul truck drivers and clerical office workers. Artificial intelligence is expected to have a major impact on the nation, but some areas of the country are more vulnerable to automation than others, depending on residents' education levels and the industries that drive a community's economy. The effects of AI don't vary greatly by state, but are more pronounced at the local level. Among the nation's 100 largest metro areas, these 10 are expected to be hit the hardest by AI:Metro AreaAverage Automation Potential Toledo, OH49.0%Greensboro-High Point, NC 48.5%Lakeland-Winter Haven, FL 48.5%Stockton-Lodi, CA48.3%Las Vegas-Henderson-Paradise, NV48.2%Winston-Salem, NC48.1%Grand Rapids-Wyoming, MI 48.0%Louisville/Jefferson County, KY-IN47.9%Scranton--Wilkes-Barre--Hazleton, PA 47.8%Fresno, CA 47.8%The study's authors note how communities with high educational attainment not only tend to have jobs that are more complex and interpersonal – and therefore less likely to be automated – but that they are also more adaptable in the face of AI. According to the report, ""educational attainment improved individual and city adaptability in the face of shocks.""Here are the large metro areas where jobs are expected to be impacted the least by AI: Metro AreaAverage Automation Potential Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV39.8%San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, CA40.4%New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA42.2%Durham-Chapel Hill, NC 42.4%Boston-Cambridge-Newton, MA-NH42.6%Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk, CT42.6%San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA 42.8%Albany-Schenectady-Troy, NY43.0%Albuquerque, NM 43.3%Raleigh, NC 43.3%The report also describes how men and racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to lose their job to automation. The average male worker holds a job where nearly 43 percent of tasks are automatable, while that figure is less than 40 percent for the average woman's job. Hispanic workers face the highest risk of losing their jobs to technology, with the average worker holding a job where 47 percent of their job is automatable, compared to 40 percent for whites.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The 2019 Consumer Electronics Show featured all sorts of new and cool stuff, from big and beautiful televisions that roll up from a box to all sorts of voice-activated home comfort and security devices. Flipping switches, pushing buttons, and even typing inputs now all seem to be just a few years from oil lanterns and hanging clothes on a line.

Oh, there were a few throwback items scattered about, such as old-timey phonographs that plug into your home theater via bluetooth, and apparently Pong is trying to make a high-tech comeback although I have my doubts as to whether anybody seriously missed it in the first place. But these exhibits were very few and very far between and, oh, and if you are curious then I'll advise that I didn't see any wireless 8-track players (don't forget the matchbook) or hints that Intellivision is about to make a high-tech comeback.
There were also a lot of exhibits for something that couldn't be seen, because it simply doesn't exist in any hard physical sense, and can be gauged only by its uses. These were the artificial intelligent (AI) exhibits, which were abundant if sometimes difficult to understand other than by their functions. If nothing else is clear about artificial intelligence, it is that many trillions of dollars and other currencies are being pumped into the worldwide artificial intelligence sector. If you want to know what the ""next internet"" is, you need to look no further than artificial intelligence.
PROMOTED
Artificial intelligence is something that science fiction writers have talked about since, well, there was science fiction. Suffice it to say that a wide gulf exists between the public's perception of artificial intelligence and what it really is. Bear with me while I attempt my explanation.

Computers are simply machines that follow instruction sets known as algorithms, and which is popularly referred to as software so as to distinguish those instructions from the physical computer that actually runs the instruction sets which is the hardware. The instruction sets are drafted by an alleged species of humans known as programmers, and the computer can do no more than what the programmers draft the software to do. In other words, the software has no ability to do anything like learn or intellectually grow by itself, and even slight changes require some human input.
But what if the software designed by the humans enabled the computer to draft and run its own programs so as to take into account new conditions and events? Once the computer gains this capability, you have artificial intelligence. Some artificial intelligence programs are quite simple and have an almost insect-like intelligence: They can learn very basic tasks by themselves -- such as a self-driving car learning to move around objects -- but in the big scheme of things are quite limited in how far they can engage in self-programming.

Other artificial intelligence programs are quite sophisticated and can self-draft their own programs to where they learn in a very human-like way. But there is a enormous difference: Computers with artificial intelligence can access and download huge amounts of data error-free in a way that it would take a human literally years to learn. For instance, an artificial intelligence computer could access literally every medical text every written, analyze symptoms and offer a prognosis, and suggest the best medicines and treatments. If you think this is some sort of future fantasy, you're wrong.
That is as far as I am going to stray into the technology, which is not the point of this article. What I am going to talk about is how artificial intelligence is posed to take over the financial advisery sector in the very near future.
The job of a financial adviser is to take the client's information, and then come up with a financial plan that is based on the adviser's knowledge of the economy and markets as applied to the client's needs. This is exactly the sort of thing for which it is relatively easy for artificial intelligence to do much better.
The quality of the financial adviser's advice will depend to a significant extent upon how well the financial adviser can keep up on economic factors and market data. Here, the financial adviser has the standard limitations of a human: He can only take in so much data to begin with, and read only so many financial newspapers and look at so many computer screens on a given day. By contrast, artificial intelligence can easily digest all financial historical data, determine historic trends, and access each and every current source of information to have an up-the-second understanding of the markets. Here, simply stated, the human financial has no chance against artificial intelligence.
Where the financial adviser has a chance today against artificial intelligence is being able to meet with clients, get to know them socially, and get a feeling about what their real needs are. For instance, a client may say that they want to maximize the amount of money that they give to their kids, but really they are worried about having sufficient assets to get them through retirement without having to consume cat food. As we sit here today, artificial intelligence cannot yet equate with the financial adviser in understanding those purely human nuances.
However, because artificial intelligence learns so quickly, and learns from a bunch of humans at once, that gap in understanding those peculiar human nuances is closing fast.
To illustrate the speed of this learning, consider something that happens with self-driving vehicles: If a teenage driver has an accident while driving, only that particular teenage driver learns from her mistake. By contrast, if a self-driving vehicle has an accident, then every vehicle in the fleet learns from that mistake.
Because artificial intelligence learns so much faster than humans, it is simply a matter of time before artificial intelligence can read human nuances and have an emotional intelligence quotient that exceeds those of most humans. When that happens, in the next few years, financial advisers will have a hard time competing based on personal relationships.
For clients, the benefits of their financial adviser being artificial intelligence will be enormous.
Most financial advisers meet with their clients no more than every six months, and maybe have a few telephone calls in the interim. By contrast, AI is always on. If there is a financial issue that is keeping you up on a particular night, AI is there and immediately available to chat no matter the time.
Along these same lines, AI will manage financial matters instantaneously. For example, assume that a client has an asset allocation of X% into large-cap stocks. If necessary, AI can rebalance the portfolio to stay close to X% on a second-by-second basis if needed. By contrast, a financial adviser might not even look at a particular client's portfolio until the next six-month review, at which point it might be more costly to rebalance the client's large-cap stock holdings.
AI can also keep instantaneously up-to-date with the last economic data showing certain expenses. Have a 529 plan set up to send little Tommy to college? Your AI adviser can instantly keep up on projected tuition and other expenses and alert you when you are contributing too little or too much. The same will be true for retirement plans. Contrast this with human financial advisers, too many of whom take a ""fire and forget"" approach to such planning, i.e., the assumptions made on Day 1 of the plan are the assumptions that will remain the same for the next 20 years.
Another area where AI will excel is in the area of tax efficiency. AI can quite easily hold the entire Internal Revenue Code in its mind, and perform instant calculations on whether things are held in the most tax-efficient vehicle, such as a Roth IRA, etc., and make suggestions based on tax efficiency. By contrast, this is an area where financial advisers struggle to keep up with just the most basic rules and changes to those rules, and too often give outdated advice.
Perhaps the greatest benefit for clients will be in the elimination of human faults. Financial advisers are not completely immune from the twin killers of investors known as despair and euphoria: Despair when the market is going down, and euphoria when the market is going up, both of which can quickly destroy investment discipline. Financial advisers may not be as susceptible to these emotions as their non-professional clients, but it is probably impossible for them to completely clear their minds as to what is going on in the markets. AI will not suffer from either despair or euphoria.
The worst human fault, though, is simple greed. Far too many financial advisers make commission-driven decisions, putting their clients into loaded but mediocre-performing funds and driving them into high-commission life insurance and annuity products. Suffice it to say that AI doesn't have much interest in a golf junket to Scotland for big producers, or in putting clients into whole life insurance products because they pay twice as much commission (around 80% of first year's premiums) as UL products (around 40% of first year's premiums). Nor will AI embezzle client funds and then take off for Costa Rica.
There is a risk, of course, of built-in bias in AI of which the base program is drafted by humans. But there is also the possibility of giving AI the power to self-police itself against such bias by instructing AI to create its own programs to root out, identify, and eliminate such bias. We'll have to see how all this develops, but suffice it to say that I don't expect security regulators to be in the forefront of AI financial adviser development.
All I can say for now is that AI financial advisers are already here in some small part, and are quite likely to take over the sector entirely within the next decade.
And that's a very good thing for clients.

Despite efficiency increases and lessening the need for manual laborers, companies require workers who can program, oversee, operate, and maintain the automation. A report by Deloitte Consulting and the American Manufacturing Institute estimates 2 million such jobs will need to be filled over the next decade.ASSOCIATED PRESSA.J. Scherman, 37, left, works with fellow apprentice Ryan Buzzy, 18, right, on a robotics control computer at a chainsaw assembly line at a Stihl Inc. production plant in Virginia Beach, Va. Scherman, with only a high-school degree, wanted to earn more money when his daughter was born and took a chance with a mid-life career change. Scherman is earning a college degree as part of a Stihl apprenticeship and will finish debt-free thanks to financial aid provided by the company. “We’re safe, because we’re the guys who fix the robots when they malfunction,” Sherman said. “We’re going to need people to fix the more advanced systems. This program trains us.”ASSOCIATED PRESSA robotic forklift autonomously transports materials throughout a Stihl Inc. production plant in Virginia Beach, Va.

There are assembly lines at the Stihl plant, but human workers are interspersed with computers and robotics. Two robot arms in one corner of the plant tie cords to the black pull handles used to start the company’s outdoor power tools, a mundane job formerly done by people. With the efficiency gains comes a calmer, more open and orderly workspace that contrasts with the traditional stereotype of chaotic, dirty manufacturing plants.ASSOCIATED PRESSRobots are used to move merchandise and fulfull orders at modern fulfullment centers such as Robbinsville.Courtesy Of AmazonRobots are used to move merchandise and fulfull orders at modern fulfullment centers such as Robbinsville.Courtesy Of AmazonWorkers exchange spools of thread as a robot picks up thread made from recycled plastic bottles at the Repreve Bottle Processing Center, part of the Unifi textile company in Yadkinville, N.C.ASSOCIATED PRESSEquipment to sort recycled plastic is shown at the Repreve Bottle Processing Center, part of the Unifi textile company in Reidsville, N.C.ASSOCIATED PRESSRecycled plastic chips is packed into bags for delivery at the Repreve Bottle Processing Center, part of the Unifi textile company in Reidsville, N.C.ASSOCIATED PRESSA worker loads spools of thread at the Repreve Bottle Processing Center, part of the Unifi textile company in Yadkinville, N.C.ASSOCIATED PRESS",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
