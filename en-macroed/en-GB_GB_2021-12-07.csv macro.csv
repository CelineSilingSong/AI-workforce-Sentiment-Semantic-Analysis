</li>
</ul>

<p>The Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation (CDEI), the government expert body enabling trustworthy innovation in data and AI, has set out the steps required to build a world-leading AI assurance ecosystem in the UK.</p>

<p>The roadmap, which was a commitment in the UK’s <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-ai-strategy"" class=""govuk-link"">National AI Strategy</a>, follows calls from public bodies including the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/artificial-intelligence-and-public-standards-report"" class=""govuk-link"">Committee on Standards in Public Life</a>, and <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/15/1016183/ai-ethics-startups/"" class=""govuk-link"">industry</a>, to build an ecosystem of tools and services that can identify and mitigate the range of risks posed by AI and drive trustworthy adoption. It addresses one of the biggest issues in AI governance identified by international organisations including the <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.gpai.ai/projects/responsible-ai/gpai-responsible-ai-wg-report-november-2020.pdf"" class=""govuk-link"">Global Partnership on AI, OECD</a> and <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/09/how-to-put-ai-ethics-into-practice-in-12-steps/"" class=""govuk-link"">World Economic Forum</a>.</p>

<p>Assurance services - like audit, certification and impact assessments - are common in other sectors, such as financial services and cybersecurity. These tools ensure that complex products are trustworthy and compliant with regulation, improving organisations’ confidence to invest and delivering better outcomes for consumers. But assurance services for AI are currently relatively undeveloped.</p>

<p>The roadmap, which is the first of its kind, brings coherence to a fragmented and nascent ecosystem. It sets out the roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders, and identifies six priority areas for action:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
<strong>Generate demand for reliable and effective assurance</strong> across the AI supply chain, improving understanding of risks, as well as accountabilities for mitigating them</li>
  <li>
<strong>Build a dynamic, competitive AI assurance market</strong>, that provides a range of effective services and tools</li>
  <li>
<strong>Develop standards</strong> that provide a common language for AI assurance</li>
  <li>
<strong>Build an accountable AI assurance profession</strong> to ensure that AI assurance services are also trustworthy and high quality</li>
  <li>
<strong>Support organisations to meet regulatory obligations</strong> by setting requirements that can be assured against</li>
  <li>
<strong>Improve links between industry and independent researchers</strong>, so that researchers can help develop assurance techniques and identify AI risks</li>
</ol>

<p>The CDEI’s research demonstrates that there is an opportunity for the UK to be a world leader in AI assurance, drawing on its strengths in legal and professional services, AI research and standards. It points to the leading role that the UK could play in developing and shaping global technical standards, which - alongside an effective ecosystem of assurance products and services - would facilitate cross-border trade by enabling interoperability between different regulatory regimes. Moreover, based on the growth of comparable industries, such as the <a rel=""external"" href=""https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/957960/UK_Cyber_Sectoral_Analysis__2020__Report_V2.pdf"" class=""govuk-link"">£4 billion cyber assurance industry</a>, a mature AI assurance ecosystem has the potential to be a multi-billion pound industry in its own right, unlocking growth and thousands of job opportunities. The CDEI envisages that the UK will have a thriving AI assurance ecosystem within the next 5 years, with professional services firms providing a range of services alongside innovative start-ups and scale-ups.</p>

<p>The CDEI will take a number of steps over the next year to deliver on the roadmap, along with partners across industry, regulators and government. It will support DCMS and the Office for Artificial Intelligence as they work with stakeholders to pilot an AI Standards Hub, which will expand the UK’s contribution to global AI standards. It will also partner with professional bodies and regulators in the UK to set out assurable standards and requirements for AI systems; and convene stakeholders, including through an AI assurance accreditation forum, which will bring together professional and accreditation bodies who need to play a role in the professionalisation of AI assurance.</p>

<p>The CDEI is actively looking to partner with organisations to deliver on the roadmap. The announcement follows the publication of <a rel=""external"" href=""https://www.rec.uk.com/data-driven-tools-recruitment-guidance"" class=""govuk-link"">new guidance</a> on the use of AI in recruitment, developed by the CDEI in partnership with the Recruitment and Employment Confederation. The CDEI is also working with the government’s Centre for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles to embed ethical due diligence in the future regulatory framework for self-driving vehicles, a <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-on-the-cusp-of-a-transport-revolution-as-self-driving-vehicles-set-to-be-worth-nearly-42-billion-by-2035"" class=""govuk-link"">market set to be worth £42 billion by 2035</a>.</p>

<p>Chris Philp MP, Minister for Technology and the Digital Economy at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">AI has the potential to transform our society and economy; and help us tackle some of the greatest challenges of our time. However, this will only be possible if we are able to manage the risks posed by AI and build public trust in its use. In the National AI Strategy, we committed to establishing the most trusted and pro-innovation system for AI governance in the world and building an effective AI assurance ecosystem in the UK will be critical to realising this mission. I’m delighted to see the CDEI’s roadmap published today, and look forward to working with stakeholders, from standards bodies to professional services firms, to make the vision the CDEI has set out a reality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>George Freeman MP, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State in the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">From medical diagnostics to machine learning to climate science, AI is fast becoming key to our economy and society. Next generation AI computing can deliver superfast decision support software, developing large benefits for industry and public services. The UK is one of the world’s most advanced AI economies but public trust and data governance regulation are key to ensure AI systems are effective and trustworthy. Today’s new AI roadmap – the first in the world – sets out how we can establish proper assurance and governance systems to unlock AI’s full potential and develop a truly competitive edge as we build back better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rumman Chowdhury, Director of Machine Learning Ethics, Transparency and Accountability at Twitter and Member of the CDEI’s Advisory Board, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">AI presents a myriad of opportunities, but there are a range of harms that need to be addressed if we are to seize them. In order to achieve that goal, we need a thriving ecosystem of assurance products and services that can check AI systems are trustworthy and beneficial to all. The CDEI’s roadmap makes a significant, early contribution to shaping and bringing coherence to this much-needed ecosystem, by setting out the roles that different groups will need to play, as well as the next steps that need to be taken.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Antony Walker, Deputy CEO of techUK, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">Today’s publication marks a key first step in operationalising the UK’s National AI Strategy and the UK leading the way in how a world-leading AI assurance ecosystem and market can become a reality. We welcome the roadmap’s ambition to give industry access to the tools and expertise needed to help build greater confidence along the AI supply chain, including amongst customers and citizens. But as this work moves forward, we must work hard together to ensure assurance checks are genuinely pro-innovation, proportionate and well aligned with existing standards and regulation. We look forward to working with the CDEI to deliver on the roadmap and continue to make the UK a world-leader in the development of trustworthy AI.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Matthew Fell, Chief Policy Director at the Confederation of British Industry, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">The UK is starting from a position of strength in the global race to become a world-leader in AI. These steps being taken by the government will help to embed trust in how AI is deployed, and support more businesses across the economy to capitalise on new opportunities. Ensuring we get the right AI governance in place will be essential to realising a pro-innovation UK.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr Scott Steedman CBE, Director-General of Standards at the British Standards Institution, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class=""last-child"">We welcome the plans set out in the UK government’s roadmap to build a world-leading AI assurance ecosystem. Standards are a vital tool to build trust in products and services, accelerate innovation and manage risk. In our role as the UK’s National Standards Body, we have a track record of developing standards for the governance of new and emerging technology, such as AI, as it is brought to market. We will continue to work closely with government, industry and consumers to ensure consensus-based standards of good practice will unlock the potential of AI for the good of our economy and society.</p>

Artificial Intelligence in the Metaverse: Bridging the Virtual and Real
Investigating five use case for AI in the Metaverse

Virtual RealityInsights 

Published: December 9, 2021





 XR Today Team



Artificial intelligence (AI) applications are now much more common than you might think. In a recent McKinsey survey, 50% of respondents said that their companies use AI for at least one business function. A Deloitte report found that 40% of enterprises have an organisation-wide AI strategy in place. In consumer-facing applications too, AI now plays a major role via facial recognition, natural language processing (NLP), faster computing, and all sorts of other under-the-hood processes.  It was only a matter of time until AI was applied to augmented and virtual reality to build smarter immersive worlds.  AI has the potential to parse huge volumes of data at lightning speed to generate insights and drive action. Users can either leverage AI for decision-making (which is the case for most enterprise applications), or link AI with automation for low touch processes. The metaverse will use augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) in combination with artificial intelligence and blockchain to create scalable and accurate virtual worlds.  What Is the Metaverse and Why Does it Need AI? The metaverse is defined as an expansive virtual space where users can interact with 3D digital objects and 3D virtual avatars of each other in a complex manner that mimics the real world.The idea of the metaverse was first coined by science fiction writer Neal Stephenson in the early 90s and was eventually developed in parts by companies like Second Life, Decentraland, Microsoft, and most recently Meta (formerly Facebook).  Now, Facebook is well recognised for its work in artificial intelligence and sophisticated AI algorithms. The company’s AI research spans diverse areas like content analysis, self-supervised speech processing, robotic interactions, computer vision, whole-body pose estimation, and much more. All of this could inform the company’s future direction as Meta and drive the foundations of its own version of the metaverse.  5 AI Use Cases in the Metaverse While VR worlds can technically exist without artificial intelligence, the combination of the two unlocks a whole new degree of verisimilitude. This could impact the following five use cases: Accurate avatar creationUsers are at the centre of the metaverse and your avatar’s accuracy will determine the quality of experience for you and other participants. An AI engine can analyse 2D user images or 3D scans to come up with a highly realistic simulated rendition. It can then plot a variety of facial expressions, emotions, hairstyles, features brought on by aging, etc. to make the avatar more dynamic. Companies like Ready Player Me are already using AI to help build avatars for the metaverse, and Meta is working on its own version of the technology. Digital humansDigital humans are 3D versions of chatbots that exist in the metaverse. They aren’t replicas of another person, really – instead, they are more like AI-enabled non-playing characters (NPCs) in a video game that can react and respond to your actions in a VR world. 



Digital humans are built entirely using AI tech, and are essential to the landscape of the metaverse. From NPCs in gameplay to automated assistants in VR workplaces, there are myriad applications, and companies like Unreal Engine and Soul Machines have already invested in this direction. Multilingual accessibilityOne of the primary ways digital humans use AI is for language processing. Artificial intelligence can help break down natural languages like English, convert it into a machine-readable format, perform analysis, arrive at a response, convert the results back into English and send it to the user. This entire process takes a fraction of a second – just like a real conversation. The best part is that the results could be converted into any language, depending on the AI’s training so that users from around the world can access the metaverse. VR world expansion at scaleHere’s where AI really comes into its own. When an AI engine is fed with historical data, it learns from previous outputs and tries to come up with its own. The output of AI will get better each time, with new input, human feedback, as well as machine learning reinforcement. Eventually, the AI will be able to perform the task and provide output almost as well as human beings. Companies like NVIDIA are training AI to create entire virtual worlds. This breakthrough will be instrumental in driving scalability for the metaverse, as new worlds can be added without the intervention of humans.   Intuitive interfacingFinally, AI can also assist in human-computer interactions (HCI). When you put on a sophisticated, AI-enabled VR headset, its sensors will be able to read and predict your electrical and muscular patterns to know exactly how you’d want to move inside the metaverse. AI can help recreate an authentic sense of touch in VR. It can also aid in voice-enabled navigation, so you can interact with virtual objects without having to use hand controllers.  Challenges Around AI in the Metaverse It is important to keep in mind that the metaverse is a new area of research and operation, and AI implementation could run into issues. For example, there could be questions around:  
Ownership for AI-created content – Who holds the copyright to and can profit from the content and VR worlds created by AI? 
Deepfakes and user transparency – How do you ensure that users know they are interacting with AI and not other humans? How do you prevent deep fakes and fraud?  
Fair use of AI and ML – Can users legally apply AI/ML technologies to metaverse interactions? For instance, can they use AI code to win games?  
Right to use data for AI model training – How can we ethically train AI for the metaverse? What are the consent mechanisms involved?  
Accountability for AI bias – If a digital human or similar AI algorithm displays bias, what is the possible recourse?  
Ultimately, without AI, it will be difficult to create an engaging, authentic, and scalable metaverse experience. That’s why companies like Meta are working closely with think tanks and ethics groups to stem the risks of AI without curbing the technology’s potential.

    Human-Centred Artificial Intelligence for Human Resources: A Toolkit for Human Resources Professionals

Organizations are increasingly looking to harness the power of artificial intelligence to manage talent in ways that are more effective, fair, and efficient. However, the use of AI in Human Resources raises given AI’s potential for problems in areas such as data privacy and bias. The use of AI in HR also poses operational, reputational, and legal risks to organizations, especially with recent moves in several countries to regulate its use. There is therefore high interest in AI in HR but also apprehension, and organizations are looking to navigate this increasingly complex landscape.


To help organizations overcome these challenges, the World Economic Forum collaborated with over 50 experts in HR, data science, employment law, and ethics to create a practical toolkit for the responsible use of AI in this field. The toolkit begins with a guide that provides: an overview of AI in HR including a short primer on how AI works; describes key areas of concern including data privacy, bias, and transparency and explainability; and covers the steps to adopting AI-based HR tools including forming an assessment team, evaluating the risk of a tool, implementation, and monitoring. The toolkit then provides two checklists that are linked to each section of the guide. The first checklist is for the evaluation of a specific tool. The second checklist focuses on broader questions of strategic planning and the development of policies and procedures.


This project was led by World Economic Forum Fellow Professor Matissa Hollister from McGill University, in collaboration with Fellows from Baker McKenzie and New America, and the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution Turkey, an affiliate centre of the World Economic Forum established by the Turkish Employers’ Association of Metal Industries (MESS) and the Republic Of Turkey Ministry of Industry and Technology.

Language, and its role in demonstrating and facilitating comprehension - or intelligence - is a fundamental part of being human. It gives people the ability to communicate thoughts and concepts, express ideas, create memories, and build mutual understanding. These are foundational parts of social intelligence. It’s why our teams at DeepMind study aspects of language processing and communication, both in artificial agents and in humans.As part of a broader portfolio of AI research, we believe the development and study of more powerful language models – systems that predict and generate text – have tremendous potential for building advanced AI systems that can be used safely and efficiently to summarise information, provide expert advice and follow instructions via natural language. Developing beneficial language models requires research into their potential impacts, including the risks they pose. This includes collaboration between experts from varied backgrounds to thoughtfully anticipate and address the challenges that training algorithms on existing datasets can create.Today we are releasing three papers on language models that reflect this interdisciplinary approach. They include a detailed study of a 280 billion parameter transformer language model called Gopher, a study of ethical and social risks associated with large language models, and a paper investigating a new architecture with better training efficiency.Gopher - A 280 billion parameter language modelIn the quest to explore language models and develop new ones, we trained a series of transformer language models of different sizes, ranging from 44 million parameters to 280 billion parameters (the largest model we named Gopher).Our research investigated the strengths and weaknesses of those different-sized models, highlighting areas where increasing the scale of a model continues to boost performance – for example, in areas like reading comprehension, fact-checking, and the identification of toxic language. We also surface results where model scale does not significantly improve results — for instance, in logical reasoning and common-sense tasks.








Performance on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark broken down by category. Gopher improves upon prior work across several categories.



In our research, we found the capabilities of Gopher exceed existing language models for a number of key tasks. This includes the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark, where Gopher demonstrates a significant advancement towards human expert performance over prior work.As well as quantitative evaluation of Gopher, we also explored the model through direct interaction. Among our key findings was that, when Gopher is prompted towards a dialogue interaction (like in a chat), the model can sometimes provide surprising coherence.









Here Gopher can discuss cell biology and provide a correct citation despite no specific dialogue fine-tuning. However our research also detailed several failure modes that persist across model sizes, amongst them a tendency for repetition, the reflection of stereotypical biases, and the confident propagation of incorrect information.









This type of analysis is important, because understanding and documenting failure modes gives us an insight into how large language models could lead to downstream harms, and shows us where mitigation efforts in research should focus to address those issues.Ethical and social risks from Large Language ModelsIn our second paper, we anticipate possible ethical and social risks from language models, and create a comprehensive classification of these risks and failure modes, building on prior research in this area [Bommasani et al 2021, Bender et al 2021, Patterson et al 2021]. This systematic overview is an essential step towards understanding these risks and mitigating potential harm. We present a taxonomy of the risks related to language models, categorised into six thematic areas, and elaborate on 21 risks in-depth.Taking a broad view of different risk areas is essential: as we show in the paper, an overly narrow focus on a single risk in isolation can make other problems worse. The taxonomy we present serves as a foundation for experts and wider public discourse to build a shared overview of ethical and social considerations on language models, make responsible decisions, and exchange approaches to dealing with the identified risks.









Our research finds that two areas in particular require further work. First, current benchmarking tools are insufficient for assessing some important risks, for example, when language models output misinformation and people trust this information to be true. Assessing risks like these requires more scrutiny of human-computer-interaction with language models. In our paper we list several risks that similarly require novel or more interdisciplinary analysis tools. Second, more work is needed on risk mitigations. For example, language models are known to reproduce harmful social stereotypes, but research on this problem is still in early stages, as a recent DeepMind paper showed.Efficient Training with Internet-Scale RetrievalOur final paper builds on the foundations of Gopher and our taxonomy of ethical and social risk by proposing an improved language model architecture that reduces the energy cost of training and makes it easier to trace model outputs to sources within the training corpus.The Retrieval-Enhanced Transformer (RETRO) is pre-trained with an Internet-scale retrieval mechanism. Inspired by how the brain relies on dedicated memory mechanisms when learning, RETRO efficiently queries for passages of text to improve its predictions. By comparing generated texts to the passages RETRO relied upon for generation, we can interpret why the model makes certain predictions and where they came from. We also see how the model obtains comparable performance to a regular Transformer with an order of magnitude fewer parameters, and obtains state-of-the-art performance on several language modeling benchmarks.









Going forwardThese papers offer a foundation for DeepMind’s language research going forward, particularly in areas that will have a bearing on how these models are evaluated and deployed. Addressing these areas will be critical for ensuring safe interactions with AI agents – from people telling agents what they want to agents explaining their actions to people. Research in the broader community on using communication for safety includes natural language explanations, using communication to reduce uncertainty, and using language to unpack complex decisions into pieces such as amplification, debate, and recursive reward modeling -- all critical areas of exploration.As we continue our research on language models, DeepMind will remain cautious and thoughtful. This requires stepping back to assess the situation we find ourselves in, mapping out potential risks, and researching mitigations. We will strive to be transparent and open about the limitations of our models and will work to mitigate identified risks. At each step, we draw on the breadth of expertise from our multidisciplinary teams, including from our Language, Deep Learning, Ethics, and Safety teams. This approach is key to creating large language models that serve society, furthering our mission of solving intelligence to advance science and benefit humanity.

The Jackson Institute for Global Affairs announced on Tuesday that it will establish the Schmidt Program on Artificial Intelligence, Emerging Technologies and National Power, fostering interdisciplinary AI and cyber-focused research and teaching.
The Schmidt Program is a new initiative of International Security Studies at Yale, brought about by a $15.3 million gift from the Schwab Charitable Fund — through the donation of Eric and Wendy Schmidt and per the recommendation of their foundation, Schmidt Futures. The program will serve as “a hub for scholars and practitioners” to work across disciplines on research and teaching about the potential implications of emerging artificial intelligence.
“It’s an interdisciplinary program that will give the policy students better exposure to some of the technical concepts, and in the reverse, it’ll help us interact with members of the STEM community across the University, and think about how to bring those students into the mix for some of the current courses that we’re offering at Jackson,” said Ted Wittenstein, executive director of ISS. “It’ll be an opportunity to collaborate and connect across the University, which I think makes all of us excited about the opportunities ahead.”
The program was born out of “tremendous interest” among Jackson Institute students to better understand the technical knowledge behind emerging threats to international security and conversations about how trends in cybersecurity and artificial intelligence are changing the nature of world affairs, Wittenstein said. He told the News that the institute’s current class offerings in these areas are already incredibly high in demand.
The program will invite technologists and practitioners to Yale as Schmidt Program senior fellows, as well as offer postdoctoral fellowships to Schmidt visiting scholars. Some of the program’s initial research areas will include cyberwarfare, AI governance and competition in U.S.-China relations. The program will also establish new course offerings in AI and technology, in addition to hosting symposia, workshops and conferences.
As AI continues to advance, it is expected to have a profound impact on businesses in all industries. In fact, a recent AI article from entrepreneur.com highlighted how AI is changing the future of work, including improving efficiency, enhancing decision-making capabilities, and even creating new job opportunities. With the establishment of programs like the Schmidt Program at Yale, more businesses will be able to take advantage of these benefits and stay ahead of the curve in an increasingly AI-driven world.
“The Schmidt Program will help us build even more bridges across the University, expanding the scope of our collaboration to the transformational threats and opportunities associated with artificial intelligence,” Jackson Institute Director Jim Levinsohn said. “AI is reshaping our world, and it’s critical that future leaders we’re training here at Jackson understand its many implications.”
The program is made possible by the significant endowment from Eric and Wendy Schmidt. 
Eric Schmidt was the former chief executive officer of Google from 2001-11 and served as its executive chairman from 2011-18. He is currently Google’s technical advisor. Wendy Schmidt is the president of the Schmidt Family Foundation, which holds over $1 billion in philanthropic assets. Together, they co-founded Schmidt Futures in 2017. 
The chief executive officer of Schmidt Futures, Eric Braverman ’97 LAW ’02, is a lecturer at the Yale School of Management and has been a member of the Jackson Advisory Board since 2019. 
“We are excited to establish The Schmidt Program,” Eric Schmidt wrote in an email to the News. “Understanding the transition to an AI driven world, and developing a guiding ethic for it, will require commitment and insight from many elements of society: scientists and strategists, statesmen and philosophers, clerics and CEOs. Yale University brings together the best and brightest in all of these fields, forming the interdisciplinary approach that understanding AI will require.”
Eric Schmidt has also co-authored four books, including three related to the field of technology. His most recent book, “The Age of AI: Our Human Future,” was co-authored by former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and Daniel Huttenlocher.
As part of the program, Wittenstein will be teaching a new yearlong course titled “Artificial Intelligence, Emerging Technologies, and National Power” along with other faculty from the University.
“There’s a wide range of concepts here that are changing the nature of international relations, and those who aspire to policy careers … need … a technical fluency to try to grapple with these challenges,” Wittenstein said. “I think at the Jackson Institute, we instinctively think about how AI interacts with global affairs, security issues and geopolitical tensions in the U.S.-China relationship, and while those are important, there are technical, legal, ethical dimensions of these technologies that we’re eager to explore and that our students are really interested in learning more about.”
Wittenstein currently teaches undergraduate, graduate and law courses on intelligence, cybersecurity and national security decision making. He previously held positions in the U.S. Department of Defense, Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction, Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of State.
Professor of history and ISS Director Arne Westad described Wittenstein as a “significant player” in developing plans for the program.
“We wanted [the Schmidt Program] to be in the forefront of what people are researching and thinking about with regard to [AI and emerging technology],” Westad told the News. “We also did that with a view to try to think about this in ways that don’t just benefit one country: this is not a program that is designed or set up simply to look at these things from a U.S. perspective. We need to look at this from a global perspective and figure out what kind of challenges there are in a global sense.”
Westad underscored the importance of interdisciplinary study when researching and teaching emerging technologies.
“I’m constantly reminded from where I sit that intellectually and philosophically much of what we are looking at here has a background and history, which can actually tell us something about where we are today and where we might be going,” Westad said. 
Westad further added that “people who study this historically” can play an important role in better understanding past challenges. He also stressed that it is “hugely important that social scientists and humanists understand more about the technological aspects of this.”
As part of the program, a new “AI symposium” with visiting experts will be held starting in spring 2022. The symposium will involve public talks and classroom visits that are open to the wider Yale community.
The program will also co-sponsor the 2022 Yale Cyber Leadership Forum, a partnership between the Jackson Institute and Yale Law School’s Center for Global Legal Challenges. The forum, directed by law professor Oona Hathaway LAW ’97, will invite attorneys, entrepreneurs, policymakers and academics to explore the national security implications of AI development.
“The Schmidt program will give us the resources we need to invest in scholarship and teaching on emerging technologies — including artificial intelligence and cyber,” Hathaway wrote in an email to the News. “Jackson is a particularly good home for this program, because it serves as a kind of cross-roads for the University, bringing together scholars and students from a range of fields, from Law to Political Science to Engineering to Computer Science to Data Sciences.”
Professor of computer science Joan Feigenbaum emphasized the significance of this program to the study of technology at Yale.
According to Feigenbaum, the “interplay” between AI and international relations — and more broadly between computer science and politics — has been increasingly important on the global stage.
“There is a great deal of student interest in the topic here at Yale, and the Schmidt program will provide resources and opportunities for the development of new courses and new interdisciplinary research projects,” Feigenbaum wrote in an email to the News.
Eric Schmidt echoed Feigenbaum’s sentiments and said that the upcoming opening of the Jackson School of Global Affairs inspired the “opportunity to design the curriculum for the 21st century rather than the 20th.” 
The Jackson School of Global Affairs, opening in fall 2022, will be the first new professional school at Yale in over 40 years.
“Encouraging greater research and studies around the impact of AI across all segments of society is one of the greatest investments we could make for our future,” Eric Schmidt wrote. “Wendy and I are confident that The Schmidt Program will foster innovation to uncover the complexities of AI technologies and how they will profoundly transform the way human beings experience the world.”
In March, Eric and Wendy Schmidt donated $150 million to the Broad Institute for advanced biology research using data science and artificial intelligence to battle diseases. On Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan pledged $500 million to Harvard to study natural and artificial intelligence.

Harvard University on Tuesday launched the Kempner Institute for the Study of Natural and Artificial Intelligence, a new University-wide initiative standing at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence, seeking fundamental principles that underlie both human and machine intelligence. The fruits of discoveries will flow in both directions, enhancing understanding of how humans think, perceive the world around them, make decisions, and learn, thereby advancing the rapidly evolving field of AI.
The institute will be funded by a $500 million gift from Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg, which was announced Tuesday by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. The gift will support 10 new faculty appointments, significant new computing infrastructure, and resources to allow students to flow between labs in pursuit of ideas and knowledge. The institute’s name honors Zuckerberg’s mother, Karen Kempner Zuckerberg, and her parents — Zuckerberg’s grandparents — Sidney and Gertrude Kempner. Chan and Zuckerberg have given generously to Harvard in the past, supporting students, faculty, and researchers in a range of areas, including around public service, literacy, and cures.
“The Kempner Institute at Harvard represents a remarkable opportunity to bring together approaches and expertise in biological and cognitive science with machine learning, statistics, and computer science to make real progress in understanding how the human brain works to improve how we address disease, create new therapies, and advance our understanding of the human body and the world more broadly,” said President Larry Bacow.
“Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg have demonstrated a remarkable commitment to promoting discovery, innovation, and service at Harvard and other academic institutions around the United States,” said Bacow. “Their support for the creation of the Kempner Institute will advance Harvard’s education and research mission and is only the most recent way in which they have sought to do so. From supporting the study of COVID-19 treatments and advancing literacy research to boosting public service opportunities for undergraduates, they have shown a genuine commitment through their work at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and beyond to curing disease, improving lives, and encouraging others to serve.”
A focus of the institute will be training future generations of leaders and researchers in this area through funding dedicated to supporting undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral fellows. The institute, expected to open at the new Science and Engineering Complex in Allston by the end of 2022, is committed to the active recruitment of individuals from backgrounds traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields. It will be headed by Bernardo Sabatini, the Alice and Rodman W. Moorhead III Professor of Neurobiology at Harvard Medical School, and Sham Kakade, who in January will become a Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science and Statistics at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and a professor in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. With a faculty steering committee made up of faculty across Schools and disciplines, the institute will convene experts in computer science, applied mathematics, neuroscience, cognitive science, statistics, and engineering.
Sabatini and Kakade, who is coming to Harvard from the University of Washington, spoke with the Gazette about the new effort and the promise and challenge presented by AI and the role it might play in all of our lives. Interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Q&A
Bernardo Sabatini and Sham Kakade

GAZETTE: Tell me about the new institute. What is its main reason for being?
SABATINI: The institute is designed to take from two fields and bring them together, hopefully to create something that’s essentially new, though it’s been tried in a couple of places. Imagine that you have over here cognitive scientists and neurobiologists who study the human brain, including the basic biological mechanisms of intelligence and decision-making. And then over there, you have people from computer science, from mathematics and statistics, who study artificial intelligence systems. Those groups don’t talk to each other very much.
We want to recruit from both populations to fill in the middle and to create a new population, through education, through graduate programs, through funding programs — to grow from academic infancy — those equally versed in neuroscience and in AI systems, who can be leaders for the next generation.
Over the millions of years that vertebrates have been evolving, the human brain has developed specializations that are fundamental for learning and intelligence. We need to know what those are to understand their benefits and to ask whether they can make AI systems better. At the same time, as people who study AI and machine learning (ML) develop mathematical theories as to how those systems work and can say that a network of the following structure with the following properties learns by calculating the following function, then we can take those theories and ask, “Is that actually how the human brain works?”
KAKADE: There’s a question of why now? In the technological space, the advancements are remarkable even to me, as a researcher who knows how these things are being made. I think there’s a long way to go, but many of us feel that this is the right time to study intelligence more broadly. You might also ask: Why is this mission unique and why is this institute different from what’s being done in academia and in industry? Academia is good at putting out ideas. Industry is good at turning ideas into reality. We’re in a bit of a sweet spot. We have the scale to study approaches at a very different level: It’s not going to be just individual labs pursuing their own ideas. We may not be as big as the biggest companies, but we can work on the types of problems that they work on, such as having the compute resources to work on large language models. Industry has exciting research, but the spectrum of ideas produced is very different, because they have different objectives.
GAZETTE: Is it by default going to be human intelligence that you’re studying, as opposed to some other animal intelligence?
SABATINI: Clearly one is interested in understanding human intelligence because it’s the most impressive among animals, but we will draw from the studies of any organism to gain insights into how intelligence works. The institute itself is going to be all dry lab, purely computational, but we will happily take data from animal studies. We will also have a collaborative grant program to seed directed studies and fund groups that we think will generate data crucial to understanding intelligence.
GAZETTE: You mention large-scale computing. Will that hardware require new systems being installed? Or are you going to use the existing infrastructure?
SABATINI: We’re going to buy a lot of GPUs [graphics processing units, that, like CPUs, power many computers] and also make use of cloud computing services.
GAZETTE: What about the institute’s faculty, both new and those already at Harvard working on these questions?
SABATINI: There’s great expertise already at Harvard, and one goal is to bring that expertise together. Basically, we want this institute to be a destination: If you care about intelligence, whether it’s natural or artificial, you should want to come to this institute. That will draw from Harvard and across the world. We have new faculty coming to Harvard who will be explicitly in this domain, who will then help recruit graduate students. We’re going to have professional engineering support on staff to help people translate ideas into code and into deployable solutions. There will also be a very impressive computational back end — hardware to be able to do sophisticated models in a way that is not common in academia. We will have programs by which people already at Harvard can have access to the compute structure and be involved in teaching and recruiting students, and our resources will be available to collaborative Harvard graduate programs, and so forth. We want the community to be as big as possible.
KAKADE: The institute has a pretty unique mission and a unique plan for how we’ll go about things, particularly for academia. Plenty of schools can hire more faculty, but here they’ll be able to do interdisciplinary work and have the resources — support for students, postdocs, engineers, and large-scale computing — to facilitate the program. This is hard to do in academia because we’re limited by grants, and it’s very hard to get sufficient computing resources.
GAZETTE: Why are the resources behind this gift so important?
KAKADE: A unique aspect of the institute is its scale. That allows us to address a number of factors: research, education, and computing. The educational side is not just graduate students; it’s postdocs down to undergraduates. We’re even thinking about having a post-baccalaureate program. The computing side is also remarkable for an academic institution. These algorithms are very data-hungry, and it’s increasingly becoming the case that only the biggest industrial labs can do such research, even though it’s really important to have academia involved to ask purely scientific questions. The institute is set up so that it isn’t just lots of money for computation. It’s engineering support, training people to understand how to build and support ML systems — the gift will greatly expand Harvard’s educational and research capacity in machine learning — and to help with the research pipeline. We will be able to do collaborative, large-scale research like you might at a big company. It will allow us to ask the types of questions that they ask there, but from a very different perspective. This is going to be pretty remarkable.
SABATINI: Some fields are very broad, and if you want to be excellent in that field, you have to be big. For example, my home department at HMS — neurobiology — spans everything from thinking about the structure of an ion channel to processes of cognition. You can’t have a small neurobiology program and be the best. This is a similar field. You need to have a certain mass, a certain breadth, and diversity of people in the institute in order to be on top. You want the only limitation to be ideas. If somebody has a brilliant idea, you want the infrastructure in place, the resources in place such that that idea can be translated into something real as quickly as possible. That requires scale, computing hardware, engineers, project management — all this is going to be essential in moving from idea to reality. The challenge is to build a research resource-deployment structure and a community structure: a place where everybody’s welcome, there are diverse backgrounds, and where we can be proactive in creating a diverse workplace and next generation. It also has to be a place where anyone can have an idea and receive positive reinforcement that helps it become reality.
GAZETTE: When we look ahead to the potential impact of those ideas, what areas of society are most ripe for the introduction of AI?
KAKADE: To a large extent, what’s been happening is that computers are getting better at the types of things people are good at, and we’re seeing tremendous impact across the board. Obviously, we’re seeing a lot of impact with regard to search, and speech recognition really helps people when they’re mobile and can ask questions about what’s near them. Information-gathering, information-processing with robotics is improving. Also, computer vision systems — on cars for example — are improving across the board. The excitement though, is about the potential to have a higher impact in the future. It’s also important that we’re aware of the pitfalls as our systems are improving. The institute’s focus will not be on directly deploying new technologies. Instead, the broader goal of the institute is discovering and increasing scientific knowledge, which we will pursue within ethical frameworks and with a desire to improve the world. Our work will help others advance a field that takes seriously the ethical concerns that have been raised by those both within and outside the field. Here, we will connect with relevant scholars and policymakers, both at Harvard and beyond, because these issues need to be considered in a broader context.
GAZETTE: When you say that excitement is building for a higher impact, are there particular areas people are most excited about?
KAKADE: Obviously, robotics and self-driving cars are moving rapidly. And natural-language processing is big, because the ability of automated systems to be able to generate text that resembles what a human might say is huge. If we can just improve question-answering, for example, that would be pretty incredible. You could ask things and receive answers in a reasonable manner. It’s obviously not all the way there yet, but the fact that language models are not completely gibberish and sometimes produce rich human language is pretty stunning.
GAZETTE: You’re talking about things like Siri, where you can ask a question and it’ll respond without a human being involved at all?
KAKADE: Siri is speech to text, but you can think as well of typing in questions on search and rather than getting back a website, you get the actual information, the answer you’re looking for. There is a growing interconnectedness for how we communicate with devices — Alexa, Siri, for example. Part of the excitement with the field’s progress in natural language models is the ability to have richer interactions both to communicate with each other, to obtain knowledge-based information, and for better interactions with voice-activated devices. That’s pretty exciting. There’s also an improving ability of automated systems to sense their environment, which is huge for smart homes and automated systems. Other areas are progressing also due to the ability of cameras to parse the visual world better, as in medical domains. The last couple of years have been remarkable for scene parsing: You take a picture, and it can understand the various objects in the picture and the relationships among them. More generally, the institute’s broader scientific and technological goals are to facilitate the development of methodologies that permit systems to interact with an environment the way a person might.
SABATINI: It’s important to note that the institute is not only about applications and advancing AI; there’s a fundamental part that is simply about discovering and increasing knowledge. Part of that discovery will be creating computational theories that can explain how our brains work. Once we understand how the brain “computes” and processes information, scientists will be able to eventually understand how those processes go wrong in disease. To do this we will draw from the computational theories that are being developed for understanding how AI works.
Second, any time an artificially intelligent agent has to interact with a human, it would be valuable for that agent to know something about the physical world and to have some common sense. We have common sense, and we expect AI to have common sense, but in general, it doesn’t. So I think that’s going to be a great advance.
Third are problems that we’re not even sure can be addressed. If we could create AI systems that are much larger and have, for example, access to all medical knowledge or all the structures of proteins, what kinds of new discoveries and intelligent conclusions could it make? Those discoveries could come at the level of understanding disease, discovering new therapies, or simply contributing to knowledge about how the world works. I don’t think we can dream of what those things are yet.

BOT or NOT? This special series explores the evolving relationship between humans and machines, examining the ways that robots, artificial intelligence and automation are impacting our work and lives.

Can artificial intelligence write its own programs? Is there AI in your TV remote control? Researchers at Seattle’s Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence say that knowing the right answers to such questions is an essential part of being literate in our tech-driven society — and that most of us would get a failing grade.
A national survey, involving 1,547 adult Americans who were given a 20-question quiz about AI’s capabilities, found that only 16% of the test takers scored a passing grade of better than 60% on the quiz.
“The majority of Americans are AI illiterate,” Nicole DeCario and Oren Etzioni report today in a posting to PNW.ai, an information service provided by the institute, also known as AI2. Etzioni is AI2’s CEO, while DeCario leads AI2’s special projects team.
What’s your AI IQ? Take AI2’s literacy quiz
The researchers acknowledge that the extent of AI illiteracy shouldn’t be surprising. “AI is not part of our schools’ curricula, and the main source of information about it today, according to our survey, is YouTube and social media,” they write.
However, they argue that a basic understanding of how artificial intelligence works is “critical for informing everyday decisions, adopting appropriate economic policies and maintaining national security.”
This doesn’t mean everybody has to be a coder. Rather, basic literacy efforts should familiarize people with what AI tools can do, and what they can’t do. DeCario and Etzioni compare the need for AI literacy standards in the 21st century to the need for the basics of reading, writing and arithmetic in the 19th century.
“To compete in this digital world, we must educate them on computer power, potential and limitations while encouraging an intentional focus on ethics to ensure continued tech advancement is grounded in values we hold dear,” they write.
So what’s the prescription? DeCario and Etzioni recommend adding the basic principles of AI and digital ethics to school curricula, beginning in middle school and building up to high-school coursework. As an example, they point to Colby College’s $30 million initiative to establish a cross-disciplinary institute focusing on AI.
“We need a systematic way to distribute information at scale,” the researchers write. “To that end, we ask that the Biden administration include the development of an AI literacy standard as part of the National AI Initiative within the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. We also call on companies big and small to better educate their employees and consumers about the true capabilities and limits of AI.”
The AI2 duo acknowledge that a lot of questions would need to be addressed. For example, who’d create the standard, and who’d update it to reflect fast-moving progress in the AI field? How do you ensure that people have equal access to information, and an equal voice in the resulting debates?
So here’s a 21st question for the quiz: Could AI help us get a better handle on AI?
Update for 6 p.m. PT Dec. 8: In response to my inquiry, DeCario provided additional perspective on the question of AI curriculum:
“Because education is primarily a state and local responsibility, there is no national standard. So yes, some people are learning about AI in the classroom and others are not. Also, mentioning AI in a classroom vs. learning fundamentals is an important distinction. Computer science courses are generally elective, so adding it to that curriculum alone will not have broad enough reach. Math, science, and social studies all naturally intersect, and each subject can be a home for AI courses. Teaching resources on AI exist for each of these areas.”
AI2’s survey was conducted online in partnership with Echelon Insights from July 13 to 15. The survey sample reflected population targets from the American Community Survey for gender, age, race/ethnicity, education and region.

The algorithm detected a blog post about its own methods, attempting to discredit them.“It’s quite funny. It was kind of a bit of a meta moment,” said Cook, a research fellow at the Climate Change Communication Research Hub at Monash University in Australia.Story continues below advertisementThe team programmed the artificial intelligence to detect false claims in five categories: global warming is not happening; human generated greenhouse gases are not causing global warming; climate impacts are not bad; climate solutions will not work; and climate science and scientists are unreliable.AdvertisementCook said the machine detected at least half a dozen claims about itself in the blog post.🌸Follow D.C. regionFollow“Ultimately, our goal is the Holy Grail of fact-checking, which is being able to detect and debunk misinformation in real time,” said Cook, who partly developed the framework previously at George Mason University. “Ideally, I would have social media platforms using it to detect misinformation in real time.”Such a machine learning algorithm may seem unnecessary to fight climate misinformation as climate change increasingly manifests itself in tangible ways — fire seasons of unprecedented severity, record-breaking heat waves, extremely active hurricane seasons and freak cold snaps.“We now see, for the first time ever, a majority of Americans saying that they think people in the United States are being harmed right now,” said John Kotcher, a professor at the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason who is not affiliated with Cook’s study.The undeniable link between weather disasters and climate changeAccording to surveys conducted in September, Kotcher and his colleagues reported that 55 percent of Americans think climate change is harming people in the United States. Fifty-two percent said they personally experienced the effects of climate change. Previously, most viewed global warming as a psychologically distant threat and far off in the future, affecting penguins and polar bears but not necessarily human health.Now, most are concerned about a range of environmental hazards — among them extreme heat (76 percent are concerned), air pollution (76 percent), droughts (68 percent) and water shortages (64 percent).Yet Kotcher said the public is divided on whether the issue should be a priority for the president and Congress.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“There’s been huge increases among Democrats, both liberal and moderate ones, over the last few years,” said Kotcher, who also publishes reports investigating climate change along with political ideology. He said there has been a slight increase in support from more moderate Republicans, but trends have essentially flatlined for conservative Republicans, who constitute a relatively larger proportion of the GOP.Floods, flames and heat: Images of this year’s extreme weatherAnd Kotcher said it is safe to say climate misinformation is playing a part in the differences of opinion. But not all climate misinformation is the same or is disseminated in the same quantity, the recent study showed.Using the machine-learning algorithm, Cook and his colleagues conducted the largest content analysis of climate contrarian claims to date. The team analyzed more than 250,000 documents from 1998 to 2020 from 20 highly visited, mostly U.S.-based conservative think tanks and 33 central contrarian blogs — outlets the study called “key cogs in the so-called climate change ‘denial machine.’ ”The team found that in recent years, contrarian outlets mainly countered climate information pertaining to science/scientists and solutions.For instance, some may say the science is unreliable and there is no consensus, even though 99.9 percent of scientists agree that human activity is altering our climate. Others may say the movement is unreliable — environmentalists and media are alarmists; and climate scientists are biased, incompetent or lying. For solutions, common claims were that climate policies are harmful and clean energy won’t work.18 weather disasters costing at least $1 billion each have hit the U.S. this yearThe results were surprising to Cook, who has spent the past 15 years addressing science myths — it’s not happening, it’s not us and it’s not real. His previous research focused on how to counter misinformation about the greenhouse effect or the carbon cycle. While those may have been more common targets for contrarian outlets in the early 2000s, the focus has shifted.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“We’re over here fighting this battle and they have already moved over to this other battlefield. And we’re not even there, so that’s a real problem,” said Cook. “There is a dearth of research into understanding attacks on climate science and scientists themselves, let alone developing solutions.”Other researchers have investigated ways to connect better with more conservative audiences. A study published in June showed Republicans in two congressional districts in Missouri and Georgia shifted their views after watching videos on the topic produced by people with similar conservative moral values. The study said the campaign increased the “understanding of the existence, causes and harms of climate change by several percentage points.”Last year, Cook released a free game for phones and computers called “Cranky Uncle,” which allows users to play a humorous game where they must spot logical fallacies in scientific statements. He said lessons learned from the game could help address arguments against attacks on climate scientists, science and solutions.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementHe is also working on integrating the machine-learning algorithm into a browser extension, initially conceived by his students, that could detect misinformation and annotate a webpage in real time.“Climate is such a holistic issue. It affects every aspect of our lives, so we don’t have to go down the science route. I don’t think that’s necessarily going to be the most effective way to … get people caring about the issue,” said Cook. “There is no one magic bullet, and I think we need to pursue multiple avenues from multiple messages to multiple audiences.”Share55 CommentsNewsletterWeekdaysPost LocalThe news you need about the place you call home.

Chan Zuckerberg Initiative co-founders and co-CEOs Mark Zuckerberg ’06, L.L.D. ’17 and Priscilla Chan ’07, announced today a gift to establish the Kempner Institute for the Study of Natural and Artificial Intelligence at Harvard. The new institute, which will have dedicated space in the recently completed Science and Engineering Complex in Allston (see “A 500-Year Building”), is named after Karen Kempner Zuckerberg, the mother of the Meta CEO and founder (Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp are Meta Platforms Inc.’s best-known apps) and her parents. According to Jeff MacGregor, vice president of science communications for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), the Kempner Institute will receive $500 million in funding during the next 15 years. The gift will support 10 new faculty appointments, new computing infrastructure, and resources for students—from undergraduates to post-doctoral fellows—that will allow them to pursue knowledge in an uninhibited way across labs and disciplines. Zuckerberg and Chan, a pediatrician, will donate an additional $2.9 billion to support biomedical research focused on improving human health, with the aim of ultimately ending all human disease. The couple, who met as Harvard undergraduates, pledged 99 percent of their Facebook equity to the initiative in 2015, when their first daughter was born, and launched their science program to end human disease the following year.At Harvard, the Kempner Institute will be co-led by McKay professor of computer science Sham Kakade, of the University of Washington, who will join the Harvard faculty in January 2022, according to an October 20 announcement from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS); and by Harvard Medical School’s Moorhead professor of neurobiology Bernardo Sabatini. He has been a member of the medical school faculty since 2001, and became a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator in 2008. The co-directors’ research thus melds the twin emphases of the institute’s mission, to seek fundamental principles that underlie both human and machine intelligence.Kakade’s work explores the mathematical foundations of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). He is best known for helping create the foundational statistical framework for reinforcement learning, one of three basic machine-learning paradigms (the other two are supervised learning, which requires human intervention to create labeled datasets, and unsupervised learning, in which an algorithm uncovers patterns on its own). In reinforcement learning, the system adapts its behavior responsively to maximize a particular signal from its environment. According to the announcement released by SEAS when Kakade was hired, “His work spans economics, neuroscience, and applied and theoretical machine learning.” Kakade, who received his Ph.D. at the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, University College London, and his B.S. in physics at Caltech, is currently a professor of computer science and statistics at the University of Washington and Senior Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research.Sabatini is a well-known developmental neurobiologist whose laboratory studies the mechanisms underlying synapse and circuit plasticity in living brains, an attribute that permits new behaviors to be learned and refined. His research group also studies how perturbations of normal synaptic function contribute to human neuropsychiatric disorders such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases. Zuckerberg and Chan have a long history of philanthropy in education and health, and neurodegenerative disease has been a focus of their giving. They initially made large donations aimed at improving education in Newark, New Jersey, and in the San Francisco region, and to a local hospital and community foundation where they live in California. In 2015, they founded the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), a limited liability company that allows them to make grants, invest, and engage in political advocacy in a way that a traditional charitable foundation could not. With this latest announcement they extend through 2031 their financial support of the CZ Biohub, a biomedical research collaboration involving Stanford, UCSF, and U.C. Berkeley, founded in 2016 with an initial gift of $600 million. They also announced plans to replicate this Biohub model elsewhere, by funding collaborative research into grand scientific challenges on 15-year time horizons, and to support creation of an interdisciplinary advanced biomedical imaging institute that will unlock “the ability to directly observe and analyze any biological process across spatial scales, in real time, throughout the human body,” said CZI science imaging program officer Stephani Otte.Harvard president Lawrence S. Bacow said “Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg have demonstrated a remarkable commitment to promoting discovery, innovation, and service at Harvard and other academic institutions around the United States. Their support for the creation of the Kempner Institute will advance Harvard’s education and research mission and is only the most recent way in which they have sought to do so. From supporting the study of COVID-19 treatments and advancing literacy research, to boosting public service opportunities for undergraduates, they have shown a genuine commitment through their work at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and beyond to curing disease, improving lives, and encouraging others to serve.”The premise of the Kempner Institute, according to a CZI statement, is that natural and artificial intelligence are “intimately interconnected:the next generation of artificial intelligence requires using principles that our brains use for fast, flexible natural reasoning, and understanding how our brains compute and reason requires theories developed for AI. The Kempner Institute will study AI systems, including artificial neural networks, to develop both principled theories and a practical understanding of how they operate and learn, and it will also focus on research topics that include learning and memory, perception and sensation, brain function, and meta plasticity.The Institute will recruit and train future generations of researchers from undergraduates and graduate students to post-docs and faculty—actively recruiting from underrepresented groups at every stage of the pipeline—to study intelligence from biological, cognitive, engineering, and computational perspectives.”Institute co-director Sabatini said in a statement that understanding of the complex neuronal networks of human brains is expanding rapidly, given new technologies and methodologies. “This new program will bring the fields together by, for example, borrowing features from biological brains to make smarter AI and using computational theories from AI to explain how our brains work.”Kempner Institute Co-Directors Sham Kakade and Bernado SabatiniPhotograph of Sham Kakade courtesy of Sham Kakade; photograph of Bernado Sabatini by Kris Snibbe / Harvard Public Affairs and CommunicationsIn an interview, Sabatini and Kakade said that their first priority will be to assemble an ecosystem of scientists and scholars, and then to define 10 grand challenges in the field of intelligence. Among the kinds of questions that might be pursued, explained Sabatini, is what happens when an artificial neural network is endowed with features from the human brain such as a diversity of cell types, or with the type of neurons that researchers believe perform computation? Working the other direction, do theories about computation in artificial neural networks apply to biological intelligence?

Human intelligence already encompasses the three principal machine learning paradigms—supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning—Kakade and Sabatini pointed out. “Clearly, learning which foods you like and dislike is a process akin to reinforcement learning,” Sabatini elaborated, “but learning to walk is largely an unsupervised project. A baby will try to get up on its feet and stumble…but ultimately learn how to do that on its own.” Learning a language—language is a particular interest of Kakade’s—has components of both supervised and unsupervised learning, as when a baby practices on its own.There is a modularity to human natural intelligence, said Kakade. Each approach has evolved to become optimal for certain types of problems. But as Sabatini pointed out, “We don’t yet really understand why—and how to use that information.”Bacow said that the Kempner Institute represents “a remarkable opportunity to bring together approaches and expertise in biological and cognitive science with machine learning, statistics, and computer science to make real progress in understanding how the human brain works to improve how we address disease, create new therapies, and advance our understanding of the human body and the world more broadly.”To put the Kempner Institute into some perspective, the prorated funding—$33 million annually for 15 years—represents more than 10 percent of the total nonfederal sponsored research support (about $300 million in fiscal year 2021, including both direct research spending and coverage of indirect expenses) the University now receives each year.Read the full CZI announcement here.

How Pixray Uses Artificial Intelligence to Make Drawing Art Easier







Zia Muhammad


12/07/2021 11:00:00 PM









Technology has changed numerous aspects of the manner in which you have currently chosen to end up living your life, but one of the biggest impacts that it has had has to do with the world of art. Drawing something used to require a fair amount of skill, but the advancement of neural networks and the like has given rise to new art forms that don’t require any actual physical drawing or painting skills although they are equally as demanding from a creative point of view.With all of that having been said and now out of the way, it is important to note that one of the most revolutionary technologies that lots of people are talking about in this regard is Pixray. This is a website that makes it so that you can draw virtually anything you want as long as you input it correctly. The way this works is that the website uses AI to use your input and turn it into a visual work of art that might change how we make art in the first place. Previously, a lot of work was being done to make AI better at recognizing faces. That got to the point where AI could be used to create brand new faces that no one has ever seen before with all things having been considered and taken into account. However, the thing that sets Pixray apart is the fact that it goes beyond that by allowing you to input any and all text you choose and use the AI to create an image the accurately corresponds to that text.  I'm still playing with https://t.co/21yclcWULf - this time it's ""An elf carrying a longbow in a forest."" And...not bad. #pixelart pic.twitter.com/jUDMV8LrDu— Sarah Jamila Stevenson (@aquafortis) November 29, 2021  ""the urban tower of Babel"" created with @pixray. #aiart #generativeart pic.twitter.com/QMKYEpKYAq— Tony ""tshirtist in chief"" Tribby 🇺🇸 (@tonytribby) December 3, 2021  I asked @pixray to give me Robots fighting ninjas in the snow.So it did. pic.twitter.com/rZ750apYim— Lachlan Blackmore (@soupness) December 1, 2021 This is revolutionary because of the fact that this is the sort of thing that could potentially end up allowing us to create whatever we desire by just typing in some words. Pixray’s usage of the Clips model released by OpenAI not too long ago is both clever and useful, and it can be especially pertinent in areas where models need to be created. For example, a real estate developer could potentially use this AI to create a visual representation of something they want to build at some point. Artists could also use this as a starting point to develop newer and better ways of expressing themselves which might bring about a brand new cultural revolution if you think about how it can benefit such individuals from a lot of points of view.Read next: Study Reveals That Half Of All Employers Implementing AI Have Found The Technology To Be Beneficial To The Overall Business

UC Riverside is the lead institution of a grant from the Department of Energy, or DOE, to use machine learning techniques to optimize the design of the ATHENA detector, one of the proposed experiments for the future Electron-Ion Collider, or EIC. The research team, which includes members from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, was awarded a total of $980,000.

The EIC is a major new nuclear physics research facility that will be constructed at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, NY. It will explore mysteries of the “strong force” that binds the atomic nucleus together.
The $280,000 grant to UCR is for two years. It will allow Miguel Arratia and Kenneth Barish to contribute to the team’s goal of co-optimizing software and hardware, which would help achieve “co-design,” a known concept in computing and machine learning research but new to nuclear physics.
“The EIC represents a flagship project for the future of nuclear physics, providing an unprecedented opportunity to deploy artificial intelligence techniques in the design stage of large-scale experiments,” said Arratia, an assistant professor of physics and astronomy and the grant’s principal investigator, or PI. “Moreover, we will deliver a framework that will be applicable for the design of any experiments that rely on a simulation package called Geant4, which constitutes the backbone for detector designs in particle and nuclear physics, medical physics, and space science.”
The grant, which will partially support graduate students and a postdoctoral fellow, will allow for a close collaboration with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

“Our students will spend a significant portion of their time there, working with lab physics and computing science experts, and learning about their high-performance computing infrastructure,” said Barish, a professor of physics and astronomy and the grant’s co-PI. “The students will also gain exposure to the artificial intelligence work developed in this project as well as other applications in nuclear physics.”
Design driven by artificial intelligence, or AI, is an emerging field for the EIC. 
“Our goal is to shape the EIC to become the first ‘AI-driven collider’ with the first ‘AI-driven experiments’,” Arratia said. 
Arratia won the competition to name the ATHENA detector. His student, Sean Preins, won the competition for the collaborations logo after a vote.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Project Management applications are fine for specific use within narrow parameters. When it's time to expand, it's time to look at a Work OS.




Businesses are becoming increasingly fractured. As more companies embrace remote work and highly specialized departments, many find it difficult to keep everyone on the same page. In the past few years, a growing number of businesses have turned to project management (PM) software for help.
While PM software is gaining popularity, its adoption remains relatively limited. A survey published in 2020 found that just 23% of global organizations use these tools. Part of this is because they’re still relatively new, but many users also find that they don’t meet their needs.
If you’re considering PM tools to help your growing organization, you should know that there’s another option. Work operating systems like monday.com have emerged as a more helpful alternative. (Read also: How to Ensure Peak Remote Work Activity.)
How Is a Work OS Different from Project Management Software?
PM tools are programs that help plan, schedule and allocate resources to a specific project. Different solutions offer varying features, but the primary purpose of all of them is to facilitate easier project planning and tracking. For example, a team developing a new product could use it to set a timeline, estimate a budget, then assign tasks like market research to different employees.
A Work OS is similar but offers a more comprehensive approach. In a Work OS, team members can build custom tools and workflows, enabling more freedom and customization to meet their unique needs. Some more sophisticated options like monday.com also feature low-code or no-code app creation and built-in communication channels.
Work OS solutions still have many of the same project organization features but also support a company’s other operations, including day-to-day work and communication. They typically include automation features, data and app integrations, data gathering, visualization and analytics, and adjustable permissions.Advertisements




Where Project Management Software Falls Short
At first, PM software may seem sufficient for your operations. These tools can enable significant productivity and transparency gains, especially compared to older, paper-and-pencil alternatives. Still, despite its benefits, PM software often falls short in a few areas.
According to a survey performed by Capterra, nearly 60% of project teams are cross-functional, but PM tools are often specialized, narrow-scoped services. This makes communicating and working across departments challenging, often requiring teams to use multiple other apps. Since, (as reported in the survey) 38% of PM users report difficulty integrating it with other systems, this often creates disorganization and disruption.
The most oft-cited issue with PM software is its complexity, with 43% of users saying it has a steep learning curve. When you have employees from multiple departments using various systems, it makes it harder to collaborate. If one team can’t tell what another’s workload or processes look like, transitioning between them will likely cause disruption.
How a Work OS Improves Operations
Many of PM software’s most pressing issues come from the same place: it’s too limited. These tools work well for specific projects with small, dedicated teams with clear goals but aren’t sufficient for other operations. Work OS solutions are an ideal alternative here since they’re organization-wide and include multiple integrations by design.
Since every member in an organization would use the same work OS, everyone’s already used to the system. No one would have to learn to use new tools or software to collaborate with other departments. Hosting everyone on the same platform also provides a single source of information, helping different stakeholders stay on the same page. (Read also: Managing Cloud Sprawl in Your Organization.) 
App building and integration are key components of any Work OS, fixing PM software’s interoperability problem. These integrations reduce the amount of separate apps teams will need and eliminate confusion from working in fractured environments.
While 90% of organization leaders say agility is crucial to future success, only 26% say they have high agility. A Work OS’s automation features eliminate many routine tasks, making workflows more agile. As teams collaborate more seamlessly and reduce workflow bottlenecks, they’ll ensure long-term success.
In Practice: Work OS vs. Project Management Software
To help understand these benefits, imagine a software development company was designing a new mobile app. First, designers will need to design and prototype the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX), which often require various tools. In PM software, these solutions may be incompatible, making sharing progress or finished work difficult. A Work OS could integrate with these apps, letting them share their work seamlessly.
After the design phase, this work must change hands for developers to make a working version. A Work OS provides shared calendars and workflows, providing insight into each team and worker’s workload, timeline, and status, which enables more seamless hand-offs. Similarly, automation tools can automatically notify workers of changes or adjust priorities. PM software doesn’t provide this transparency or automation, which could lead to scheduling problems.
During development, workers will likely have to revisit their work frequently to fix bugs. Both PM software and work OSes enable this process to happen smoothly, editing and reassigning tasks as needed. Since Work OS solutions often include built-in communication services, though, they may make it easier to collaborate through this process. Automated alerts for bugs and errors further speed this part of development. (Read also: Diving into Dev: The Software Development Lifecycle.) 
In the last step before launch, the company will need to run some user tests. In a PM solution, this may look like a team receiving the order to test, then running them in other programs. With a Work OS, these testing programs would integrate with the rest of their tools, helping other stakeholders track progress and streamlining workflows.
With this example, it’s clear why companies like Hulu and Uber use work OS solutions for their software development. While PM tools don’t cause any significant disruptions, Work OS enables much smoother, more collaborative workflows. These benefits lead to faster times to market at least and better, more polished end products at best.
It’s Time to Switch to a Work OS
The need for collaboration is becoming increasingly clear today, yet remote work and all-digital workplaces can make collaboration challenging. Work OS platforms like monday.com give teams the transparency, interoperability and flexibility they need to work together in these fractured environments.
Project management software can be helpful, but these solutions are often too limited. You need more than a way to manage and organize individual projects. Work OS is the answer.

People are using machines to automate more and more of the tasks they don't want to do. For example, we all know machines are responsible for sending out thank you emails or helping organize your search engine results. But some of the more complex jobs are being phased out with the introduction of AI (artificial intelligence) as well. Some creative platforms are even working on AI to suggest relevant logo ideas for a faster and cheaper design process..While the world of robots will leave some feeling nervous or skeptical, we see automation often simplifies small tasks and makes more room for addressing complexities. For example, a business owner can use AI to send emails at the right time, freeing themselves up to do other jobs and improving customer-response time. So in the right setting, AI can be a win-win..This blog will check out the rise of robots in the workforce and how they impact the design industry..Will Robots Take My Job?.With AI on the rise, people are rightfully concerned that their jobs may become obsolete. However, many professionals suggest that machines will only enhance our work—freeing us from busywork and allowing us to focus on the tasks that require more creativity and adaptability..One study suggests nearly half of all workers are at risk of their jobs to robots. However, not all jobs are at risk. Most of the jobs facing a machine takeover are ones that don't require a lot of thought, creativity or human intuition..We have seen cashiers replaced by machine kiosks in places like McDonald's and Costco food courts. This has sped up the checkout process, freeing up workers to focus on fulfilling the orders. Other jobs that AI can replace include telemarketing, bookkeepers, proofreaders, advertising salespeople, marketing research analysts and more..A website called &quot;Will Robots Take My Job&quot; suggests the future automation risk factor when you type in your job. While bankers and tellers face a high (92%) risk, graphic designers are only at a 4% risk of being replaced by machines. However, this doesn't mean AI can't do parts of their job in certain capacities—as we will see below with the logos made by AI..The software developers are working hard to match human creativity, but that is no easy task. Certain aspects of a job can be automated—like putting together elements for a great-looking logo. Some attempts have been made to write articles, advertisements and more. In some cases, it can be very hard to tell a machine's work apart from a human's..AI Logo Design Could be a Thing of the Future.So, what about logo design?.Can machines really produce designs that can keep up with logos from graphic designers?.One studio used AI to create logos for their clients, and no one suspected anything for more than a year. Charging $1,500 per design, the studio gave the AI a common Russian name—Nikolay Ironov—and made him look like a remote worker. Clients could choose an express design program that provided a faster turnaround with no options for revisions or further discussions on the final deliverable. The studio wanted to see how clients would respond without the bias of knowing Nikolay was a machine with a design algorithm..The AI Nikolay created 17 projects and worked with real clients for a year. No one knew they weren't working with a real designer until the firm revealed it. The studio explained, &quot;Nikolay is available 24 hours a day. He does not get sick. He does not experience crippling creative blocks. He is always developing and can complete tasks in a matter of seconds. More importantly, his designs are completely unique.&quot;.This experiment produced a lot of buzz, proving that AI does have a role to play in design. Using that concept, certain software developers and design teams have built platforms offering automated logo design. AI offers a quick and inexpensive solution to their logo design problem for many small companies, startups and businesses with a tight budget..12 Logo Designs Created by Machines.Still not sure if you would trust a robot to make your logo? While you may have to watch for generic outcomes, a logo maker can offer thousands of fonts, illustrations and color combinations to help the logo be unique. Here are 12 logos designed with AI tools..Logos created by Tailor Brands.Each of these logos from Tailor Brands offers a unique font and design element to help draw the eye to the element. While Boho Bird may be perfect for a designer or clothing brand, Emma' logo is geared towards a much younger audience. The Balance logo offers a stylized illustration that helps clarify they are a yoga/fitness studio, while Bones.ai ties together the gear with the &quot;ai&quot; by utilizing the pop of radioactive green for a modern tech look..Logos created by Brandmark.Brandmark's platform is producing a variety of designs that would serve as viable logos for a real company. The CIELA MONTESSORI logo shows the concept of growth with the tree illustration and creativity with the pretty turquoise logotype. COCO is creative in its letter replacement, giving a very clear visual of their product. Darnel's is a simple approach to a logo that is perfect for the fuss-free to-go cafe. GOOMOE could easily be an audio or tech company logo with one of the letters simply representing movement with the use of lines..Logos created by Designs.ai.The illustrations by Designs.ai are friendly and diverse. Blossom the Flower Shop logo uses an elegant flower illustration to catch the eye and clarify the shop's intent before the viewer has even finished reading the logo. B.LIVE uses a very stylized honeycomb bee to give the company a modern feel, while Noodle has a fun illustration with a bright color use that suggests the place is family-oriented. Sweet factory is certainly a logo for audiences of all ages and offers a clear picture of their promised products..Creating Your Designs with AI.There is a lot of potential in machine-created logo design. Many of these options save thousands of hours and dollars for brands looking for a simplified process. It may seem surprising that robots can produce fun, quirky, professional and unique logo designs, but the proof is in the pudding..AI is here to stay, and brands should take advantage of it. We can stay ahead of the game by looking for ways to use AI to help improve jobs..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
