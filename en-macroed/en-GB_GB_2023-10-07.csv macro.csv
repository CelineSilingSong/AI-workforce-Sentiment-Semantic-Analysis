Still, it’s difficult to realize the full potential of these tools without clear purpose. Adopting technology just for technology’s sake carries inherent risks: new technology plus an outdated process will only equal an expensive old process, creating a subpar experience for employees and customers. The more sustainable value of technology adoption doesn’t come from what the technology does, but what the user can do with it.
 
With this in mind, we can plot the potential impact of generative AI in two powerful categories of use cases: AI collaboration and talent and governance strategy.
 
AI collaboration
 
Organizations will have to assess how AI could influence both back-office functions, and customer-facing work. For example, AI might be thought of as an added digital assistant taking on bulk analytical or technical tasks in a first instance. Employees could utilize their AI tools for mundane or repetitive tasks. The Digital Worker Experience Survey from Gartner found that 47% of digital workers struggle to find the information or data needed to effectively perform their jobs, presenting an opportunity for AI-powered tools and collaborative technologies to increase efficiency.
 
More wide-reaching for internal use is generative AI’s influence across business functions, like HR and  Payroll (via ey.com US). AI tools can perform rolling analysis on performance indicators of employees and recommend training and upskilling opportunities. Through individualized credentials and authentication, AI tools can give different levels of information appropriate to the seniority and job title of the requestor. These digital tasks can run independently, around the clock, allowing for reports or red flags to be delivered constantly. This is more robust than traditional automation because these new tools have deeper context and generative abilities.
 
Talent and governance
 
Generative AI’s ability to identify training opportunities for employees can also contribute to an overall assessment of the skills organizations have now and will need in the future. The ability to customize these technologies can enable new ways to create a career development track attuned to employee experience and business need.
 
Importantly, the enterprise-level implementation of generative AI with large data sets and confidential materials can help ease compliance exercises, while also creating areas for potential risk. These AI tools built for purpose can automate the gathering, cleansing and interpretation of data, while summarizing findings and offering recommendations from it. These tasks need to be done within the context of an organization’s ethical AI governance framework, maintaining guardrails that are appropriate for an organization’s particular needs. Generative AI outputs should be seen as first drafts, with people making adjustments and final assessments of the work.
 
But appropriate guidelines can make that first draft even better.
 
For business functions requiring bulk retention of certain types of data to maintain regulatory compliance, or more stringent privacy controls, generative AI tools need to follow clearly defined and transparent access and retention policies and have processes in place to monitor for potential legal risks around the use or leveraging of intellectual property.
 
This need extends to AI-enabled HR tools to assess opportunities for improvements to internal communication, process change or technology investments, or other unseen challenges. By mixing quantitative and qualitative assessments of the workforce, both with AI tools and apart from them, leaders can better understand the state of organizational culture and capabilities. Industrializing the analysis of multiple data sources may help identify bright spots or hotspots related to employee retention, and quickly, deeply and consistently respond to and anticipate opportunities.
 
Similarly, this assessment can flag potential compliance or regulatory risks in real time. But the effectiveness and reliability of this activity relies on an appropriate ethical generative AI framework and governance model, including countering potential bias transmitted through public training data, and avoiding the recycling of toxicity received in certain inputs.   
 
Even with the need for regular management and maintenance of generative AI tools, these systems can provide better visibility on how an organization is operating and organizing itself for the “next normal” of work.

So how can legal professionals build trust in AI? ",N/A,http://schema.org,Organization,Thomson Reuters Legal,,,N/A,N/A,"  Artificial IntelligenceEstablishing trust in generative AI October 9, 2023 · 5 minute read  Share   Facebook   Twitter   Linkedin   Email  October 9, 2023 · 5 minute read  Share   Facebook   Twitter   Linkedin   Email OpenAI’s ChatGPT prototype opened a world of possibilities to generative artificial intelligence (AI), and the technology continues to revolutionize the way we live and work. As its role in our daily lives continues to expand, many lawyers and legal industry experts are beginning to recognize what these tools could mean for the profession. In a recent survey of lawyers conducted by the Thomson Reuters Institute, 82% of legal professionals said they believe that generative AI such as ChatGPT can be applied to legal work, with 59% of partners and managing partners sharing generative AI should be applied to legal work. Despite this large majority, organizations are still taking a cautiously proactive approach. 62% of respondents shared their concerns with the use of ChatGPT and generative AI at work, and all who were surveyed noted that they do not fully trust generative AI tools like ChatGPT with confidential client data.  The introduction of any new technology comes with understandable hesitancy, but these key findings show one thing for certain: establishing trust in AI is essential. So how can legal professionals build trust in AI?  Trust in AI starts with transparencyAs explained in our companion article about the current state of AI, transparency in relation to AI means that stakeholders — including developers, users, and legal practitioners — should feel confident in the quality of the data that AI models use and how they make decisions. They should also be prepared to test AI outputs against their own knowledge and expertise in early implementations of those outputs.  Furthermore, transparency gives confidence that ethical principles are being followed throughout the development and deployment of a generative AI system to avoid bias. This includes confirming that data used for training models is collected responsibly and without prejudice toward particular groups or individuals.   Legal work and AI transparency The greatest and most fundamental trust generator is accuracy. Keep in mind that generative AI tools may not always produce correct results and that human oversight is still necessary. Therefore, lawyers should always review any documentation provided by an AI system to ensure that it meets standards for accuracy, explainability, and security. Using generative AI with confidential client data also means firms must establish proper governance structures, including strong security measures such as:Encryption and authentication protocolsRobust policies about ethical usageRegular auditing and testingStrong content filtration systemsHuman in the loop (HITL): always submit large language model (LLM) outputs to human review (at least during the initial phase of working with LLM)Knowing your user (for traceability)Educating employees about the promise of LLM and its limitationsAppropriating personnel trained on best practices for using the technology securely and responsibly Having these measures in place will help ensure that any risks are minimized while maximizing generative AI’s potential benefits. One consideration to take is adopting a “fail safe” system where any discrepancies or errors flagged by the AI tool are automatically escalated for manual review by a lawyer or other qualified personnel. This way, inaccurate decisions can be corrected quickly and confidently in a way that benefits both clients and organizations alike.  It is clear that generative AI is poised to revolutionize the way the legal industry practices law, and it is here to stay. But with this emerging technology comes a crucial need for trust — giving lawyers the confidence that they are able to protect client interests while learning to do better work with an innovative solution. What you should know before investing in an AI-powered legal tech providerHere are three important criteria for choosing the right AI-powered legal tools.Read blog postVisit our hub on artificial intelligence.  AwfulPoorAverageGoodExcellentRated 4.0 by 4 users.Sending rating...Thank you!

The study, conducted by Censuswide on behalf of Visier - a cloud-based analytics platform designed to assist people and businesses in decision-making - found that UK employees who are already  embracing AI in the workplace  are saving 1.55 hours per day. This amounts to around 390 hours a year. But employees taking advantage of the new technology are far from the majority. Some 56 per cent of employees in the  Visier  study said that their employers are not encouraging the use of AI at work,  and 53 per cent are concerned about AI replacing the skills they currently have and taking away their jobs. The research took in responses from 3,030 people aged 18 and above working at companies with over 250 employees in the UK, Germany US, and Canada between 25 and 31 May.  How do workers feel about working with AI? Despite the time-saving potential of AI, the study shows that workers feel ambivalent about  how the new technology is going to impact their work life.  More than one in three (36 per cent) said that AI will make them more stressed at work, while 37 per cent said they’re concerned that their work will be less accurate because of AI. Some 38 per cent are worried that AI might compromise data privacy. But while they fear the consequences of deploying AI in the workplace, more than two in three (67 per cent) think that developing AI skills is going to be important for their future career growth, showing that they think AI will inevitably be part of their job one day. At the same time, workers do not necessarily think it will be their AI skills that get them a promotion in the future. Some 40 per cent of employees studied by Visier think that soft skills are the most important to support career growth, while 43 per cent believe leadership skills are.  Only 10 per cent of employees thought that hard skills - like mastering the use of emerging technology - was a crucial aspect to get further in their careers. Some 40 per cent think that AI will improve their work-life balance, and 31 per cent think that it will help close the skills gap in the UK workforce. Is AI likely to become part of UK employees’ jobs? The UK is currently in the process of building the regulation of AI in the workplace, after campaigners, trade unions and some members of Parliament called for the government to impose stricter oversight of how the new tech could be used. For years now, the debate around AI in the workplace has been split between pros and cons, and the need to find a balance between the two. “Making work more rewarding, making it more satisfying, and crucially making it safer and fairer: these are all the possibilities that AI offers us,” Mary Towers, an employment lawyer who runs a Trade Union Congress (TUC) project on AI at work, said during a half-day conference about the topic in April. “We’re at a really important juncture, where the technology is developing so rapidly, and what we have to ask ourselves is, what direction do we want that to take, and how can we ensure that everyone’s voice is heard?” A survey published last month by the Prospect trade union showed that almost 60% of British people want regulation of AI in the workplace. “The workplace has been disrupted by rapid innovation and everyone has a role to play in its smooth adoption. With skills gaps widening across the UK, AI can alleviate a wide range of pain points. But, with opportunity comes responsibility,” said Ben Harris, Director UK MD at Visier.  “Business leaders must ensure they are spotting gaps in employee skills, and training them on emerging technologies like, but not limited to, AI. By taking a skills-based view, organisations can rethink roles, and identify skills that can be combined with emerging technologies like AI to future-proof jobs, boost productivity and enhance performance. In a context of skills and labour shortages, combining AI with transferable skills will enable companies to fill gaps easily and stay competitive while minimising redundancies.” ', 'dateCreated': '2023-07-10 15:46:45 +02:00', 'dateModified': '2023-07-10 15:59:15 +02:00', 'datePublished': '2023-07-10 15:59:13 +02:00', 'image': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/07/74/15/26/1440x810_cmsv2_5b595f70-839a-5a19-94a3-1c35799137ea-7741526.jpg', 'width': '1440px', 'height': '810px', 'caption': 'Working with AI could save hundreds of hours of work every year for UK workers -- but many are worried that the new tech will replace their skills.', 'thumbnail': 'https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/07/74/15/26/385x202_cmsv2_5b595f70-839a-5a19-94a3-1c35799137ea-7741526.jpg', 'publisher': {'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'euronews', 'url': 'https://static.euronews.com/website/images/euronews-logo-main-blue-403x60.png'}}, 'author': {'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Giulia Carbonaro', 'url': 'carbonaro', 'sameAs': 'https://twitter.com/carbonaro_giu'}, 'publisher': {'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'Euronews', 'legalName': 'Euronews', 'url': 'https://www.euronews.com/', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://static.euronews.com/website/images/euronews-logo-main-blue-403x60.png', 'width': '403px', 'height': '60px'}, 'sameAs': ['https://www.facebook.com/euronews', 'https://twitter.com/euronews', 'https://flipboard.com/@euronews', 'https://www.instagram.com/euronews.tv/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/euronews']}, 'isAccessibleForFree': 'False', 'hasPart': {'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': 'False', 'cssSelector': '.poool-content'}, 'speakable': {'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'xPath': ['/html/head/title', ""/html/head/meta[@name='description']/@content""], 'url': 'https://www.euronews.com/next/2023/07/10/embracing-ai-could-save-employees-about-390-hours-of-working-time-per-year-uk-study-shows'}}, {'@type': 'WebSite', 'name': 'Euronews.com', 'url': 'https://www.euronews.com/', 'potentialAction': {'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://www.euronews.com/search?query={search_term_string}', 'query-input': 'required name=search_term_string'}, 'sameAs': ['https://www.facebook.com/euronews', 'https://twitter.com/euronews', 'https://flipboard.com/@euronews', 'https://www.instagram.com/euronews.tv/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/euronews']}]","[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Home', 'item': 'https://www.euronews.com/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Next', 'item': 'https://www.euronews.com/next'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Tech&#x20;News', 'item': 'https://www.euronews.com/next/tech-news'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 4, 'name': 'AI models don’t comply with the EU’s AI Act, according to a Stanford study'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To help illustrate the concept, we will draw parallels with the iconic movie, “The Matrix.” And regardless of if you are taking the red pill or the blue pill (watch the movie!), the takeaways for employers are the same:

We have been living with and benefiting from AI for decades. However, generative AI is different, both in what it can do, how it does it, and who can use it.
There are serious concerns about the proliferation of generative AI without proper guardrails in place to harness the technology, especially the potential for bias in recruiting and hiring.

Understanding Generative AI
AI has been subtly influencing our lives for decades. However, generative AI is a different beast altogether. It can generate text, images, video, and audio, and even replicate a human’s voice after just hearing three seconds of audio. In a way, the new technology is analogous to The Matrix; it creates a simulated reality almost indistinguishable from the real world.
The many pros and cons of generative AI in the workplace underscore the need for a balanced approach that respects legal boundaries while harnessing the power of this innovative technology.
The Benefits
Generative AI holds immense potential for both individuals and businesses. In the workplace, this technology can be leveraged to draft more accurate job descriptions, simplify processes, and eliminate repetitive tasks. By handling the preliminary legwork, generative AI allows companies to optimize efficiencies, thereby revolutionizing the hiring process. It is like having your own Agent Smith, the main antagonist of The Matrix franchise, tirelessly working behind the scenes to streamline operations – but, hopefully, without the destruction.
Beyond the workplace, generative AI can solve complex problems, preserve languages on the brink of extinction, and assist visually impaired individuals in understanding their surroundings. It can tailor professional development content to each person’s unique style, needs, and preferences. The potential applications of this technology are vast, promising a future where AI can significantly enhance our capabilities and experiences, much like the limitless potential of The Matrix.
The Risks and Regulations
Despite its potential benefits, generative AI also presents significant risks. It could potentially automate weapons, and quickly identify and exploit security vulnerabilities. It also has a power that is not necessarily controlled by its human creators. This echoes the dystopian future presented in The Matrix, where AI has become an uncontrollable force.
The potential for misuse of generative AI underscores the need for robust regulations. In the context of hiring, for instance, there are concerns about the potential for bias when using generative AI. Recognizing this, New York City recently passed a statute requiring employers to notify candidates if an automated system is being used in the hiring process. The law also mandates that employers provide candidates with an alternative means of being screened and commit to having an external auditor evaluate the tools annually for evidence of bias.
Other states and local jurisdictions across the country have bills in the works and are considering some form of regulation around the use of AI in the hiring process.
The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission also has instructed employers: “Be careful, be conservative. We’re watching that you’re using this. We think that there’s bias here and you shouldn’t be using these tools.”
These developments represent a significant step toward ensuring the responsible use of AI in the workplace. However, as generative AI continues to evolve, so too must our legal frameworks. We need to train the models to continue in the direction that we intend them, and not go down a rabbit hole, and start to do things that are in misalignment from the intended purpose. This is akin to the struggle in The Matrix – to control AI and prevent it from taking over.
Conclusion
Generative AI represents a new frontier in technology, one that holds immense potential but also significant risks. As we continue to explore this brave new world, it is crucial that we strike a balance between harnessing the power of generative AI and ensuring its responsible use. This technology can revolutionize the workplace. However, without proper guardrails and legal frameworks in place, the proliferation of generative AI could lead to unforeseen consequences, much like the dystopian future depicted in The Matrix.AuthorsTracey E.

Published: 10 Oct 2023


 
A factory filled with robot workers once seemed like a scene from a science-fiction movie, but today, it's just one real-life scenario that reflects manufacturers' use of artificial intelligence.







Manufacturers can benefit from AI implementations in several ways. Here are 10 examples of AI use cases in manufacturing that business leaders should explore now and consider in the future.

1. Cobots work with humans
Collaborative robots -- also called cobots -- frequently work alongside human workers, functioning as an extra set of hands.
While autonomous robots are programmed to repeatedly perform one specific task, cobots are capable of learning various tasks. They also can detect and avoid obstacles, and this agility and spatial awareness enables them to work alongside -- and with -- human workers.
Manufacturers typically direct cobots to work on tasks that require heavy lifting or on factory assembly lines. For example, cobots working in automotive factories can lift heavy car parts and hold them in place while human workers secure them. Cobots are also able to locate and retrieve items in large warehouses.

2. RPA tackles tedious tasks
While manufacturing companies use cobots on the front lines of production, robotic process automation (RPA) software is more useful in the back office. RPA software is capable of handling high-volume or repetitious tasks, transferring data across systems, queries, calculations and record maintenance.
RPA software automates functions such as order processing so that people don't need to enter data manually, and in turn, don't need to spend time searching for inputting mistakes. In this way, RPA has the potential to save time and labor.
RPA is also known for being able to handle server issues and downtime. In the event of these types of complications, RPA can reboot and reconfigure servers, ultimately leading to lower IT operational costs.



Manufacturers are increasingly adding AI components into their processes to boost efficiency while lowering costs.







3. Digital twins help boost performance
Companies can use digital twins to better understand the inner workings of complicated machinery.
A digital twin is a virtual model of a physical object that receives information about its physical counterpart through the latter's smart sensors. Using AI and other technologies, the digital twin helps deliver deeper understanding about the object. Companies can monitor an object throughout its lifecycle and get critical notifications, such as alerts for inspection and maintenance.
As an example, sensors attached to an airplane engine will transmit data to that engine's digital twin every time the plane takes off or lands, providing the airline and manufacturer with critical information about the engine's performance. An airline can use this information to conduct simulations and anticipate issues.


4. Predictive maintenance improves safety, lowers costs
Manufacturing plants, railroads and other heavy equipment users are increasingly turning to AI-based predictive maintenance (PdM) to anticipate servicing needs.
If equipment isn't maintained in a timely manner, companies risk losing valuable time and money. On the one hand, they waste money and resources if they perform machine maintenance too early. On the other, waiting too long can cause the machine extensive wear and tear. The latter can also expose workers to safety hazards.
PdM systems can also help companies predict what replacement parts will be needed and when.


5. Lights-out factories save money
An AI in manufacturing use case that's still rare but which has some potential is the lights-out factory. Using AI, robots and other next-generation technologies, a lights-out factory operates on an entirely robotic workforce and is run with minimal human interaction.
Manufacturers can potentially save money with lights-out factories because robotic workers don't have the same needs as their human counterparts. For example, a factory full of robotic workers doesn't require lighting and other environmental controls, such as air conditioning and heating. Manufacturers can economize by adjusting these services.
Robotic workers can operate 24/7 without succumbing to fatigue or illness and have the potential to produce more products than their human counterparts, with potentially fewer mistakes.


6. Machine learning algorithms predict demand
AI systems that use machine learning algorithms can detect buying patterns in human behavior and give insight to manufacturers.
For example, certain machine learning algorithms detect buying patterns that trigger manufacturers to ramp up production on a given item. This ability to predict buying behavior helps ensure that manufacturers are producing high-demand inventory before the stores need it.





7. Inventory management prevents bottlenecks
Some manufacturing companies are relying on AI systems to better manage their inventory needs.
AI systems can keep track of supplies and send alerts when they need to be replenished. Manufacturers can even program AI to identify industry supply chain bottlenecks.
For example, a pharmaceutical company might use an ingredient that has a short shelf life. AI systems can predict whether that ingredient will arrive on time or, if it's running late, how the delay will affect production.


8. AI boosts supply chain management
One strong AI use case in manufacturing is supply chain management. Large manufacturers typically have supply chains with millions of orders, purchases, materials or ingredients to process. Handling these processes manually is a significant drain on people's time and resources, and more companies have begun augmenting their supply chain processes with AI.
For example, a car manufacturer might receive nuts and bolts from two separate suppliers. If one supplier accidentally delivers a faulty batch of nuts and bolts, the car manufacturer will need to know which vehicles were made with those specific nuts and bolts. An AI system can help track which vehicles were made with defective hardware, making it easier for manufacturers to recall them from the dealerships.


9. AI systems detect errors
Manufacturers can use automated visual inspection tools to search for defects on production lines. Visual inspection equipment -- such as machine vision cameras -- is able to detect faults in real time, often more quickly and accurately than the human eye.
For example, visual inspection cameras can easily find a flaw in a small, complex item -- for example, a cellphone. The attached AI system can alert human workers of the flaw before the item winds up in the hands of an unhappy consumer.


10. AI systems help speed product development
Some manufacturers are turning to AI systems to assist in faster product development, as is the case with drug makers.
AI can analyze data from experimentation or manufacturing processes. Manufacturers can use knowledge gained from the data analysis to reduce the time it takes to create pharmaceuticals, lower costs and streamline replication methods.

According to the National Registry of Exonerations, since 1989, the wrongly convicted have lost 29,950 years of their lives thanks to miscarriages of justice in the U.S. legal system.


In an attempt to tackle this, the California Western School of Law established the California Innocence Project, which aims to assist in cases with compelling evidence indicating that people have been locked up unfairly.

This is often highly complex, labor-intensive work requiring many hours of dedication by professional lawyers and researchers. However, an innovative artificial intelligence partnership is helping to hugely speed up the painstaking work, giving hope that it will lead to a reduction in time spent behind bars by innocent people.

In this piece, I’ll take a look at the partnership and the technology behind it, as well as consider the potential impact that generative AI tools can have on the legal profession in general.

What is the California Innocence Project?
The project was founded in 1999 with the aim of freeing the wrongfully convicted, advocating for reform in the justice system and training lawyers and students to deal with miscarriages of justice.

Examples of high-profile wins include the overturning of the conviction of Timothy Atkins, who spent 23 years in prison after being wrongfully imprisoned for a murder carried out during a carjacking, and the conviction of Kimberly Long in 2016 for murdering her boyfriend. In both cases, lawyers working with the project uncovered new evidence that persuaded judges that the convictions were unsafe.

How is the California Innocence Project using Generative AI?
To assist with the time-consuming and highly technical work of reviewing mountains of evidence and case law connected to their investigations, CIP lawyers deployed a generative AI model developed by CaseText in partnership with ChatGPT creators OpenAI.
Billed as an AI legal assistant, the platform – known as CoCounsel, is capable of reviewing and summarizing legal documents, preparing depositions and drafting reports. It's based on a large language model (LLM) of the same type used by the OpenAI’s groundbreaking chatbot but specifically trained on legal documents, case law and court proceedings.
According to CIP attorney Michael Semanchik, the time saved by using the tool for these essential but mundane tasks frees the legal team to spend time on tasks that require human interaction. For example, drafting a letter to send to a client traditionally takes around 15 minutes but can now be achieved in under one minute. Complex documents can be summarized in plain English, reducing the time taken by a human to digest and comprehend them.
Of course, working in such a sensitive field means it’s critical that the AI produces accurate output and isn’t affected by bias, hallucinations and other issues that can affect generative AI.
In order to minimize this risk, CoCounsel was beta-tested by lawyers from 400 firms, including multinational law firms, solo practitioners and Fortune 500 companies. Care is also taken that the sensitive information often entered into the system by those using it isn't stored or fed back into the platform for training to mitigate the risk of “leaking” confidential data.
While it’s too early to measure the precise impact that generative AI will have on the work of the CIP, Semanchik expects that in the future, it will mean they are able to take on more clients and potentially overturn greater numbers of wrongful convictions.
As reported by the California Western School of Law Campus News, he believes “There’s no question it can make for better lawyering. I would argue that in the long-term, failure to embrace and utilize AI may result in a lawyer not being the best and most competent advocate for their client.”
How Will Generative AI Impact Lawyers and the Legal System?
Generative AI has the potential to transform the legal profession by automating many routine and time-consuming tasks, aiding in research and helping lawyers to make better decisions.
As an information-intensive field of work, AI companies have been quick to build and bring products to market.
One leading provider of consumer legal services, LegalZoom, has said that AI will help it to streamline its operations and eliminate inefficiencies in drafting and reviewing contracts.
ThoughtRiver has developed an AI platform designed to automate the process of reviewing contracts and highlighting risks, and Lex Machina offers a product that aims to predict the behavior of courts and judges, forecasting the likely lengthiness of litigation and potential costs and outcomes.
As well as helping lawyers to work more quickly and productively, innovation in this field has the potential to benefit society as a whole by reducing the cost of accessing justice and legal redress.
There are still barriers to be overcome, in particular around data quality and privacy. However, the potential time and money savings will undoubtedly create incentives for these to be tackled. Overall, it's hard to overstate the opportunities that generative AI creates for driving transformative change in the field of law, and it’s an area where I’m confident we’ll see more exciting developments in the future.

The technology is currently on a path that emphasizes automation, the displacement of skilled labor, and diminished worker voice due to stepped-up monitoring and surveillance, according to a new policy memo by MIT professors Daron Acemoglu, David Autor, and Simon Johnson.
But the nature of generative AI’s impact is not an inevitable consequence of the technology itself, the authors write. Rather, it depends on how society develops and shapes AI.
The following summary outlines the automation path of generative AI and suggests five policies that could steer AI development and implementation in a direction that complements humans  and augments their skills.
+++
Over the past 40 years, the diffusion of digital technologies significantly increased income inequality.
Generative AI will surely impact inequality, but the nature of that effect depends on exactly how this technology is developed and applied. Nothing about the path of this (or any) technology is inevitable.
The private sector is pursuing a path for generative AI that emphasizes automation and the displacement of labor, along with intrusive workplace surveillance.
Simply displacing workers is never good for the labor market, even when the displaced are highly paid. Displaced formerly high-paid workers are forced to compete for jobs with lower-wage workers, leading to a downward cascade in wage levels.
A better path is available, along which generative AI would be complementary to most humans — augmenting their capabilities — including people without a four-year college degree.

The AI road not taken


The case for an 'automation tax' 


Choosing the human-complementary path is feasible but will require changes in the direction of technological innovation, as well as in corporate norms and behavior.
The goal should be to deploy generative AI to create and support new occupational tasks and new capabilities for workers. If AI tools can enable teachers, nurse practitioners, nurses, medical technicians, electricians, plumbers, and other modern craft workers to do more expert work, this can reduce inequality, raise productivity, and boost pay by leveling workers up.
Public policy has a central role in encouraging this positive path of technology to complement all workers, elevating the achievable level of skill and expertise for everyone. 
At this time, the five most important federal policies should be:
Equalize tax rates on employing workers and on owning equipment/ algorithms to level the playing field between people and machines.
Update Occupational Safety and Health Administration rules to create safeguards (i.e., limitations) on the surveillance of workers. Finding ways to elevate worker voice on the direction of development could also be helpful.
Increase funding for human-complementary technology research, recognizing that this is not currently a private sector priority.
Create an AI center of expertise within the government, to help share knowledge among regulators and other officials.
Use that federal expertise to advise on whether purported human-complementary technology is appropriate to adopt in publicly provided education and healthcare programs, including at the state and local level.

Cheryl Porro



					SVP, Engineering, Betterworks				




October 9, 2023




 








Cheryl Porro of Betterworks explores the game-changing impact of Generative AI on HR performance management and the path to a more equitable, agile, and empowered workforce.
Let’s face it: Human resources professionals are inundated with technology solutions to solve problems, with some working better than others. From applicant tracking systems, human resources information systems, and employee engagement software to onboarding, benefits, and payroll technology, the list is endless regarding streamlining and enhancing organizational processes. 
However, one HR technology solution has failed since its inception in the 1920s: performance management software. That’s because it’s built on faulty ground, the misguided belief that a militaristic model of hierarchy and control form the best basis for managing collaborative teams toward business outcomes and, understandably so, is universally hated. Most HR leaders and employees will lament the bureaucratic process when completing the much-begrudged annual performance review. HR professionals and employees know it’s dreadful and doesn’t change performance.
Time for Change: As Work Dynamics Evolve, So Should Performance Management
Fast forward to today, over 100 years later, and work has radically changed. Performance management, however, still needs to be improved and more effective. They do it to check the box without a true grasp on why they do it other than because that’s how it’s always been done. We know that the evolution of performance management processes is imminent to create a happier and more productive workforce.
We also know that this said evolution required to transform workforces just got more interesting – as what might be the most transformational technology of our time, generative AI, promises to impact the interaction between humans and machines fundamentally. The buzz surrounding AI and how it will affect our work cannot be ignored. There is a vast opportunity in front of us— especially HR leaders.

AI and HR Transformation: Generative AI Is Poised to Reinvent Performance Management
The hype cycles in technology are aplenty. You might think that AI is just another industry fad and that the passionate conversations around us will die down soon, but these conversations have happened for the past decade. The technology is just improving at a quick rate, adding to its virality this time around. While the initial excitement may fade, AI integrations into everyday performance management processes will become the norm. For HR leaders, we’re entering an important time where we can leverage its benefits to enhance employee experiences and, as a result, drive stronger business outcomes.
I’m optimistic that generative AI is well on its way to helping HR teams transform workforce performance by doing things like detecting and eliminating unconscious bias from the performance evaluation process, boosting goal quality, encouraging goal achievement, simplifying the arduous process of conducting performance reviews, prompting timely recognition, providing tailored coaching suggestions, and much more. It will help employees work faster, smarter, and more productively. It will help managers in becoming better managers and coaches.
Practical Magic: How Managers Can Implement AI to Become More Effective at Cultivating Talent
With the help of AI, managers, in particular, are positioned to become more effective and efficient at cultivating talent by understanding their talent pool, what skills they have, and where the gaps lie. With these added insights, managers can do more for employee development in recognizing wins, automating 1:1 check-ins, suggesting skills development areas where the organization is comparatively weak, or matching employees’ career development goals with available opportunities.
If we leave it to AI to get it right regarding strengths, weaknesses, skill sets, building relationships, and connections, it won’t work. AI could and is likely to get it wrong. The combination of human intuition and AI makes it exceptionally powerful. This has to be a partnership governed by the human responsible for the people.
The human element of the performance process doesn’t go away:, with the assistance of AI to streamline more administrative tasks, one could argue that it’s enhanced. Imagine a day where the manager has a complete perspective on the employee’s contribution to goals without digging around to find scraps of incomplete information. The manager spends more time understanding the data, seeing recommendations on how to help the employee, and ultimately decides the right coaching. What is the priority? How does the person need to hear this? How does this connect to other things I know that are going on in the person’s life? A manager’s EQ is not replaceable, and with the power of generative AI, they are given insights at the moment it matters to drive meaningful conversations.
It’s becoming increasingly clear that AI is rapidly becoming a necessary staple, inside and outside of HR, because it can also do rote, repetitive tasks much faster and more accurately than humans. It’s accelerating productivity. Resisting it puts your organization at risk of falling behind. However, its benefits cannot be discussed at length without also addressing the perceived risks of AI that linger quite heavily: proprietary information leaks, sources being unknown, copyright infringement, plagiarism, making the workplace less human, lack of critical thinking, too much similarity across content where variety and specificity is essential (i.e., feedback and performance reviews), and the widespread concern of unconscious bias.
Thoughtful change management, which includes communicating these benefits and risks, is essential in the company-wide adoption of AI. Organizational leaders are wise to consider what can go right and wrong with the technology so that guardrails can be put in place to ensure governance, privacy, and security before these changes are implemented. Without an effective change management plan, organizations can stifle their ability to use this technology effectively, even as deceivingly simple as ChatGPT.

The Path Forward: Embracing the AI-HR Convergence One Step at a Time
HR leaders can start by implementing small-scale pilot projects to demonstrate the value and feasibility of AI within performance management processes. They can also encourage employees to jump in with low-risk use cases of generative AI. Tell employees what you’re doing, how you’re approaching it, and what opportunities there are for them to make it a success. Allow employees to share their successes as they experiment with the technology. Be clear about what “unauthorized use” means. Then, memorialize it as part of a company policy.
Employees, customers, and partners will all expect organizations to be transparent about their use of generative AI and the policies in place to keep their data safe. Everyone’s appetite for AI is going to be different. Some may be asking where that “button” is to fill in information for them automatically, and others will be hesitant to trust it. We’re still in a time where employees are reacting to technology, so organizations will need the processes and infrastructure in place for them to opt in. 
With open dialogue and setting clear boundaries, organizations are ready to tap into the potential of generative AI. The promise of AI might seem like another fleeting phenomenon to some, but its integration into HR practices is not just a fad; it’s a paradigm shift that will reshape the employee experience for the better. The urgency is there, and some may rush into adopting it. But more than anything, HR leaders have the chance to do it right by thinking about the end user and putting their needs first: employees. It can dismantle biases ingrained in evaluations, elevate goal-setting precision, and catalyze timely recognition. AI refines performance reviews and empowers managers to step into a new role — one of strategic coaches who guide their teams toward greater success.
The convergence of AI and HR represents a pivotal moment, a turning point in how we perceive and manage performance. Human resources leaders have a unique opportunity to harness generative AI’s potential, paving the way for a more equitable, agile, and empowered workforce. The journey may be complex, but it holds the promise of tapping into human potential, embracing innovation, and shaping the future of work for the better.

The initial surge of excitement and apprehension surrounding ChatGPT is waning. The problem is, where does that leave the enterprise? Is this a passing trend that can safely be ignored or a powerful tool that needs to be embraced? And if the latter, what’s the most secure approach to its adoption?
ChatGPT, a form of generative AI, represents just a single manifestation of the broader concept of large language models (LLMs). LLMs are an important technology that’s here to stay, but they’re not a plug-and-play solution for your business processes. Achieving benefits from them requires some work on your part.

[ Read next: What can ChatGPT and LLMs really do for your business? ]

This is because, despite the immense potential of LLMs, they come with a range of challenges. These challenges include issues such as hallucinations, the high costs associated with training and scaling, the complexity of addressing and updating them, their inherent inconsistency, the difficulty of conducting audits and providing explanations, and the predominance of English language content.











 
 
 
There are also other factors like the fact that LLMs are poor at reasoning and need careful prompting for correct answers. All of these issues can be minimized by supporting your new internal corpus-based LLM by a knowledge graph.

The power of knowledge graphs
A knowledge graph is an information-rich structure that provides a view of entities and how they interrelate. For example, Rishi Sunak holds the office of prime minister of the UK. Rishi Sunak and the UK are entities, and holding the office of prime minister is how they relate. We can express these identities and relationships as a network of assertable facts with a graph of what we know.
Having built a knowledge graph, you not only can query it for patterns, such as “Who are the members of Rishi Sunak’s cabinet,” but you can also compute over the graph using graph algorithms and graph data science. With this additional tooling, you can ask sophisticated questions about the nature of the whole graph of many billions of elements, not just a subgraph. Now you can ask questions like “Who are the members of the Sunak government not in the cabinet who wield the most influence?”











 
 
 
Expressing these relationships as a graph can uncover facts that were previously obscured and lead to valuable insights. You can even generate embeddings from this graph (encompassing both its data and its structure) that can be used in machine learning pipelines or as an integration point to LLMs.
Using knowledge graphs with large language models
But a knowledge graph is only half the story. LLMs are the other half, and we need to understand how to make these work together. We see four patterns emerging:

Use an LLM to create a knowledge graph.
Use a knowledge graph to train an LLM.
Use a knowledge graph on the interaction path with an LLM to enrich queries and responses.
Use knowledge graphs to create better models.

In the first pattern we use the natural language processing features of LLMs to process a huge corpus of text data (e.g. from the web or journals). We then ask the LLM (which is opaque) to produce a knowledge graph (which is transparent). The knowledge graph can be inspected, QA’d, and curated. Importantly for regulated industries like pharmaceuticals, the knowledge graph is explicit and deterministic about its answers in a way that LLMs are not.











 
 
 
In the second pattern we do the opposite. Instead of training LLMs on a large general corpus, we train them exclusively on our existing knowledge graph. Now we can build chatbots that are very skilled with respect to our products and services and that answer without hallucination.
In the third pattern we intercept messages going to and from the LLM and enrich them with data from our knowledge graph. For example, “Show me the latest five films with actors I like” cannot be answered by the LLM alone, but it can be enriched by exploring a movie knowledge graph for popular films and their actors that can then be used to enrich the prompt given to the LLM. Similarly, on the way back from the LLM, we can take embeddings and resolve them against the knowledge graph to provide deeper insight to the caller.
The fourth pattern is about making better AIs with knowledge graphs. Here interesting research from Yejen Choi at the University of Washington shows the best way forward. In her team’s work, an LLM is enriched by a secondary, smaller AI called a “critic.” This AI looks for reasoning errors in the responses of the LLM, and in doing so creates a knowledge graph for downstream consumption by another training process that creates a “student” model. The student model is smaller and more accurate than the original LLM on many benchmarks because it never learns factual inaccuracies or inconsistent answers to questions.











 
 
 
Understanding Earth’s biodiversity using knowledge graphs
It’s important to remind ourselves of why we are doing this work with ChatGPT-like tools. Using generative AI can help knowledge workers and specialists to execute natural language queries they want answered without having to understand and interpret a query language or build multi-layered APIs. This has the potential to increase efficiency and allow employees to focus their time and energy on more pertinent tasks.
Take Basecamp Research, a UK-based biotech firm that is mapping Earth’s biodiversity and trying to ethically support bringing new solutions from nature into the market. To do so it has built the planet’s largest natural biodiversity knowledge graph, BaseGraph, which has more than four billion relationships.
The dataset is feeding a lot of other innovative projects. One is protein design, where the team is utilizing a large language model fronted by a ChatGPT-style model for enzyme sequence generation called ZymCtrl. Purpose-built for generative AI, Basecamp is now wrapping increasingly more LLMs around its entire knowledge graph. The firm is upgrading BaseGraph to a fully LLM-augmented knowledge graph in just the way I’ve been describing.











 
 
 
Making complex content more findable, accessible, and explainable
Pioneering as Basecamp Research’s work is, it’s not alone in exploring the LLM-knowledge graph combination. A household-name global energy company is using knowledge graphs with ChatGPT in the cloud for its enterprise knowledge hub. The next step is to deliver generative AI-powered cognitive services to thousands of employees across its legal, engineering, and other departments.
To take one more example, a global publisher is readying a generative AI tool trained on knowledge graphs that will make a huge wealth of complex academic content more findable, accessible, and explainable to research customers using pure natural language.
What’s noteworthy about this latter project is that it aligns perfectly with our earlier discussion: translating hugely complex ideas into accessible, intuitive, real-world language, enabling interactions and collaborations. In doing so, it empowers us to tackle substantial challenges with precision, and in ways that people trust.

It’s becoming increasingly clear that by training an LLM on a knowledge graph’s curated, high-quality, structured data, the gamut of challenges associated with ChatGPT will be addressed, and the prizes you are seeking from generative AI will be easier to realize. A June Gartner report, AI Design Patterns for Knowledge Graphs and Generative AI, underscores this notion, emphasizing that knowledge graphs offer an ideal partner to an LLM, where high levels of accuracy and correctness are a requirement.
Seems like a marriage made in heaven to me. What about you?

Generative AI slashes cloud migration hassles, says McKinsey partner

Bhargs Srivathsan also urges enterprises to ditch the tech Lamborghinis for efficient ride




Laura Dobberstein                                



Wed 11 Oct 2023                                     // 
11:31 UTC                                



































The use of generative AI is cutting down cloud migration efforts by 30 percent to 50 percent when done correctly, according to McKinsey's Bhargs Srivathsan, speaking at a conference in Singapore on Wednesday.
""This is only starting to scratch the surface. As the large language model (LLM) matures, this timeline to migrate workloads to public cloud will just keep going down – and hopefully the migration will also be efficient,"" said Srivathsan.
She advised that organizations can use an LLM to understand what a system's infrastructure looks like, decipher its weaknesses and strengths, move the workloads, and then apply AI-based tools to understand if the migration actually worked.







It can also lean on LLMs for tasks such as producing Architecture Review Board guidelines.











The McKinsey partner said although many enterprises are just starting to think about implementing AI, 40 percent of those that have already invested are updating their investment.
Srivathsan called the relationship between generative AI and cloud ""symbiotic.""







""We absolutely cannot deny that cloud really is needed to bring generative AI to life. And, similarly, generative AI can really accelerate the migration to public cloud, as well as the unlock from it,"" she said.
The four biggest use cases Srivathsan sees for generative AI are content generation, customer engagement, creating synthetic data, and coding. The latter role is especially useful when working on legacy code written by coders who are long gone from an organization, or when such code needs translating to a new programming language.
She stressed the need to use public cloud instead of attempting to build in-house models as enterprises don't typically have the necessary access to GPUs. Off-the-shelf models are also cheaper.

More and more LLMs in biz products, but who'll take responsibility for their output?

Intel CTO suggests using AI to port CUDA code to – surprise! – Intel chips

Those working in regulated industries, with large amounts of proprietary data or concerned about IP infringement, can put guardrails in place, Srivathsan said.
She also stressed that LLMs will stay in hyperscale environments for the next five to six years until models mature. While many people feel the need to be closer to their compute power, she advised that very few use cases actually need ultra low latency.


Unless you are Tesla operating self-driving or perhaps operating in real time on a manufacturing floor, it's just not necessary, she said.
There is also no need to require tailored or massive models.
""Many enterprises think they need a Lamborghini to deliver a pizza, you definitely don't, you probably don't need as complex and as big as a model, you don't need a 65 billion parametric model to generate customer support scripts, for example,"" said the McKinsey partner.
However, she recommended not skimping on an API gateway between an organization and the outside world in order to surface some of the ""real-time alerts"" if developers are accessing non-proprietary models or data they shouldn't be touching. ® Whitepaper: Top 5 Tips For Navigating Your SASE Journey

But with great promise come great concerns, including—but certainly not limited to—the spread of misinformation at scale, especially via deepfakes; using creators’ work without attribution; and massive job loss thanks to automation. 

With those potential downsides in mind, governments around the world are attempting to create AI regulations that promote safety and fair use while still encouraging innovation.

US 🇺🇸

The US government has so far let tech companies come up with their own safeguards around AI. But lawmakers say that AI regulation is necessary. They have held multiple meetings in 2023 with leading AI companies from OpenAI to Nvidia. Lawmakers have discussed licensing and certification requirements of high-risk AI models when necessary.

 Meanwhile, federal agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Department of Justice, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and the Federal Trade Commission have said that many AI applications are already subject to existing laws.

UK 🇬🇧

The United Kingdom, which is home to AI companies like Google’s AI lab DeepMind and AI video maker Synthesia, wants to avoid heavy-handed legislation that could stifle innovation. Regulation would be based on principles such as safety, transparency, fairness, and accountability, reported Reuters.

The UK government also wants to play a key role in regulating AI. It is expected to hold its first AI safety summit on Nov. 1 and Nov. 2. “The UK has long been home to the transformative technologies of the future,” Prime minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement. “To fully embrace the extraordinary opportunities of artificial intelligence, we must grip and tackle the risks to ensure it develops safely in the years ahead.”

The country plans to split responsibility for governing AI between existing regulators for human rights, health and safety, and competition rather than creating a new body dedicated to the technology—which differs from US regulators who have discussed creating an independent body to oversee the licensing of high-risk AI models. Academics have criticized the independent regulator, saying that it will take time to create an entirely new agency.

EU 🇪🇺

Since 2021, the EU, which has a track record of implementing stricter rules on the tech industry compared to other regions, has been working towards passing the AI Act, which would be the first AI law in the West. 

The act proposes classifying AI systems by risk. Higher-risk systems, including AI hiring tools and exam scoring software, would face greater compliance standards, such as data validation and documentation, compared to lower-risk ones. The proposed rules also prohibit intrusive and discriminatory uses of AI, such as real-time remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces or predictive policy systems based on profiling. 

 Last month, European Commission committee member Thierry Breton said that the EU is developing an AI Pact that will help companies prepare for the implementation of the AI Act and that startups—not just Big Tech—need to be included in discussions around developing governance of AI. Startups in the past have said that the EU’s proposed regulation is too restrictive.

China 🇨🇳

In China, generative AI providers must undergo a security assessment, and AI tools must adhere to socialist values. But generative AI technology developed only for use outside of the country is exempt from the rules.  Chinese tech companies like Baidu, Tencent, and Huawei have research and development centers in Silicon Valley. 

To rival OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the country’s biggest internet companies—Alibaba, Baidu, and JD—have announced their own AI chatbots. In the past, China has said it wanted to be the world leader in AI by 2030 and has laid out plans to commercialize AI in a number of areas from smart cities to military uses, as CNBC reported. 

Japan 🇯🇵

Japan is leaning towards softer rules governing the use of AI. This week, prime minister Fumio Kishida pledged that the next economic package will include funds for AI development in small and midsize companies, which could help boost Japan’s lost lead in technology.

Japan has also said that using copyrighted images to train AI models doesn’t violate copyright laws, which means that generative AI providers can use copyrighted work without securing permission from the owners of the images. “In Japan, works for information analysis can be used regardless of the method, whether for non-profit purposes, for profit, for acts other than reproduction, or for content obtained from illegal sites,” said a member of the House of Representatives for the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan. 

That said, the representative acknowledged that using the image against the will of the copyright holder is problematic from the viewpoint of rights protection, and suggested a need for “new regulations to protect copyright holders.” 

Brazil 🇧🇷

Lawmakers in Brazil have started to draft regulations for AI that include requiring providers of AI systems to submit a risk assessment before rolling out the product to the public. 


Regardless of the risk classification of AI systems, regulators say that people affected by those systems have the right to an explanation about a decision or a recommendation made within 15 days of the request. Academic experts contend that it’s hard to explain why an AI system does something.

Israel 🇮🇱

The country, which has been having discussions with both Israeli and US-based tech companies, has proposed regulation that focuses on “responsible innovation” that protects the public while also advancing Israeli’s high-tech industry.

The government has said, vaguely, that AI policy will include the use of “soft” regulatory tools to govern AI and the adoption of ethical principles similar to what is acceptable around the world. Regulation is expected to arrive “in the coming years.”

Italy 🇮🇹

In March, Italy was the first Western country to—temporarily—ban ChatGPT over unlawful data collection. Since then, the government said it has allocated 30 million euros (or $33 million) to help unemployed people and workers in positions at risk of automation to boost their digital skills.

Nearly all (96%) of employers believe that generative artificial intelligence will have an impact on their business, but there seems to be a slow adoption of the technology, according to a recent report.
Overall, just 4% of employers say that generative AI will not affect them. Yet, just 9% of companies have fully deployed a generative AI use case in their organization, reports MIT Technology Review Insights.
It seems employers are still unsure about a lot of things around AI, and that’s causing them to delay adoption. The primary challenges employers face in successfully implementing generative AI include:










understanding the risks (59%)
better understanding data (51%)
developing use cases (42%)
engaging with regulators or uncertainty around regulation (40%)
hiring talent or upskilling employees around generative AI (26%)

""Business leaders are cautiously pursuing the transformative potential of generative AI, with nearly all respondents acknowledging its impact on their businesses,"" says Laurel Ruma, global editorial director, MIT Technology Review Insights. ""However, only a small fraction have fully embraced generative AI use cases, highlighting a measured approach to implementation. Workforce implications vary across industries, and while regulation looms, uncertainty stands as today's primary challenge.""
Currently, only 26% of employees say that their employer has a policy related to the use of generative AI, and 23% say that such a policy is under development, according to a previous report from The Conference Board. Over a third (34%) say their organization does not have an AI policy, and 17% don't know.
Who’s leading the charge in generative AI adoption?
When it comes to the adoption of generative AI, small companies (those with annual revenue less than $500 million) are three times more likely than mid-sized firms ($500 million to $1 billion) to have already deployed a generative AI use case (13% versus 4%), reports MIT Technology Review Insights.
In fact, these small companies had deployment and experimentation rates similar to those of the very largest companies (those with revenue greater than $10 billion), based on the survey of 1,000 business leaders in July and August 2023.
“Affordable generative AI tools could boost smaller businesses in the same way as cloud computing, which granted companies access to tools and computational resources that would once have required huge financial investments in hardware and technical expertise,” says MIT Technology Review Insights.

Also, while 75% of executives plan to work with partners to bring generative AI to their organization at scale, they are somewhat more likely to plan to team up with small AI-focused companies (43%) than large tech firms (32%).
While previous reports have caused fear of automation on many workers before, only one quarter of business leaders expect generative AI’s primary effect to be a reduction in their workforce. 
The figure was higher in industrial sectors like energy and utilities (43%), manufacturing (34%), and transport and logistics (31%). It was lowest in IT and telecommunications (7%).
“AI is democratizing technical skills across the workforce in ways that could lead to new job opportunities and increased employee satisfaction. But experts caution that, if deployed poorly and without meaningful consultation, generative AI could degrade the qualitative experience of human work,” says MIT Technology Review Insights.
Here’s how AI will affect the HR industry, according to HR futurist Jim Carroll.









Imbalance with skills, training opportunities
However, employers should put more focus on equipping their workers with the necessary skills to successfully use generative AI at work, says Sander van ‘t Noordende, CEO at Randstad.
“AI is increasingly an enabler and enhancer of skills, holding a profound impact on productivity and overall performance in the workplace. But the imbalance between skills demanded by businesses and desired by employees, on the one hand, and the training opportunities provided, on the other, has to be addressed,” he says.
“AI is here to stay and the benefits of it are very clear - our data shows that employees stand ready to embrace it for their own gain too. Successful organizations will be those that leverage this readiness and harness the opportunities of AI in their workforce.”

Finding the right person for the job is no walk in the park, as any recruiter will tell you. And it’s at least as challenging for job seekers to wade through the opportunities, apply for a job, and get that coveted first interview.
But iCIMS believes generative AI can help. Today, the company is announcing its own iCIMS Copilot, an AI assistant powered by the GPT-4 in Azure OpenAI Service introduced earlier this year by Microsoft that will live as a persistent, easily accessible chatbot inside the existing iCIMS Talent Cloud recruiting software, allowing recruiters to instantly ask it questions, prompt it to generate job descriptions and interview questions, draft candidate offer letters, and create marketing content around job opportunities.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



“If you’re at a point in using our products where you need to create content over and over, let the Copilot give you a starting point,” said iCIMS CTO Al Smith in an exclusive video interview with VentureBeat.
Whatever data recruiters have introduced to their secure and private iCIMS Talent Cloud instances can be drawn upon and leveraged for use by the Copilot, but users can also prompt it with their own outside data.

An AI evolution for recruiters
iCIMS is no stranger to AI. The company headquartered in Holmdel, New Jersey, was an early leader at bringing software to the recruiting journey, having been founded in 2000, and has since grown to service more than 6,000 customers across sectors, specializing in those needing a high volume of new hires and those with high turnover, such as retail outlets and seasonal businesses.
For the last five years, even long before the current generative AI gold rush, it has pursued integrating what it calls “responsible AI” with its platform, and has “worked very, very hard around the world,” according to Smith, to fulfill the various compliance requirements where it and its enterprise customers do business. 
So far, iCIMS has integrated responsible AI into its platform in the form of “AI-led search, match, and job fit recommendation capabilities to candidates,” including routing and sorting job candidates who are both the “best fit” and a “close match” to the job description. iCIMS also takes into account hard and “soft,” or derived skills when evaluating candidates to see who could grow into organizations to take on more roles. 
The importance of avoiding bias
Eliminating bias is especially critical for recruiting, where laws prohibit technology discrimination and bias in hiring. For example, Smith told VentureBeat that iCIMS is compliant with New York City’s recently enforced NYC 144 law.
“We have a big belief that AI is not this black box that says ‘bing, here’s your answer!'” explained Smith. “It should be helping you make better contextual decisions and be explainable on why it’s helping you provide that information.”
However, Smith acknowledges this explainability is a challenge with generative AI solutions like its own new iCIMS Copilot. Large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI’s GPT-4, which powers the iCIMS Copilot, are great at delivering fast answers and content on demand, but not necessarily at explaining how they arrived at those responses. 
A recruiting aid, not a replacementadvertisement
That’s why iCIMS has worked to introduce fine-tuning and safeguards around its implementation of generative AI, and views it as a recruiting aid, especially for content creation, not as a replacement for human recruiters.
Generative AI assistants can help “eliminate like the undifferentiated work that anybody could do, and let you focus more on the outcomes that you’re trying to do,” Smith said, referring to his recruiter customers.
Early innings
As VentureBeat has previously remarked, it is still early innings in the metaphorical baseball game of enterprises competing to figure out the best applications for generative AI.
iCIMS believes its Copilot is a valuable addition, but plans to offer users the chance to give feedback continuously and at multiple points through their usage.
“Honestly, I want to learn ‘what is the definition of high quality in this technology?'” said Smith. “I want feedback that when you use it, you can choose options that say ‘this was really helpful, somewhat helpful, or not helpful at all.'” advertisement
As iCIMS collects feedback from its enterprise users, it will use it to iterate and refine its Copilot, as well as add new capabilities and bring new generative AI products and tools to market.
As such, “we’re still trying to figure out the monetization side of it,” said Smith. Right now, the iCIMS Copilot will be bundled in with its regular Talent Cloud, which charges on an “enterprise pricing model,” not per user.

Powering GenAI’s potential requires purpose-built approaches to mitigate the inherent risks of its adoption.Generative AI (GenAI), the basis for tools like OpenAI ChatGPT, Google Bard and Meta LLaMa, is a new AI technology that has quickly moved front and center into the global limelight.GenAI Meets the EnterpriseToday, an estimated 60% of IT leaders are looking to implement GenAI.At the same time, concerns exist. Most notably, for about 71% of IT leaders, angst about security creates a barrier to adoption, mandating that approaches, infrastructure, data strategies and security be appropriately aligned. According to the Dell Technologies 2023 Innovation Index report, 59% of Indian businesses are currently investing or exploring the feasibility of investing in AI, Machine Learning and advanced analytics to advance innovation. Finding the right, fit-for-use GenAI model for enterprises is the key to mitigating its risks, dispelling concerns and ushering in GenAI’s mainstream adoption in the enterprise world.Pivoting to Purpose-built GenAITo enable that revolution, the way enterprises use GenAI will likely differ from general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. Instead, enterprises are likely to use GenAI models that are trained and tuned to solve specific problems; for instance, to enable automated customer support, financial forecasting and fraud detection. Although LLMs such as ChatGPT can be used for enterprise applications, the accuracy of their results will not match that of a purpose-built model created to meet a specific need.Other major benefits of purpose-built GenAI include:Data security and compliance: AI’s unique capability is handling and analyzing huge datasets with unprecedented speed and efficiency. Simply put, if AI is a rocket ship, data is the fuel. Enterprises can tune their LLMs with customer purchase history, support or telesales logs, health records, financial records and other data sources. Consequently, handling this data in a secure manner will become even more important than it is today. Additionally, some industries, such as healthcare and finance, must comply with stringent regulations regarding data privacy and security. The privacy of data that is entered into third party LLM services is the subject of intensifying debate. Thus, enterprises that need to retain control over their data must tread carefully.Agility and time to market: Most enterprises will need to update their GenAI models regularly, which is easier to do with purpose-built GenAI models. The time required to train general-purpose LLMs can take months. That’s because massive amounts of data are required for training, eclipsing deployment speed and time to market, the very benefits GenAI enables. Reducing time-to-model and facilitating faster data-to-decisions can improve business efficiency.Performance: Purpose-built models also provide performance benefits over general-purpose models. Specifically, enterprises using third party general-purpose LLMs may not be able to optimize performance and reduce the latency of their GenAI workloads. This is problematic for applications that require real-time processing or low-latency response times, a key attribute of GenAI adoption.Cost: The smaller amounts of training data needed for purpose-built GenAI models also translate into cost savings. As a result, purpose-built LLMs often cost far less to train and re-train compared to general-purpose LLMs like ChatGPT.Moving Enterprise GenAI Forward According to the Dell Technologies 2023 Innovation Index report, India has the highest number of businesses (37%) using AI-based optimization software to automate processes. For enterprises, in India and across the globe, GenAI holds the profound potential to automate complex processes, improve customer interactions and unlock new possibilities with better machine intelligence—and CIOs are the key to moving it forward. (The author is Manish Gupta, Vice President, Infrastructure Solutions Group, Dell Technologies India, and the views expressed in this article are his own)    Tags :generative-aiadd a commentLeave a Response Cancel replyCommentNameEmailSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

A recent survey conducted by ITWeb in partnership with KnowBe4 Africa examined the extent of generative AI (GenAI) adoption by SA organisations.The objective was to understand businesses’ concerns around the technology and how leaders mitigate risks.A total of 156 valid responses were captured, with 73% of respondents being at executive or middle management level. While almost half (42%) of the survey respondents came from the IT sector and 12% from financial services, the remaining 46% came from a wide range of major industry sectors.“The majority of South African organisations participating in this survey are embracing emerging technologies and embedding GenAI into their day-to-day operations,” says Anna Collard, SVP of content strategy and evangelist at KnowBe4 Africa. She continues, “However at the same time, not enough is being done to regulate the use thereof or educate their staff. Security and privacy risks, ethical concerns such as bias, inaccuracies, and impact on critical thinking are challenges that need to be addressed by a combination of regulation, guidelines and awareness training.”The majority of South African organisations...are...embedding GenAI into their day-to-day operations.Almost all (92%) of the survey respondents said they were familiar with ChatGPT and/or other GenAI technologies. Three quarters (72%) of respondents currently allow employees access to ChatGPT and/or other generative AI technologies. However, 39% of those don’t have any restrictions in place, 14% have defined process and policies, 13% have additional technical control measures and 6% say it is part of one of the products or processes that they use.The top five current and future use cases for ChatGPT or other GenAII in respondents’ organisations include:Content generation (64%)Research purposes (62%)Customer support (56%)Writing code/scripts (43%)Creative tasks (49%).The ways in which data privacy concerns are addressed when using ChatGPT or GenAI are: employee training on responsible AI usage (36%); policy (29%); and encryption (28%). A quarter (27%) of respondents say this is not addressed or regulated.Half (50%) of respondents say employees are provided with guidelines on the appropriate use and limitations of ChatGPT and GenAI. Of those providing guidelines, 67% provide basic guidelines only, while 37% are detailed. Over a third (36%) of survey respondents don’t address or regulate the potential misuse of ChatGPT or GenAI within their organisation. For those that do, the top three ways in which misuse is mitigated are: employee training on responsible AI usage (33%), policies (32%) and AI ethics and usage policies (25%).The majority of respondents (74%) say there haven’t been any incidents of misuse or security breaches related to ChatGPT or generative AI within their organisation. A quarter (22%) of respondents aren’t sure and 4% said there had been incidents.Some 30% of respondents provide basic training to employees about identifying and countering AI-generated misinformation or deepfakes. Thirteen percent of respondents provide comprehensive training and 58% say no specific training is provided around this. The majority (79%) of respondents are concerned about adversaries using generative AI like ChatGPT or uncontrolled versions of it in their attacks (i.e., better social engineering, deep fakes etc). Respondents’ main concerns about generative AI in general are:Security threats becoming more sophisticated (60%)Ethics and bias issues (49%)Impact on critical thinking (49%)Not being able to keep up with the pace of innovation and competitors (36%)Job replacements and unemployment (29%).The AI services currently in use in respondents’ organisations are ChatGPT (68%), CoPilot (27%) and Otter.ai (21%). Just over a third (36%) of respondents’ organisations have integrated ChatGPT or other generative AI into their business processes, systems or applications. Half of respondents (53%) say they’re planning to use ChatGPT or other generative AI systems in the future.Collard ends off by underlining the importance of awareness, education and training as a measure to ensure the responsible use of AI. “This is followed by a need for more regulations and policy, as well as technology to help solve the challenges.”Share",,,,,,,,,,,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@type': 'WebSite', '@id': 'https://www.itweb.co.za', 'name': 'Home'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.itweb.co.za/categories/j5alrvQgkY1MpYQk', 'name': 'Artificial Intelligence'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Survey: SA business is on board with generative AI', 'item': 'https://www.itweb.co.za/article/survey-sa-business-is-on-board-with-generative-ai/kYbe9MXbeaxvAWpG'}]",,https://www.itweb.co.za/article/survey-sa-business-is-on-board-with-generative-ai/kYbe9MXbeaxvAWpG,Survey: SA business is on board with generative AI,"['https://www.itweb.co.za/static/pictures/2023/02/Anna-Collard-Feb-2023.jpg', 'https://www.itweb.co.za/static/pictures/2023/10/Survey-SA-business-is-on-board-with-generative-AI-1-1.jpg', 'https://www.itweb.co.za/static/pictures/2023/10/Survey-SA-business-is-on-board-with-generative-AI-2.jpg', 'https://www.itweb.co.za/static/pictures/2023/10/Survey-SA-business-is-on-board-with-generative-AI-3.jpg', 'https://www.itweb.co.za/static/pictures/2023/10/Survey-SA-business-is-on-board-with-generative-AI-4.jpg']",2023-10-12T08:00:00+02:00,2024-05-20T11:53:36+02:00,"[{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Alison Job', 'url': 'https://www.itweb.co.za/contributors/gGb3Bw7WNAv2k6Vn'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2. Automating Administrative Tasks:
Administrative duties, while essential, can detract from a teacher’s core objective: educating. Grading assignments, tracking attendance, and managing timetables often consume a significant chunk of their time. AI’s automation potential comes as a saving grace, taking over these mundane tasks. For example, AI-driven systems can grade not only multiple-choice tests but, with advancements, even essays to some extent. This automation ensures consistency, reduces human error, and provides teachers more time for student interaction and curriculum planning.


3. Intelligent Content Creation:
Crafting content that resonates with every student is a challenge. With AI, teachers have tools at their disposal that can generate smart content, including customized reading material, study guides, and problem sets. These tools are informed by pedagogical best practices and are designed to enhance learning experiences. For subjects like Math and Science, AI can even generate quizzes or flashcards that adapt difficulty based on student performance, ensuring consistent progression.
4. Virtual Tutors and Assistants:
The role of an educator extends beyond classroom walls. Students often require assistance after school hours, and while teachers strive to be available, there are limits. Enter AI-powered virtual tutors. These tutors, available 24/7, can offer homework assistance, answer queries, and provide additional study resources. This doesn’t diminish a teacher’s role but supplements it, ensuring students have support whenever they need.
ad5. Enhancing Professional Development:
Continuous learning is a hallmark of great educators. AI’s analytical capabilities offer a unique advantage here. By assessing classroom interactions, teaching methodologies, and even student feedback, AI can pinpoint areas where a teacher might improve. Moreover, based on these insights, AI-driven platforms can suggest tailored professional development opportunities, whether courses, workshops, or seminars. This kind of targeted growth strategy can lead to significant advancements in teaching techniques.
6. Early Identification of Student Issues:
The holistic development of students is paramount. Beyond academic performance, there are numerous challenges students might face, from emotional and psychological hurdles to learning disabilities. AI, with its data-driven approach, can detect anomalies in student behavior or performance. By flagging these early, teachers can collaborate with parents and counselors to ensure the student receives the necessary support.
7. Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) Integration:
adThe union of AI with AR and VR is ushering in a new era of experiential learning. Imagine a literature class where students can interact with characters from a novel or a geography lesson where they can virtually traverse the Amazon rainforest. These immersive experiences, powered by AI, enhance understanding, foster curiosity, and make learning genuinely enjoyable.
8. Data-Driven Insights for Curriculum Design:
Beyond individual student performance, AI can provide insights on the effectiveness of teaching materials and curricula. By analyzing aggregate student data, educators can discern which topics are well-understood and which require additional emphasis. Such insights can inform curriculum adjustments, ensuring it remains relevant and effective.
9. Language Translation Tools:
In multilingual classrooms or where students are non-native speakers, AI-driven translation tools can be invaluable. Real-time translation can ensure every student, regardless of their primary language, has access to the same information. This fosters inclusivity and ensures no student is left behind due to language barriers.
Conclusion:


The harmonious integration of AI in education presents a promising future. Rather than replacing teachers, AI seeks to empower them, amplifying their efforts and enriching the educational landscape. On this Teacher’s Day, as we laud the invaluable contributions of educators, it’s exhilarating to imagine a future where, with AI’s assistance, they mold minds with even greater efficiency and profound impact. The dawn of AI in education heralds a new era of empowered teaching and enriched learning.
