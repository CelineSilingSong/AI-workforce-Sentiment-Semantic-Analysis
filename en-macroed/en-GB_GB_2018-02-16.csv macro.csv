""It is often the case that AI systems don't merely reach human levels of performance but significantly surpass it.  ""It is troubling, but necessary, to consider the implications of superhuman hacking, surveillance, persuasion, and physical target identification, as well as AI capabilities that are subhuman but nevertheless much more scalable than human labour.""Dr Seán Ó hÉigeartaigh, executive director of the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk and one of the co-authors, added: ""Artificial intelligence is a game changer and this report has imagined what the world could look like in the next five to 10 years. ""We live in a world that could become fraught with day-to-day hazards from the misuse of AI and we need to take ownership of the problems - because the risks are real. ""There are choices that we need to make now, and our report is a call to action for governments, institutions and individuals across the globe.""For many decades hype outstripped fact in terms of AI and machine learning. No longer. This report looks at the practices that just don't work anymore - and suggests broad approaches that might help: for example, how to design software and hardware to make it less hackable - and what type of laws and international regulations might work in tandem with this.""The 100-page report identified three areas - digital, physical and political - in which the malicious use of AI is most likely to be exploited.Contributors included OpenAI, a non-profit research firm, digital rights group The Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Center for a New American Security, a national security think-tank.Would you care if this feature had been written by a robot?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

generating growth and addressing societal issues * 65% of participants agreed that AI is likely to have a severe impact on employment in India TO OPEN UP OPPORTUNITIES A majority believed the benefits

integration requires significant time and investment, organisations would do well to prioritise those areas that could be automated with relative ease and with ready availability of data * Companies should also focus on areas which would provide the most tangible and immediate returns in terms of improved efficiency, cost savings and customer reach COST CHALLENGES * AI growth and adoption are wholly dependent on overcoming challenges related to reducing costs, securing the right talent and data, and addressing concerns around privacy and trust * The market reality we exist in currently demands that we not only work towards upskilling our people, but also produce the smartest machines that can work with us * The government is studying the use of AI through different platforms.

A change that is creating more productive and efficient work environments but is also causing professions and career models to morph, talent gaps to widen, and making it more difficult to find and retain right-fit employees. As advances in artificial intelligence (AI), automation, mobility and the nature of work evolve at the workplace, talent acquisition and retention — already one of the biggest challenges companies face — will become more important than ever.The good news is many of these technologies, especially AI, are also transforming the way we identify and hire talent, making the process more productive, efficient, and diverse.Though in its early stages, AI is already able to match job seekers with jobs, and in the near future, AI assistance will be crucial in helping companies retain employees and in helping individuals grow and meet their career aspirations.Impact of AI on the hiring processJob descriptions:In my last post, I commented on the prehistoric nature of job descriptions and resumes — how they are difficult to understand, one dimensional and often infused with human biases.Going forward, job descriptions and resumes will become more personalised and augmented with time-saving features. Job descriptions will highlight the elements of a job that are most interesting to a candidate’s personal preferences, promoting skill sets and experiences that will help attract the candidate’s attention.

Or one that allows an employer to ask detailed questions about a candidate’s experience. Not only will many questions be resolved at this stage, those that cannot will be routed to hiring managers for answers, and more importantly, be used to train the system for the future.Streamlining candidate skill evaluations:It is difficult to evaluate thousands of applications fairly and efficiently. Today, recruiters and hiring managers use schools, employers and work history on a candidate’s resume as indicators of fit and future performance.While there is value in knowing someone has spent years working on something that is relevant to the job at hand, the best way to demonstrate job competency or credibility is to be able to translate that experience into real life scenarios. This allows potential employers to see if a candidate can perform the duties of a position in a simulated work evaluation. Some examples:A software developer undertakes a graded coding exercise while interacting with future (or virtual) coworkers.A financial analyst develops a financial model and gets graded on a conversation about financial regulations and best practices.A bilingual technical support analyst is evaluated for speaking fluency, handling upset customers, and their ability to learn unfamiliar systems.These are typical situations in today’s interview processes but they currently use a lot of resources and are dependent on the interviewer’s skills. AI can augment resumes by automating these types of assessments. In doing so they can give hiring managers an unbiased ranking of potential candidates’ qualifications. Imagine a library of tens of thousands of assessments where a hiring manager can select a customised set of job competency simulations for a needed role. These customised evaluations can provide both parties with the transparency needed to find the right fit, while saving time for higher level human connections that can build trust between both parties and result in a high-confidence hire.Post-hire career planning:AI’s role doesn’t end when a job seeker accepts a job. Today’s workers expect to switch jobs at least several times over the course of a career.Studies show the newest generation in the workforce, millennials, switch jobs more frequently than previous generations. Companies would prefer those job changes be internal. AI can help employers map out an individual’s career path to ensure employees stay at their company. And AI algorithms, when given skill sets, performance, and desires, can even help employers know what to do to keep employees growing within their organisation.Likewise, AI can help the employee understand what to do now to ensure future career success. Imagine AI that notifies you when you should ask for a raise, clue you in to take a training course, or connect you with the right people to make your career aspirations come true.The future of job matching Matching technology is continuing to evolve — becoming more personalised, seamless and automated.

Is Jerry ready for art made by algorithms?

Thanks to great advances in artificial intelligence, humans aren’t the only ones making art anymore. As computers get in on the creative action, art critic Jerry Saltz has taken their efforts to task, offering some fairly savage reviews of works of art generated by various algorithms.
In a segment on HBO’s VICE News Tonight, Saltz was asked to judge a series of works made by AI rather than by human hands. “I’m looking for humanity, dignity, horror, originality,” he said, laying out his criterion for a successful piece.
Jerry Saltz wasn’t impressed with this work of art created by Artificial Intelligence. Screen shot via YouTube.
Saltz slammed a Google Deep Dream work—made by enhancing patterns in existing images—for selecting a banal dog for its subject matter, but he admitted: “I don’t hate this.” He compared the image’s horror vacui—a lack empty space, with details filling every section of the work—to Northwest Coast American Indian art. Another piece by the algorithm was faintly praised as “a good knockoff Shepard Fairey.”
An untitled painting by GAN algorithm from Mario Klingemann, which has been trained on female selfies and historical portraits of men, got mixed reviews. Saltz likened it to the work of Lisa Yuskavage, known for her colorful paintings of women. Ultimately, however, the computer’s effort lacked depth and was more akin to “bad album cover from the 1970s.”
Jerry Saltz compared this work of art created by Artificial Intelligence to Native American art. Screen shot via YouTube.
Saltz declined to compare Palimpsest by AICON, an algorithm that has been trained to replicate Western art, to the work of any specific artist, “because I don’t think any artist was this boring.” But he praised Portrait of Elle Reeve, saying “this is the first image I’ve seen that doesn’t look like a computer made it.”
The piece was made by Pindar Van Arman using Cloud Painter, a robot controlled by multiple creative algorithms. But while Saltz acknowledged the robot’s “good taste” in Post-Impressionist art and admitted he might have been fooled into thinking a human made it, he insisted that even the best effort of today’s AI technology “doesn’t come close to art.”

About Bidgely 









The United States is the single most privileged country on the face of this planet by far, yet inexplicably some of her citizens believe that they’re somehow oppressed. As they bask in the safe glow of their temperature controlled homes, spewing froth vitriol over the Internet using their expensive laptops and smartphones, they fail to realize that the mere fact that they have electricity with close to a 99.99% availability is nothing short of a miracle. The massive amounts of infrastructure that were engineered and built to provide sustained electricity, the men that go out in the freezing cold and blazing sun to repair said infrastructure, and the efficiency and dependability at which the whole thing operates, is taken for granted by nearly everyone. At least once a month though, we’re all given a chance to complain about it when the energy bill arrives.
To be fair, your bog standard energy bill is still fairly archaic. It shows some dollar amount that usually goes up or down depending on the season, along with a rudimentary graph that shows your energy usage over time. It looks something like this:

If you’re looking to understand a bit more about how much energy you use in your household, that piece of paper isn’t very insightful. Wouldn’t it be great if you could receive an itemized bill which showed exactly what appliances consumed that energy that you’re paying for? That may soon become a reality thanks to the wonders of artificial intelligence.
We’ve talked before about how Google used their own artificial intelligence creation, Deepmind, to cut their power bills by up to 40%. Other companies have followed suite like Verdigris Technologies which helps commercial buildings cut their energy bills. Now we’re going to take a look at another company that just took in a pretty meaningful funding round last month in the pursuit of using machine learning to help you better understand your energy consumption.
About Bidgely
If you’re feeling oppressed, try spending some time in India where the trains are so packed that people often get killed on their way to work at extremely competitive jobs with long hours and little reward for which they are extremely grateful for the opportunity. While you’re spending time in India, you may also come away with a newly found appreciation for dependable bidgley (that’s the Hindi word for electricity). It’s also the name of a Sunnyvalle, California startup which was founded in 2010 and has since taken in close to $52 million in funding to develop software that uses artificial intelligence to itemize household energy bills. So how does it work?
What Bidgely does is referred to as “energy disaggregation” and it involves itemizing consumers’ energy data into individual appliances using machine learning algorithms without any hardware needing to be installed. That’s right. Bidgely performs its disaggregation through meter data alone without the customer needing to install any hardware whatsoever. They claim to be the industry leader in “disaggregation technology” which works for both smart meters and monthly-read meters. If you’re unfamiliar with what a smart meter is, it simply allows for two-way communication between the meter and the power company. It’s these smart meters that allow Bidgely to do what they do.

Bidgely’s patented energy disaggregation technology detects and extracts appliance fingerprints from smart meter data. The data is converted into itemized energy bills and useful insights. Leveraging a database of over 50B meter readings from smart meters, Bidgely’s machine learning models extend itemization to non Smart Meter homes using a “matched peer” or a “matched region” approach.

That’s pretty remarkable that they can perform actual itemization without installing any hardware. It’s not just statistical models that provide “typical usage” either. Bidgely says that if the consumer goes on vacation or upgrades an appliance, the itemization will reflect the change. One of the examples they provide is when a utility company offers a new air conditioning unit and claims that it will offer energy savings. Using a statistical model, energy consumption will be reduced, but the percentage attributed to “cooling” will not change. Using proper “energy disaggregation” will show the change so the customer can actually see the impact:

They claim to offer this solution at a fraction of the cost that hardware-based solutions would incur and they can reach 100% of homes out there, regardless of the types of meters being used. Well, only those homes that are lucky enough to have electricity in the first place of course, which is a market of 5.6 billion people at the moment. At the moment they’ve only captured 10 million homes, thus the need for their latest funding round to scale the solution as quick as possible. They’re working in 10 countries at the moment, which shows that borders won’t present any barriers to their future expansion plans.
The platform is cloud-based which means that utilities can simply plug in to it and begin offering the solution under their own brand name. In addition to telling people which appliances are consuming the energy they’re paying for, there are also other ways to engage customers such as through gamification. The proof is in the pudding as they say, and a look at their customer list shows some big name utilities have signed on:

Two of the energy names seen above are also investors in Bidgely. German company E.ON is one of the world’s largest investor-owned electric utility service providers with more than 56,000 employees and 2015 revenues of $144 billion. The second large utility invested in Bidgely is Exelon (NYSE:EXC), a publicly traded utility that generates revenues of approximately $34.5 billion and employs approximately 34,000 people. Utilities have more interest in just conserving energy since all that big data that Bidgely is capturing will be useful to aggregate and analyze for additional insights. That’s one of the goals that Bidgely has alongside their latest funding round – “business intelligence applied to broader decision-making within utilities and energy retailers“. It’s only a matter of time before we all have itemized electricity bills arriving in our inboxes thanks to the wonders of artificial intelligence. Well, those of us that are fortunate enough to have electricity that is.

At its best, it offers new possibilities for tackling the problems people face in their professional and personal lives today.These days, artificial intelligence (or AI) is rarely out of the headlines. Each day — or so it seems — new advances are made and new uses found for this technology.For instance, according to recent reports, Facebook is using AI to identify and remove terrorist content, and even prevent suicide. Google’s AI DeepMind became a master of the ancient Chinese game of Go by repeatedly playing against itself.Meanwhile, one self-driving car pioneer has reportedly established a nonprofit religious organisation to “…develop and promote the realisation of a Godhead based on artificial intelligence.”Phew! Those are some big claims, and whether they will all bear fruit remains to be seen.But it’s undeniable that AI has left the realm of science fiction and is today science fact — and recruiting is no exception. When it comes to the world of work, AI is already changing the way people hire and search for jobs. At its best, it offers new possibilities for tackling the problems people face in their professional and personal lives today.Let’s take a look at how and where it’s already making a positive difference.Machines as matchmakersSign up for our exclusive newsletters.Subscribe to check out our popular newsletters.* indicates mandatory fieldsIt’s understandable if you’re a little unsettled at the thought of AI changing the way you recruit talent. Maybe you’re picturing your clients receiving messages and answers from a cold, impersonal machine. Or worse, perhaps you’re worried that a humanoid robot will plot to take over your position (and then your company . . . and then the world!)But the truth is, AI is a tool that serves us.Every recruiter wants to create the best possible match between a job seeker and the right job opening. And with greater access to relevant data than ever before, recruiters are (theoretically) in a better position than ever to make this happen.The problem is that too much data is indigestible for humans. We’re not always sure what to do with it, or where to get the data we need, and this applies to recruiting as much as any field.AI technology can improve the odds of creating a great match — even right at the beginning of the process — by applying algorithms and making predictions that select only the most relevant jobs before showing them to job seekers.Let’s say a job description is unclear or contains gaps. Algorithms can step in to estimate salaries or classify unusual or eccentric job titles that nobody actually searches for (“Digital Overlord”, anyone?).Using natural language processing abilities, AI can also comb through what are often text-heavy and unstructured resumes to pinpoint critical information and paint a more accurate picture of the ideal job for a particular candidate.The result? Job seekers see the jobs they need to see, and are provided with the information essential to making an informed decision — meaning less wasted time and better matches for recruiter and job seeker alike.Using AI to reduce unconscious biasBut that’s not all. AI can also carry out a wide range of recruiting and HR-related tasks. Keeping the job seeker safe from scams and protecting personal data is an important requirement in today’s world. AI helps manage this process, using signals to identify and eliminate poor-quality sites, posts and scams.It can also help reduce human bias. Take the new technology of automated assessments, for example, which gives HR and recruiting professionals insight into how a candidate would perform certain job tasks.Here’s an example of how it works: A large contact centre in the EU needed to source seven different languages in one location. Now typically, a recruiter might typically have that person speak with a language specialist as part of the application process.But doing evaluations with so many candidates and multiple different language specialists not only places a strain on resources, it also introduces a lot of subjectivity into the process.Instead, the employer used AI-powered language proficiency assessments. This may sound like science fiction but it isn’t: Each candidate had a 10-minute phone conversation with the AI agent in that assigned language. During those conversations, the AI technology automatically evaluated the candidates’ fluency and communications skills.The result? A far more efficient, less stressful process. Not bad for a cold, impersonal machine — and this is just the tip of the iceberg.Liberating employers to focus on the human side of hiringEven as AI continues to make significant advances, it is never going to replace human recruiters. Rather it will enhance and improve our work.The current capabilities rely on human beings to apply and use that technology and ensure that everything runs smoothly. But there’s more to it than that: no matter how advanced the technology gets, recruiting will remain a fundamentally human activity.When job seekers and employers interact with great recruiters, they build trust, loyalty and a sense of teamwork — and this cannot be replicated by machines. The role of AI is to free up more time for recruiters, so they can place more focus on the human relationships that make them great at what they do. AI may be able to beat us at a game of “Go” but it will never beat us at that.(Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of YourStory.)Advertise with usrecruitmentartificialintelligencehuman resourcehiring processAI technologyAdvertise with usMOST VIEWED STORIES1NewsSimple Viral Games raises Rs 4 crore from WEH Ventures, PointOne Capital, others2In-focusInteligen wants to turn math fear into math love through games and activities 3FundingIdeaForge acquires non-controlling stake in spacetech startup GalaxEye

At its best, it offers new possibilities for tackling the problems people face in their professional and personal lives today.These days, artificial intelligence (or AI) is rarely out of the headlines. Each day — or so it seems — new advances are made and new uses found for this technology.For instance, according to recent reports, Facebook is using AI to identify and remove terrorist content, and even prevent suicide. Google’s AI DeepMind became a master of the ancient Chinese game of Go by repeatedly playing against itself.Meanwhile, one self-driving car pioneer has reportedly established a nonprofit religious organisation to “…develop and promote the realisation of a Godhead based on artificial intelligence.”Phew! Those are some big claims, and whether they will all bear fruit remains to be seen.But it’s undeniable that AI has left the realm of science fiction and is today science fact — and recruiting is no exception. When it comes to the world of work, AI is already changing the way people hire and search for jobs. At its best, it offers new possibilities for tackling the problems people face in their professional and personal lives today.Let’s take a look at how and where it’s already making a positive difference.MACHINES AS MATCHMAKERSIt’s understandable if you’re a little unsettled at the thought of AI changing the way you recruit talent. Maybe you’re picturing your clients receiving messages and answers from a cold, impersonal machine. Or worse, perhaps you’re worried that a humanoid robot will plot to take over your position (and then your company . . . and then the world!)But the truth is, AI is a tool that serves us.Every recruiter wants to create the best possible match between a job seeker and the right job opening. And with greater access to relevant data than ever before, recruiters are (theoretically) in a better position than ever to make this happen.> The problem is that too much data is indigestible for humans. We’re not always sure what to do with it, or where to get the data we need, and this applies to recruiting as much as any field.AI technology can improve the odds of creating a great match — even right at the beginning of the process — by applying algorithms and making predictions that select only the most relevant jobs before showing them to job seekers.Let’s say a job description is unclear or contains gaps. Algorithms can step in to estimate salaries or classify unusual or eccentric job titles that nobody actually searches for (“Digital Overlord”, anyone?).Using natural language processing abilities, AI can also comb through what are often text-heavy and unstructured resumes to pinpoint critical information and paint a more accurate picture of the ideal job for a particular candidate.The result? Job seekers see the jobs they need to see, and are provided with the information essential to making an informed decision — meaning less wasted time and better matches for recruiter and job seeker alike.USING AI TO REDUCE UNCONSCIOUS BIASBut that’s not all. AI can also carry out a wide range of recruiting and HR-related tasks. Keeping the job seeker safe from scams and protecting personal data is an important requirement in today’s world. AI helps manage this process, using signals to identify and eliminate poor-quality sites, posts and scams.It can also help reduce human bias. Take the new technology of automated assessments, for example, which gives HR and recruiting professionals insight into how a candidate would perform certain job tasks.> Here’s an example of how it works: A large contact centre in the EU needed to source seven different languages in one location. Now typically, a recruiter might typically have that person speak with a language specialist as part of the application process.But doing evaluations with so many candidates and multiple different language specialists not only places a strain on resources, it also introduces a lot of subjectivity into the process.Instead, the employer used AI-powered language proficiency assessments. This may sound like science fiction but it isn’t: Each candidate had a 10-minute phone conversation with the AI agent in that assigned language. During those conversations, the AI technology automatically evaluated the candidates’ fluency and communications skills.The result? A far more efficient, less stressful process. Not bad for a cold, impersonal machine — and this is just the tip of the iceberg.LIBERATING EMPLOYERS TO FOCUS ON THE HUMAN SIDE OF HIRINGEven as AI continues to make significant advances, it is never going to replace human recruiters. Rather it will enhance and improve our work.The current capabilities rely on human beings to apply and use that technology and ensure that everything runs smoothly. But there’s more to it than that: no matter how advanced the technology gets, recruiting will remain a fundamentally human activity.When job seekers and employers interact with great recruiters, they build trust, loyalty and a sense of teamwork — and this cannot be replicated by machines. The role of AI is to free up more time for recruiters, so they can place more focus on the human relationships that make them great at what they do. AI may be able to beat us at a game of “Go” but it will never beat us at that.(Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of YourStory.)",,,,,,,,,,
