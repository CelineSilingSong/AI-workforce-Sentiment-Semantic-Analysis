AI is permeating a wide range of areas and it is bound to transform work and society. This series addresses possibilities and challenges. Above all it asks what needs to be done politically in order to shape this transformation for the sake of the common good.

AI and work
AI has conjured up a dystopia of robots displacing human workers from employment. Some have predicted very large-scale job substitution but others question whether such a predetermined outcome can be envisaged: whether jobs are lost and how they are changed depends on whether workers are involved in the decisions that are made. Similar concerns apply to issues of recruitment and monitoring of workers: will AI data serve a ‘surveillance capitalism’ or could it assist workers in the performance of their jobs if they have more power to influence the outcome?

AI and society
AI raises wider questions about the society in which we live and that of the future. Market-research institutes foresee huge efficiency gains, but are these credible and, if so, how will such gains be distributed? Feminists and anti-racists have expressed concern that the algorithms on which AI depends unconsciously embed the social prejudices of their human authors. Issues of privacy and civil liberty surround the possession and control of the data mined by AI. How education must change so that citizens can feel empowered rather than alienated by AI is also at stake—as is the ever-present issue of where AI fits in meeting the existential challenge of climate change and biodiversity loss.

Digital transformation: Artificial intelligence in the public sector

 April 16, 2020   



© Andranik Hakobyan | 





Here, we look at the digital transformation of government, focussing on the role of artificial intelligence in the public sector





Former Prime Minister of the UK, David Cameron, once remarked that: “I believe the creation of the Government Digital Service is one of the great unsung triumphs of the last Parliament.” Today, the role of the Government Digital Service (GDS) as part of the Cabinet Office concerns the digital transformation of government. On the GDS’s blog, they sum up what they are all about in their own words. “We’re a centre of excellence in digital, technology and data, collaborating with departments to help them with their own transformation. We work with them to build platforms, standards, and digital services.” (1)
Artificial intelligence in the public sector
Recently, the GDS has published joint guidance with the Office for Artificial Intelligence about how to use and build artificial intelligence (AI) in the public sector. (2)

In A guide to using artificial intelligence in the public sector, we learn that AI could change the way we live and work, for example, several public sector organisations use AI for tasks ranging from fraud detection to answering customer queries successfully today. While it is estimated that AI could contribute 5% of the UK’s GDP by 2030, ethical, fairness and safety considerations must be taken into account

The paper also gives a very useful definition of AI, that includes the following: “At its core, AI is a research field spanning philosophy, logic, statistics, computer science, mathematics, neuroscience, linguistics, cognitive psychology and economics

“AI can be defined as the use of digital technology to create systems capable of performing tasks commonly thought to require intelligence

“Machine learning is the most widely-used form of AI, and has contributed to innovations like self-driving cars, speech recognition and machine translation.”

One of the many case studies highlighted in the paper concerns the Department for International Development who partnered with Columbia University, the University of Southampton, and the United Nations Population Fund “to apply a random forest machine learning algorithm to satellite image and micro-census data.” Another is about how the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) uses AI to improve MOT testing.

The paper also draws our attention to the fact that AI can benefit the public sector, such as giving more accurate information, predictions and forecasts that result in better outcomes, more accurate medical diagnoses or automating repetitive and time-consuming tasks to free up the valuable time of frontline staff.

However, with an AI project, you need to consider several factors, including AI ethics and safety the paper urges, such as data quality, fairness, accountability, privacy, explainability and transparency, plus costs. The paper also notes that you need to ensure that your AI system is compliant with GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA 2018), including the points that concern automated decision making.

“Automated decisions in this context are decisions made without human intervention, which have legal or similarly significant effects on ‘data subjects’. For example, an online decision to award a business grant.

“If you want to use automated processes to make decisions with legal or similarly significant effects on individuals you must follow the safeguards laid out in the GDPR and DPA 2018.” (3)








Industrial Strategy
This article draws on a few highlights from the paper and it is well worth taking time to read the extensive information contained within.
The paper refers to the Industrial Strategy White Paper, which places AI and Data as one of four Grand Challenges, with support of up to £950 million in the AI Sector Deal.
In 2019, the then Digital Secretary, Jeremy Wright, provided his own thoughts on AI whilst underlining the innovation taking place in the UK’s ‘tech for good’ sector.
“Britain is already a leading authority in AI. We are home to some of the world’s finest academic institutions, landing record levels of investment to the sector and attracting the best global tech talent, but we must not be complacent.
“Through our AI Council we will continue this momentum by leveraging the knowledge of experts from a range of sectors to provide leadership on the best use and adoption of artificial intelligence across the economy.” (4)
GDS: Working hard to make their services work better
In closing, it was recently highlighted on the website of GDS that they are working hard to make “services work


better for their users”. During recent years, we learn that hundreds of services went through user-centred digital transformation and as such, now meet GDS’s Service Standard. The GDS supply more detail about this in their own words as this article about the digital transformation of government is near the end.
“Thousands of user-centred design specialists are working alongside digital, policy, and operations professionals to make services less complex, easier to understand, and simpler to use.” (5)
This fits in really well with the new legal regulations that oblige public sector bodies to make websites and apps accessible. (6)

He holds a bachelor's degree in Writing, Literature, and Publishing from Emerson College. Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email  Barclays is a UK bank ranked 20th on S&P Global’s list of the top 100 banks. Like other top banks, Barclays has forayed into AI for a variety of use-cases. The bank seems to work with AI vendors more than it builds AI applications in-house, which aligns with the general trend of AI adoption in financial services: 68% of the AI products we researched as part of our AI Opportunity Landscape research in financial services were bought from vendors. Our deeper analysis of AI at the top global banks and financial institutions, including banks like Citi and HSBC, can easily be discovered with Emerj Plus. The Emerj Plus matrix view allows members to quickly discover what top players in their industry are doing with artificial intelligence and which AI applications are driving the highest ROI across key areas in their industry. In this article, we discuss three of Barclays’ AI initiatives in particular, as well as the AI vendors the bank claims to have worked with: Risk Modeling with Simudyne: Predictive analytics for analyzing the risk of lending to a loan applicant. Voice Recognition for Authentication with Nuance: Natural language processing-enabled identity verification and authentication via voice recognition. Business Process Automation with IBM: Automated debit and credit card deactivation and customer feedback analysis. We begin our analysis of Barclays’ AI initiatives with their “agent-based” modeling software, which they built with help from Simudyne. Agent-Based Modeling – Simudyne In July of 2019, Barclays announced a partnership with the AI startup Simudyne, which specializes in what the company calls “agent-based modelling.” This can be understood as the simulation of various banking situations using transactional data to build simulated customers within a bank’s ecosystem. This purportedly allows Barclays to simulate the banking and loan markets to produce detailed predictions.  Barclays claims that adopting Simudyne’s software helped them provide more robust offerings for their customers, such as new financial services.  This is likely because the software allows the client to develop a thorough understanding of the possibilities and risks associated with lending to a given customer or making a given investment. In addition to gauging the risk associated with individual customers, Barclays employees can purportedly use Simudyne’s solution to: Analyze mortgages: Simulate a relationship between customers and lenders by modeling housing and lending markets in conjunction with customer behaviors. Stress Test: Users can scale up their simulation to represent a greater portion of the market, or scale it down to show granular details about specific situations. The user can test how accurate their simulation is by continually scaling it up until the system cannot populate any more results. Contagion Risk: Create risk simulations in order to identify new investment risks and better understand how risky investment can lead to more precarious situations such as low liquidity. Simudyne’s agent-based modelling software most likely runs on predictive analytics, an AI approach for making predictions based on historical data. For example, the bank can choose to see what might happen if they chose to lend to three customers with varying credit scores. When running this simulation, they can choose how much mock-data should be attached to each simulated customer.  This mock data can include information from past investments and loan applications. The software could then purportedly determine how likely each customer is to pay back their loan in full.  The bank can also purportedly create a simulation of their investment applicants’ relationship to each other as well as other banks. Customers are organized according to the interactions and relationships they have with banks, credit unions, and other entities such as the IRS. The ML algorithm uses these factors to score customers on how likely they are to see profit from the investment or to pay their loan back.  Barclays also claims to run Simudyne’s solution through the cloud, which allows them to create simulations that encompass an even wider subset of data. This is because Barclays can now access all of their enterprise data from any of their data science labs. This means they can likely simulate large shifts in banking trends and begin preparing for the changes most likely to happen ahead of time.  For example, Barclays could see an influx of underserved loan applications over a short period of time. The bank’s risk managers could then run an agent-based simulation when trying to decide which of the applicants to lend to. This might show that nearly half of the applicants are indebted to other entities, and so are less likely to fully repay their loan with Barclays.  Voice Recognition for Authentication – Nuance Barclays also adopted a voice recognition solution from Nuance Communications to authenticate and verify its customers identities. Nuance refers to this capability as “voice biometrics,” and it runs on natural language processing (NLP) technology.  The bank claims its customer service agents are able to automatically detect if they are actually talking to who the customer claims to be or someone else and refuse access to those who do not pass authentication. Nuance claims that their clients’ users can see the following benefits when using voice biometrics: Improved customer experience: Customers may have less need to remember a password or PIN if they can be recognized with their voice. Enhanced security: Fraud rates may decrease in frequency when authentication is unique to every individual as opposed to based on security questions that are easily compromised.  Nuance claims the software detects the customer’s voice and authenticates it during the beginning of a customer service call without interrupting the call. If the software detects that the caller is not who they say they are, the customer service agent can choose to deny them access to personal information.  At this point, the agent may also be able to ask the customer to verify their identity through a password or PIN in order to continue receiving service. The following video from Nuance explains how their biometric authentication capability works:  Nuance lists a case study on their website detailing Barclays’ success with its software. Barclays conducted client research and purportedly found that their customers were looking for a better user experience within the telephone channel security process. Additionally, the bank’s client service center relationship managers spoke up about how it is uncomfortable to ask their clients a comprehensive set of security quests after establishing a good rapport with them.  After implementing the voice biometrics solution from Nuance, Barclays saw a 90% reduction in complaints about the security service. They also saw a 15% reduction in average call times, allowing them to field more client queries in less time. Business Process Automation – IBM Barclays also adopted two solutions from IBM: Business Process Manager and Blueworks Live, a cloud-based storage system for documenting customer journeys as data. Using Business Process Manager and Blueworks Live in conjunction, Barclays employees can purportedly: Access customer journeys globally and determine how well a customer’s needs were satisfied. Allow customers to receive SMS messages about attempted fraud with their account, which puts them in control of how they want to manage their funds should they be compromised. Process customer service reports such as lost or stolen credit cards and possible identity theft. The video below explains how Blueworks Live works:  IBM provides a case study which explains Barclays’ success with both the IBM Business Process Manager and Blueworks Live. The case study states that the solution helped Barclays gain a better understanding of how it documented customer journeys within the enterprise, how well they control them, and how customers feel about them.  The bank was purportedly able to take in reports of missing or compromised cards and replace them 67% faster. Additionally, they could also iterate on customer processes and roll out new ones 88% faster.  Emerj for Financial Services Leaders Leaders at large financial institutions use Emerj AI Opportunity Landscapes to discover how their competitors are leveraging AI to drive value in key areas like customer service and fraud.

Until last year, if you had checked into the Henn na Hotel in Japan you’d have had a staff of 243 robots at your disposal. From the nodding velociraptor and humanoid “manning” the front desk, to the recycling bin droid that roamed the corridors and the chatty in-room artificial intelligence (AI) concierge, the world’s first robot hotel even had mechanised fish swimming around a tank in the lobby.
The world’s first robot-staffed hotel
The Henn na, which loosely translates as “strange”, opened in Nagasaki in 2015 with a whirlwind of publicity. It was seen as a template for the future. A robot-staffed hotel could offer a fun and original experience for guests, while providing huge savings on staff costs for hotel owners.
“From an operational costs point of view, it was quite a brilliant thing,” says Dr Nick Naumov, senior lecturer in tourism and hospitality management at the University of Northampton and visiting professor at Meikai University in Tokyo Bay, who specialises in how AI and robots affect service quality in hotels.
“They started off employing 30 human staff for 140 rooms, which could be 300 guests. And when things went well initially, they brought that down to seven staff, which is a really good ratio.”
The in-room voice assistant would confuse snoring with a command and issue a response that would wake guests up
That this robot hotel originated in Japan, a nation which exports more industrial robots than any other and has long been ahead of the curve in robotics technology and innovation, chimed with the narrative perfectly.
Shortly after its opening, Henn na’s owner Hideo Sawada cited the country’s love of anime and manga robots as inspiration for the hotel. He went on to predict: “In five to ten years, this kind of robot hotel will spread all over the world.”
The company did open another hotel, at Urayasu in Tokyo Bay, and at one point had another eight robot hotels in the pipeline. But these plans never materialised and in January 2019 Henn na cut more than half its robot workforce.
Strange Hotel rings robot staff redundancies
At first guests had loved the novelty of the robot hotel experience and the colour it brought to their social feeds, but before long things started to go wrong. The robotic dinosaur and humanoid on the front desk could only speak one language each, English and Japanese respectively.
Later Mandarin and Korean were added, but that still left many guests wrestling to be understood, including a Scottish man, who documented his experience on YouTube. The robots also struggled with the different passport and identity-card formats and photocopying the documentation, so human staff constantly had to step in.
Guests grew frustrated with the in-room voice assistant called Churi. It could cope with basic commands, such as turning the lights on and off, but appeared primitive when asked more sophisticated queries, such as flight schedules or theme park opening times by guests accustomed to voice AI at a level offered by Google Home, Alexa and Siri. Churi would also confuse snoring as a voice command and issue a perky response that would wake guests up.
The hotel had to raise its staff count to deal with the escalating complaints, plus the robots themselves required an increasing amount of expensive maintenance. As Naumov says: “Just like any other tech, they needed regular servicing and constant software updates, and those things aren’t cheap.”
According to one hotel guest, following a visit in 2016: “About half the puppy-size lobby dancers appeared to be broken or in need of charging.” And after the hotel cut its robot workforce, a long-time staff member was quoted as saying: “It’s easier now that we’re not being frequently called by guests to help with problems with the robots.”
Imagining a future for robot staff and AI in the hotel industry
It’s not a question of whether customer service AI is valuable in a hotel setting, as it clearly is. But according to Dr Björn Schuller, professor of AI at Imperial College London, whose expertise includes affective computing, or the science of AI and emotion, what happened at Henn na Hotel reminds us to think about which applications AI is suitable for and which it isn’t: tech realism over tech optimism.
“Where a bot is most useful is not in place of a social context, but when you want precise information in as short a time as possible or to save you waiting for something,” he says.
Some of the most successful robots in hotels do just that, for example Hilton’s Connie, which employs IBM’s Watson AI software to provide personalised information about visitor attractions, restaurant recommendations and direct guests around the hotel. While other big-name hotel chains, such as the Marriott and Yotel, use robot butlers for speedy, but rudimentary, room service requests, such as fetching a towel, coffee or sandwich.
By using robots for room service and other entry-level tasks, such as cleaning and luggage transportation, which were both done by robots at Henn na, Naumov points out you improve efficiency, but also free up the human staff to welcome guests, handle complaints and deal with other crucial customer service needs.
“The human touch will never disappear,” he says, adding that human-centred service may become “the new currency of luxury hospitality in the future”. This could mean low-cost hotels running largely on service automation, robotics and AI with a skeleton staff, while expensive hotels retain a large, visible human workforce.
What’s the right kind of robot for a robot hotel?
There is also the question of trust. We might believe a human concierge is giving us the inside scoop on the best local restaurants or places to withdraw cash with a good rate, even if they’re not, but a robot would always put the hotel’s agenda first.
As Schuller says: “In the future a robot will always give you better information than a human, as they won’t forget things and they’ll be fully updated with the latest news, but then it becomes a matter of trust. A human can pretend they’re doing you a favour, even risking their job to do so, but we know a robot will always be on the company’s side.”
Unlike robot hotel Henn na’s front-desk humanoid, the Hilton and Marriott droids all look like typical robots, as imagined in 1980s films and TV, as opposed to human-like iterations, which some people find disquieting. In a low-cost hotel, we might not mind an unmanned check-in desk with facial recognition sensors, or to use our mobile phone as a room key, if it saves us time and money.
But to have a humanoid overseeing that function adds a layer of alienation to the experience that we might not have noticed otherwise.
However, the right kind of robot can become a star attraction. This happened in Belgium at Ghent, when Mario from the Marriott became a minor celebrity, visiting local schools, football clubs and even giving speeches at welcome and farewell events.
And with conversational AI set to get smarter and even more “charismatic”, according to Schuller, over the next few years hotels may be able to capitalise on this through creation of celebrity AI to attract guests and which could be combined with robotics technology.
As Schuller adds: “Once we have natives of socially and emotionally intelligent AI, this digitally advanced generation of consumers could have a whole different level of perception. Maybe they’d seek out AI with different personality attributes, famous AI for example, to give them kudos.” Just as long as the AI can spot the difference between snoring and talking.

Artificial intelligence is among the many hot technologies that promise to change the face of warfare for years to come. Articles abound that describe its possibilities and warn those who fall behind in the AI race. The Department of Defense has duly created the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center in the hopes of winning the AI battle. Visions exist of AI enabling autonomous systems to conduct missions, achieving sensor fusion, automating tasks, and making better, quicker decisions than humans. AI is improving rapidly and some day in the future those goals may be achieved. In the meantime, AI’s impact will be in the more mundane, dull, and monotonous tasks performed by our military in uncontested environments.
Artificial intelligence is a rapidly developing capability. Extensive research by academia and industry is resulting in shorter training time for systems and increasingly better results. AI is effective at certain tasks, such as image recognition, recommendation systems, and language translation. Many systems designed for these tasks are fielded today and producing very good results. In other areas, AI is very short of human-level achievement. Some of these areas include working with scenarios not seen previously by the AI; understanding the context of text (understanding sarcasm, for example) and objects; and multi-tasking (i.e., being able to solve problems of multiple type). Most AI systems today are trained to do one task, and to do so only under very specific circumstances. Unlike humans, they do not adapt well to new environments and new tasks.
Artificial-intelligence models are improving daily and have shown their value in many applications. The performance of these systems can make them very useful for tasks such as identifying a T-90 main battle tank in a satellite image, identifying high-value targets in a crowd using facial recognition, translating text for open-source intelligence, and text generation for use in information operations. The application areas where AI has been most successful are those where there are large quantities of labelled data, like Imagenet, Google Translate, and text generation. AI is also very capable in areas like recommendation systems, anomaly detection, prediction systems, and competitive games. An AI system in these domains could assist the military with fraud detection in its contracting services, predicting when weapons systems will fail due to maintenance issues, or developing winning strategies in conflict simulations. All of these applications and more can be force multipliers in day-to-day operations and in the next conflict.
AI’s Shortfalls for Military Applications
As the military looks to incorporate AI’s success in these tasks into its systems, some challenges must be acknowledged. The first is that developers need access to data. Many AI systems are trained using data that has been labeled by some expert system (e.g., labeling scenes that include an air defense battery), usually a human. Large datasets are often labeled by companies who employ manual methods. Obtaining this data and sharing it is a challenge, especially for an organization that prefers to classify data and restrict access to it. An example military dataset may be one with images produced by thermal-imaging systems and labeled by experts to describe the weapon systems found in the image, if any. Without sharing this with preprocessors and developers, an AI that uses that set effectively cannot be created. AI systems are also vulnerable to becoming very large (and thus slow), and consequently susceptible to “dimensionality issues.” For example, training a system to recognize images of every possible weapon system in existence would involve thousands of categories. Such systems will require an enormous amount of computing power and lots of dedicated time on those resources. And because we are training a model, the best model requires an infinite amount of these images to be completely accurate. That is something we cannot achieve. Furthermore, as we train these AI systems, we often attempt to force them to follow “human” rules such as the rules of grammar. However, humans often ignore these rules, which makes developing successful AI systems for things like sentiment analysis and speech recognition challenging. Finally, AI systems can work well in uncontested, controlled domains. However, research is demonstrating that under adversarial conditions, AI systems can easily be fooled, resulting in errors. Certainly, many DoD AI applications will operate in contested spaces, like the cyber domain, and thus, we should be wary of their results.
Ignoring the enemy’s efforts to defeat the AI systems that we may employ, there are limitations to these seemingly super-human models. An AI’s image-processing capability is not very robust when given images that are different from its training set—for example, images where lighting conditions are poor, that are at an obtuse angle, or that are partially obscured. Unless these types of images were in the training set, the model may struggle (or fail) to accurately identify the content. Chat bots that might aid our information-operations missions are limited to hundreds of words and thus cannot completely replace a human who can write pages at a time. Prediction systems, such as IBM’s Watson weather-prediction tool, struggle with dimensionality issues and the availability of input data due to the complexity of the systems they are trying to model. Research may solve some of these problems but few of them will be solved as quickly as predicted or desired.
Another simple weakness with AI systems is their inability to multi-task. A human is capable of identifying an enemy vehicle, deciding a weapon system to employ against it, predicting its path, and then engaging the target. This fairly simple set of tasks is currently impossible for an AI system to accomplish. At best, a combination of AIs could be constructed where individual tasks are given to separate models. That type of solution, even if feasible, would entail a huge cost in sensing and computing power not to mention the training and testing of the system. Many AI systems are not even capable of transferring their learning within the same domain. For example, a system trained to identify a T-90 tank would most likely be unable to identify a Chinese Type 99 tank, despite the fact that they are both tanks and both tasks are image recognition. Many researchers are working to enable systems to transfer their learning, but such systems are years away from production.
Artificial-intelligence systems are also very poor at understanding inputs and context within the inputs. AI recognition systems don’t understand what the image is, they simply learn textures and gradients of the image’s pixels. Given scenes with those same gradients, AIs readily identify portions of the picture incorrectly. This lack of understanding can result in misclassifications that humans would not make, such as identifying a boat on a lake as a BMP.
This leads to another weakness of these systems—the inability to explain how they made their decisions. Most of what occurs inside an AI system is a black box and there is very little that a human can do to understand how the system makes its decisions. This is a critical problem for high-risk systems such as those that make engagement decisions or whose output may be used in critical decision-making processes. The ability to audit a system and learn why it made a mistake is legally and morally important. Additionally, issues on how we assess liability in cases where AI is involved are open research concerns. There have been many examples in the news recently of AI systems making poor decisions based on hidden biases in areas such as loan approvals and parole determinations. Unfortunately, work on explainable AI is many years from bearing fruit.
AI systems also struggle to distinguish between correlation and causation. The infamous example often used to illustrate the difference is the correlation between drowning deaths and ice cream sales. An AI system fed with statistics about these two items would not know that the two patterns only correlate because both are a function of warmer weather and might conclude that to prevent drowning deaths we should restrict ice cream sales. This type of problem could manifest itself in a military fraud prevention system that is fed data on purchases by month. Such a system could errantly conclude that fraud increases in September as spending increases when really it’s just a function of end-of-year spending habits.
Even without these AI weaknesses, the main area the military should be concerned with at the moment is adversarial attacks. We must assume that potential adversaries will attempt to fool or break any accessible AI systems that we use. Attempts will be made to fool image-recognition engines and sensors; cyberattacks will try to evade intrusion-detection systems; and logistical systems will be fed altered data to clog the supply lines with false requirements.
Adversarial attacks can be separated into four categories: evasion, inference, poisoning, and extraction. It has been shown that these types of attacks are easy to accomplish and often don’t require computing skills. Evasion attacks attempt to fool an AI engine often in the hopes of avoiding detection—hiding a cyberattack, for example, or convincing a sensor that a tank is a school bus. The primary survival skill of the future may be the ability to hide from AI sensors. As a result, the military may need to develop a new type of AI camouflage to defeat AI systems because it’s been shown that simple obfuscation techniques such as strategic tape placement can fool AI. Evasion attacks are often proceeded by inference attacks that gain information about the AI system that can be used to enable evasion attacks. Poisoning attacks target AI systems during training to achieve their malicious intent. Here the threat would be enemy access to the datasets used to train our tools. Mislabeled images of vehicles to fool targeting systems or manipulated maintenance data designed to classify imminent system failure as normal operation may be inserted. Given the vulnerabilities of our supply chains, this would not be unimaginable and would be difficult to detect. Extraction attacks exploit access to the AI’s interface to learn enough about the AI’s operation to create a parallel model of the system. If our AIs are not secure from unauthorized users, then those users could predict decisions made by our systems and use those predictions to their advantage. One could envision an opponent predicting how an AI-controlled unmanned system will respond to certain visual and electromagnetic stimuli and thus influence its route and behavior.
The Path Forward for Military AI Usage
Artificial intelligence will certainly have a role in future military applications. It has many application areas where it will enhance productivity, reduce user workload, and operate more quickly than humans. Ongoing research will continue to improve its capability, explainability, and resilience. The military cannot ignore this technology. Even if we do not embrace it, certainly our opponents will, and we must be able to attack and defeat their AIs. However, we must resist the allure of this resurgent technology. Placing vulnerable AI systems in contested domains and making them responsible for critical decisions opens the opportunity for disastrous results. At this time, humans must remain responsible for key decisions.
Given the high probability that our exposed AI systems will be attacked and the current lack of resilience in AI technology, the best areas to invest in military AI are those that operate in uncontested domains. Artificial-intelligence tools that are closely supervised by human experts or that have secure inputs and outputs can provide value to the military while alleviating concerns about vulnerabilities. Examples of such systems are medical-imaging diagnostic tools, maintenance-failure prediction applications, and fraud-detection programs. All of these can provide value to the military while limiting the risk from adversarial attacks, biased data, context misunderstanding, and more. These are not the super tools sponsored by the AI salesmen of the world but are the ones most likely to have success in the near term.

AI might seem neutral and technical but it poses a differential challenge to female jobs and can be imbued with insidious gender biases.
Juliane Bir
Digitalisation is encroaching further and further into all our lives in ways of which we are scarcely aware. Algorithms and artificial intelligence guide a vast range of society’s choices and opportunities.
Trade unions are alarmed that AI poses a threat to gender equality, by undermining women’s job opportunities and reinforcing stereotypes in the workplace and society, incorporating biases and prejudices into algorithms and programmes. The European Trade Union Confederation is calling for tough measures to ensure women are not second-class citizens in the digital revolution.
There are two main areas of concern, covering women’s jobs and the wider impact of algorithms on their lives.

Challenging for women
Recent research for the International Monetary Fund finds greater automation will be especially challenging for women in the labour market. Hard-won progress towards improving the place of women in the workforce and winning equal pay may be quickly eroded if they work predominantly in sectors and occupations likely to be automated.
The IMF estimates that 26 million women’s jobs in 30 countries (mainly members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development), have at least a 70 per cent risk of being replaced by technology within the next 20 years. Around 11 per cent of female workers could lose their jobs, compared with 9 per cent of men.
Older women and those in low-skilled clerical, service and sales positions are most likely to be affected. There is a danger too that employers will use the threat of automation to further force down wages and working conditions, compelling workers to compete in a race to the bottom they cannot win.

At the same time, women are under-represented in expanding fields in science, technology, engineering and mathematics—the so-called STEM disciplines—where cultural and social influences have contributed to their exclusion. Globally, women make up 36 per cent of STEM university graduates, yet only 25 per cent of STEM workers (see figure) and just 9 per cent of the decision-makers.

According to the IMF, much more needs to be done to boost women’s STEM skills and bridge the digital gender divide, by investment in access and infrastructure, and to close gender gaps in leadership positions and facilitate career progression. For example, attention is needed to childcare and working-time arrangements, as also to the needs of older and low-skilled female workers.
Biased systems
The shortage of female AI professionals carries a further risk—that the digital future will be made by men for men. Biased systems based on flawed data can now influence who gets a job interview or a loan, a promotion or a pay rise. If the people creating the algorithms do not reflect the world’s diverse population, that is a problem, and more female coders, inventors and investors are needed to develop innovations that cater to female needs.
Because existing algorithms tend to treat men as the default and women as atypical, bias and discrimination are in danger of becoming the norm. Women pay the price in time and money—even with their lives. For example, women and men show different symptoms for heart attack, but systems based on male experiences mean that women’s conditions may be incorrectly diagnosed.
There are numerous examples of AI systems behaving badly. Reuters revealed that after Amazon had spent years working on an automated recruitment system it realised that women were being excluded from software developer and other technical posts. Amazon’s computer models used data submitted over the previous ten years, most of it coming from men and reflecting male dominance in the tech industry. In effect, Amazon’s system taught itself to select male candidates and mark down curricula vitae that included the word ‘women’s’—including graduates from some women’s colleges.
Last year Apple faced allegations that its new credit card offered lower credit limits to women than men. Similar problems have dogged Google, IBM and Microsoft AI systems.
In facial-analysis programmes, some algorithms find men’s faces easier to identify than women’s, especially if they are dark-skinned—the computer scientist Joy Buolamwini discovered this discrimination through personal experience. Another headline-grabbing example came from a recent UNESCO report, which found female-gendered voice assistants, such as Alexa, reinforced stereotypes through their submissive, servile responses.
Growing injustice
The use of AI requires ethical and legal frameworks that will counter the risks of gender bias. Without regulation, society will reap the harvest of growing injustice.
All workers need to become ‘AI literate’—understanding its impact and anticipating how it will transform their roles, being able to process and manipulate data and to identify and solve problems. This requires a joint effort, with school systems backed up by employers, being sure to include women, minorities and older people and including AI literacy in negotiations with trade unions.
The digital age should eradicate inequalities at the workplace and bring better-quality jobs and healthier working conditions for all. It should anticipate skills needs and launch reskilling and upskilling programmes as an investment in the future, not a perceived cost. Workers and trade unions should be involved in planning all moves towards digitalisation.
Change in governance
The ETUC insists that AI should be designed to improve the quality of life, safety and prosperity of all Europeans citizens, including women. This requires a change in governance, to involve workers and trade unions in planning, investment and control of technology.
Workers and their unions should be informed and consulted and should participate in the whole process of implementing AI systems, with a guaranteed ‘right of explanation’ when AI is used in recruitment, promotion or dismissal procedures, and a right to appeal against decisions. Facial recognition and tools to monitor performance present risks to women workers in particular and should only be employed with adequate safeguards guaranteed in collective agreements. Workers should have the right to access, and to manage, their own AI-generated personal data.
Tech companies should recruit more women and education systems should encourage more women into STEM subjects. Human beings must have the right to supervise and control AI systems and this must be established as a fundamental legal and ethical principle for the regulation of robotics and artificial intelligence, including in the world of work.
Ultimately, companies can gain a competitive advantage by developing and using AI systems that are trustworthy, ethically and socially responsible, and which respect European values, gender equality and labour rights.

Google Engineers 'Mutate' AI to Make It Evolve Systems Faster Than We Can Code Them

Tech17 April 2020By David Nield

Much of the work undertaken by artificial intelligence involves a training process known as machine learning, where AI gets better at a task such as recognising a cat or mapping a route the more it does it. Now that same technique is being use to create new AI systems, without any human intervention.



For years, engineers at Google have been working on a freakishly smart machine learning system known as the AutoML system (or automatic machine learning system), which is already capable of creating AI that outperforms anything we've made.



Now, researchers have tweaked it to incorporate concepts of Darwinian evolution and shown it can build AI programs that continue to improve upon themselves faster than they would if humans were doing the coding.



The new system is called AutoML-Zero, and although it may sound a little alarming, it could lead to the rapid development of smarter systems - for example, neural networked designed to more accurately mimic the human brain with multiple layers and weightings, something human coders have struggled with.



""It is possible today to automatically discover complete machine learning algorithms just using basic mathematical operations as building blocks,"" write the researchers in their pre-print paper. ""We demonstrate this by introducing a novel framework that significantly reduces human bias through a generic search space.""



The original AutoML system is intended to make it easier for apps to leverage machine learning, and already includes plenty of automated features itself, but AutoML-Zero takes the required amount of human input way down.



Using a simple three-step process - setup, predict and learn - it can be thought of as machine learning from scratch.



The system starts off with a selection of 100 algorithms made by randomly combining simple mathematical operations. A sophisticated trial-and-error process then identifies the best performers, which are retained - with some tweaks - for another round of trials. In other words, the neural network is mutating as it goes.



When new code is produced, it's tested on AI tasks - like spotting the difference between a picture of a truck and a picture of a dog - and the best-performing algorithms are then kept for future iteration. Like survival of the fittest.



And it's fast too: the researchers reckon up to 10,000 possible algorithms can be searched through per second per processor (the more computer processors available for the task, the quicker it can work).



Eventually, this should see artificial intelligence systems become more widely used, and easier to access for programmers with no AI expertise. It might even help us eradicate human bias from AI, because humans are barely involved.



Work to improve AutoML-Zero continues, with the hope that it'll eventually be able to spit out algorithms that mere human programmers would never have thought of. Right now it's only capable of producing simple AI systems, but the researchers think the complexity can be scaled up rather rapidly.



""While most people were taking baby steps, [the researchers] took a giant leap into the unknown,"" computer scientist Risto Miikkulainen from the University of Texas, Austin, who was not involved in the work, told Edd Gent at Science. ""This is one of those papers that could launch a lot of future research.""The research paper has yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, but can be viewed online at arXiv.org.

Artificial Intelligence is transforming how we design and build. By 2050, the effects of AI adoption will be widely felt across all aspects of our daily lives. As the world faces a number of urgent and complex challenges, from the climate crisis to housing, AI has the potential to make the difference between a dystopian future and a livable one. By looking ahead, we’re taking stock of what’s happening, and in turn, imagining how AI can shape our lives for the better.

Artificial intelligence is broadly defined as the theory and development of computer systems to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. The term is often applied to a machine or system’s ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. Today, AI already utilizes algorithms to suggest what we should see, read, and listen to, and these systems have extended to everyday tasks like suggested travel routes, autonomous flying, optimized farming, and warehousing and logistic supply chains. Even if we are not aware of it, we are already feeling the effects of AI adoption.
As Alex Hern explored at The Guardian, making predictions on the next 30 years is a mug’s game. However, the act of following trend-lines to possible conclusions and imagining how we might live is a productive exercise. We’re taking a closer look at how artificial intelligence will shape design by 2050. From air taxis and urban intelligence to construction and the Singularity, AI will continue to shape how we live, work and play.
The Future of Work
According to The Economist, 47% of the work done by humans will have been replaced by robots by 2037, even those traditionally associated with university education. These jobs will be lost as “artificial intelligence, robotics, nanotechnology and other socio-economic factors replace the need for human employees.” Editorial Data & Content Manager Nicolás Valencia explored this idea two years ago and how automation will affect architects. The conclusion is that the most difficult jobs to replace require a high level of creativity and human interaction, and have a low percentage of repetitive activities. These will be the last to be replaced, but there will also be new jobs created that will become necessary to monitor and coordinate intelligent machines and systems.
As we approach a time when the broad intelligence of AI exceeds human levels, existential questions arise. What should you study when any job can be programmed or replaced? Will universal income be adopted as a result? Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates believes so. “AI is just the latest in technologies that allow us to produce a lot more goods and services with less labor,” says Gates. How we work, and what we can work on, will begin to change at an increasingly faster rate. If half of all work can be done by robots or machines in the next 15 years, it’s likely that all work will be shaped by AI before 2050.
Urban Intelligence & Big Data
AI and the “Internet of Things” are changing how we live, and in turn, society at large. Architect Bettina Zerza has explored how data and intelligent systems will dramatically shape our cities. She gives the example of micro sensors and urban technology that will record air quality, noise pollution and soundscapes, as well as urban infrastructure at large. How people move, where emissions are worst, and how efficient city processes are represent just a few of these ideas.
Today, 55% of the world’s population lives in urban areas, a number that will increase to 70% by 2050. Projections show that urbanization could add another 2.5 billion people to urban areas by 2050, with close to 90% of this increase taking place in Asia and Africa. Here, AI can further analyze and monitor how we move about the city, work together, and unwind. In 30 years, we will also have entirely new versions of these modalities.
Transportation
How we move is already undergoing widespread transformation. Transit is being reimagined on the street and in the air, from public transit transforming to more user-centric mobility services, to rethinking regulatory and organizational structures. Looking at the evolution of transportation, there have been new innovations and shifts in the status quo every 50 to 70 years throughout the last two centuries. From ships and trains to automobiles and airplanes, these advances have changed the way we communicate, trade and connect to one another.
Today, there is a lot of talk about the Hyperloop systems, with Virgin Hyperloop One and HyperloopTT emerging as the leading teams rethinking transportation. The implications for 2050 are dramatic, where our current ideas and associations of cities, geography and resources will radically change. At the same time, companies like Uber and Volocopter are looking to the sky to design and develop the world’s first vertiport and air taxi hubs around the world. Trying to anticipate the future of mobility, the Third Dimension will open up new possibilities for transit.
Construction
Construction has been one of the most challenging sectors for artificial intelligence. British multinational infrastructure company Balfour Beatty published their predictions for 2050 in their Innovation Paper. The report outlines a series of conclusions: robots will work in teams to build complex structures using dynamic new materials, while elements of a build will self-assemble. Drones flying overhead will scan the site, sending instructions to robotic cranes and diggers and automated builders with no need for human involvement. The result is a human-free construction process, one where the role of the builder moves to “overseer” and they are remotely managing projects.
Moreover, if people are still on site before being phased out, they will be using robotically enhanced exoskeletons and neural-control technology to move and control machinery and other robots on site. These movements could eventually address the dangers of construction and make Zero Harm a reality. However, there are deeper ideological changes that come with human-free building. In terms of design and an appreciation for craft, we may begin to lose a “human touch” and the haptic qualities of construction. It is directly tied to the very meaning of tectonics; the science and art of construction, the activity of building, and the resulting details and connections.
The Singularity
Looking to the future, especially as far as 2050, there is a lot of discussion about the “singularity” moment in artificial intelligence. The Singularity is often defined as the point at which exponential technological advancements cross the threshold of “strong AI” and machines possess a broad intelligence that exceeds human levels. There is a very strong chance it will happen by 2050.
The singularity also represents a point where human intelligence and AI merge. Human intelligence will undergo an extensive integration with AI, forming a symbiotic relationship where AIs are empowered by human talent for creative and lateral thinking. At the same time, humans could be empowered by AI’s memory and rapid computing. The design implications are, quite definitively, hard to grasp. To put it another way, we may begin to create designs we don’t yet have the capacity to imagine.
Artificial intelligence will continue to inspire discussions on the precarity of work, our shared ethics, ideas like universal basic income and urban intelligence, as well as how we design. More than productivity gains, we can rethink the way we live and how we shape the built environment. By doing so, we can being to imagine new creative and social processes, and hopefully, work with AI to lay the foundation for a better future.

Artificial intelligence is often associated with prophecies of job destruction. Yet an army of workers in the global south is being pressed into action.
Mark Graham
In discussions about the locations comprising the key productive nodes of artificial intelligence and other next-generation digital technologies, African workers rarely get a mention. Autonomous vehicles, machine-learning systems, next-generation search engines and recommendations systems—how many of these technologies are ‘made in Africa’? The answer, actually, is ‘all of them’.
In a paper from which this article is derived, we make visible the invisible and bring to light the role African workers are playing in developing such key emergent, and everyday, technologies—which underpin, or soon will, the enormous profits made by large technology companies based in the global north. In the context of hyperbolic claims about automation and robotisation—and the impending technological unemployment they are predicted to herald—human labour, including that of African workers, remains very much a part of contemporary digital capitalism.

Production networks
We conducted a five-year study (2014-19) in South Africa, Ghana, Nigeria, Uganda and Kenya, involving in-depth interviews and group discussions with more than 200 stakeholders—including workers, managers of outsourcing firms, government officials, trade unions, employment agencies, private-sector associations and industry experts. This enabled us to construct a snapshot of the key ways in which African digital labour has been integrated into the production networks of digital products and services being deployed around the world.
We focused on machine learning and digital decision-making. These activities are performed by workers employed within firms or operating as freelancers through digital work platforms (such as Upwork, Freelancer.com and Amazon Mechanical Turk), which act as intermediaries between employers and workers in a planetary labour market. Much hides behind the sleek, automated surfaces.
African workers play an important role in building and maintaining these technologies—acting as ‘data janitors’. Real people are still needed to structure, classify and tag an enormous amount of unstructured information for companies using machine-learning algorithms in their products.

While many scholars are predicting that machines will replace humans in the production process, thus increasing unemployment around the world, automation is not always what it seems. Technological advances and use of machines in production can destroy jobs in one location (primarily richer regions), yet can also open up many lower-income work possibilities for workers in poorer countries.
Once we acknowledge that many contemporary digital technologies rely on a lot of human labour to drive their interfaces, we can begin to piece together what the new global division of labour for digital work looks like. We need detailed empirical studies of where value is created and captured in these production networks, which are opaque by design. Research can start to make the invisible nodes of these chains more visible and highlight the pay and working conditions of the workers who make everything possible.
This is not to say that many of these digital workers are poorly paid by local standards, or that they are ungrateful for their jobs. But high unemployment and a large informal sector mean these digital jobs receive overly positive reviews, while the risks are sidelined. And digital workers in Africa are still earning only a tiny fraction of the profits generated from their labour.
Socio-political response
The contemporary digital economy thus offers jobs and opportunities to African workers, but even more of an opportunity to the international corporations which seek to profit from their labour. There is no easy means for firms and individuals based in the world’s economic margins to move up global value chains, but this does not mean that we should throw up our hands and accept the status quo.
As digital connectivity spreads to the last corners of the world, we hope this knowledge will help build a greater socio-political response to the relatively labour-intensive nature of the contemporary digital economy, in which African workers play a significant role in value creation. Once we acknowledge that many contemporary digital technologies rely on a lot of human labour to drive their interfaces, we can begin to piece together what the new global division of labour for digital work looks like and aim—at both the global and local scales—to make some of these value chains more transparent, ethical, and rewarding.
Meantime, there is still much to be done to understand better African digital labour, to challenge labour processes and employment relations, to improve the quality of work and to identify the common interests of workers—and the ways their labour connects distant sites of production and consumption.
