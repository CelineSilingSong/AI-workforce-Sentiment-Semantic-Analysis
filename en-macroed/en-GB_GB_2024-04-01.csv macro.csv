AI in the workplace: beware the risks and seize the opportunities, says Ravinder Tulsiani
While artificial intelligence (AI) presents organisations with the promise of unparalleled efficiencies and capabilities, it also presents some complex challenges and risks. This positions AI as both a beacon of innovation and a field filled with ethical dilemmas including bias, privacy concerns, job displacement and the dangers of overreliance on digital systems.  

AI offers immense opportunities for enhancing efficiency, spurring innovation and fostering business growth 

Integrating AI into the workplace requires a careful balance between leveraging its potential for innovation, growth and a re-imagined dynamic, while also addressing the risks it poses. It is imperative for organisations aiming to maintain their competitive edge and resilience to adopt methodologies that not only mitigate these risks but also ensure that this powerful technology serves to enhance our human workforce and uphold ethical standards, rather than undermining them. 
Understanding the risks 
Ethical considerations and bias: The impartiality of AI systems hinges on the neutrality of their training data. Biases in historical data can lead AI to perpetuate or amplify these prejudices, necessitating a thorough evaluation of datasets to forestall biased outcomes in recruitment, promotions and customer engagement. 
Privacy concerns: AI’s proficiency in analysing extensive datasets raises significant privacy issues. Implementing stringent data governance policies is paramount to protect sensitive information from unauthorised exploitation while leveraging AI’s benefits. 
Job displacement: AI’s automation capabilities might result in job displacement, highlighting the importance of retraining and upskilling employees to ensure their indispensability in an AI-augmented workplace. 
Dependence on technology: Excessive reliance on AI could expose organisations to technological failures or cyber threats. Establishing contingency plans and maintaining human oversight is essential to balance intuition and machine efficiency. 
Mitigating the risks 
Mitigating AI-associated workplace risks demands a proactive and encompassing strategy, including:

Strengthening data privacy measures: Enforcing robust data privacy protocols, such as encryption and access controls, is crucial for safeguarding sensitive data against breaches and unauthorised access. 
Fostering a culture of lifelong learning: Addressing job displacement requires investing in training programmes that furnish employees with the competencies to collaborate with AI technologies, emphasising technical and soft skills. 
Maintaining human oversight Human supervision is vital for monitoring AI operations, serving as a safety net for error correction and intervention to ensure ethical and equitable outcomes. 
Unlocking the opportunities 
Despite the risks, AI offers immense opportunities for enhancing efficiency, spurring innovation and fostering business growth, such as: 
Enhancing operational efficiency: Automating routine tasks with AI frees employees for more complex and fulfilling work, boosting productivity and job satisfaction. 
Driving innovation: AI’s advanced data analysis capabilities can unveil previously inaccessible insights, propelling innovation across product development, marketing and customer service. 
Personalisation at scale: AI facilitates personalised customer experiences on a large scale, improving satisfaction and loyalty by tailoring interactions to individual preferences. 
Predictive analytics for decision making: Leveraging AI for predictive insights enables businesses to anticipate market trends and customer behaviours, informing strategic decision making. 
Harnessing AI’s full potential 
Maximising AI’s benefits requires a strategic approach that includes continuous learning, fostering AI literacy across the organisation, committing to ethical AI usage, and promoting collaboration. 
Real-world examples of AI in the workplace 
From healthcare’s predictive patient care to financial fraud detection and customer service enhancements via chatbots, AI is demonstrating its transformative potential across various sectors, underscoring its role in driving efficiency and innovation. 
Strategies for successful AI integration 
Integrating AI effectively into the workplace transcends technological implementation, necessitating a holistic view that encompasses organisational culture, employee engagement, and ongoing improvement. Essential strategies include securing leadership support, engaging and training employees, starting with pilot projects, and forging partnerships to enhance AI capabilities. 
Looking forward: the future of AI in the workplace 
The intersection of AI and human intelligence is shaping a future workplace characterised by collaborative innovation and efficiency. However, this future also emphasises the need for ethical AI design and policies to ensure a fair transition into this new era. 
Conclusion 
Navigating AI’s integration into the workplace involves understanding and mitigating associated risks while embracing its opportunities for growth and innovation. Achieving successful AI integration hinges on a balanced approach that marries strategic implementation with ethical practices and continuous adaptation. The synergy between human and artificial intelligence promises a transformative impact on the workplace, enhancing productivity, creativity and overall wellbeing.

Global furniture retailer IKEA has long been at the forefront of tech-driven retail innovation. This includes artificial intelligence and augmented reality – two technologies that it has leveraged successfully to improve customer experience and service.


Now, it’s unleashing the power of generative AI to give customers even more power when it comes to designing their ideal homes. It’s also created an ethical AI task force made up of experts from across the entire business to ensure this hugely transformative technology is rolled out responsibly.

It is also investing heavily in skilling its staff so that the entire workforce can effectively use AI to solve problems and drive efficiency.

Recently, I was joined for my podcast by Parag Parekh, Chief Digital Officer at IKEA Retail (Ingka Group), who talked me through the company’s plans and philosophy around digital technology and generative AI in particular. So, let’s take a look at some of the innovative ways it’s being used.

Enhancing Customer Experience
IKEA has unveiled a new generative AI chatbot powered by ChatGPT, with the aim of giving every customer their own AI design assistant.
Initially rolling out in the US, with further expansion to follow, the chatbot can answer questions about products and purchases, as well as make personalized design suggestions.
It’s intended to be used alongside IKEA Kreativ, an innovative online tool that lets users visualize and design their own living spaces in a mixed-reality environment.

Parekh tells me, “If I take a traditional user journey pre the AI era – typically it would be visiting our website … you decide what you really want in your home and then you put it into the basket, come to our stores to check that out, then you complete the purchase and have it delivered to your home.

“Now, come AI … maybe the customer journey is different. You probably aren’t looking at single pieces of furniture, but you’re looking at furnishing your home, bringing that to life. We allow you to actually take a scan of your room and give you an experience of what that furniture would look like.”
With the power of generative AI, users can erase existing furniture and replace it with new items to get an idea of the look and feel that can be achieved.
But it doesn’t end there. Customers can then interact with the AI to give it more information – what style – traditional, Scandinavian, modern – are they looking for? What color schemes do they like? What about the lighting? What is the budget? The AI can then generate any number of options and variations to browse and choose between. It’s a bit like having a professional interior decorator sit with you, helping you create the look you want.
“That’s something that we are experimenting with. You already see part of it with what we have released, but it’s something that’s in the works, and we are working with our creative and planning services to say, how do we really change the customer experience?""
IKEA’s staff, too, will benefit from generative AI tools, particularly from something that Parekh refers to as the “AI toolbox”.
Built on a custom version of Microsoft’s Bing co-pilot, it lets them quickly create content and assets that demonstrate products in relevant ways for customers.
Parekh gives the example of repurposing marketing material for different audiences and markets.
“Here’s a picture of a sofa that’s available on our website … now we’re going into Christmas, and we need to adapt it so that the images and content are relevant to a Christmas campaign.”
Traditionally, this would have involved all of the effort and expense of conducting a new photoshoot and launch campaign.
“You want some Christmas decorations, and the toolbox helps you generate an image with a Christmas tree behind the sofa, and all of a sudden, you have it ready.”

AI In Operations And Supply Chain
Along with cutting-edge generative AI projects like this, IKEA is invested in many “traditional” AI operations aimed at driving efficiency and cutting waste.
This includes optimizing the space used in its fleets of delivery and supply vehicles and using drones to monitor warehouse inventory across 16 of its European stores. It also uses demand sensing to forecast short-term consumer demand patterns. One example has enabled IKEA Portugal to improve the accuracy of its demand forecasting by five percent.
In its brand new 25,000 cubic meter distribution center in Tianjin, near Beijing, China, it is testing Autonomous Mobile Robots. These are designed to pick and pack its 9,500 products in a way that improves working conditions for warehouse staff and more efficiently uses filling and packaging materials, delivering improved sustainability.
Parekh highlights the transformative journey of evolving from traditional physical retail towards omnichannel retailing, emphasizing the need for disruption in the supply chain. He points out the emergence of new expenses, including those associated with handling, storage, and delivery in this new retail environment. Parekh says, ""Here we are looking into how do we use AI to help us to bring affordability back into our supply chain … how do you put in an algorithm which optimizes for cost but also optimizes for a greener planet, and make sure that we ship the product from where it’s the most available and [also] the most convenient for the customer?""

Ethical And Responsible AI
IKEA’s AI task force has been put together to ensure this world-changing technology is rolled out in a way that will be beneficial for as many of its customers as possible while minimizing the potential for it to cause harm.
Parekh says, “This is one of the critical aspects where organizations need to take a much stronger stance.”
At the root of this is a human-centric approach, which involves starting every initiative by asking questions about what it will mean for customers and staff, as well as wider communities in general.
Parekh stresses the need to prioritize human values, asking if actions respect human agency and dignity and if a people-focused approach is central to all initiatives. Affirming these principles, he notes, paves the way for a thorough analysis of various use cases. This approach is characterized by a commitment to fairness, bias elimination, equity, inclusiveness, and privacy respect. Above all, he emphasizes that transparency is key. This commitment started with the introduction of a ""data promise"" in 2020 and continued recently with the relaunch of the company's digital ethics policy in 2023.
In order to ensure staff have the knowledge and understanding needed to implement this, IKEA has rolled out an AI literacy program that aims to train 3,000 staff in the fundamentals of ethical and responsible AI in 2024.
Parekh says, “We believe that 60 percent of our employees will need to be reskilled to do the jobs of tomorrow. And we’d rather start now to make sure that they are ready … that they are embracing it.”

Both are working to develop similar partnerships with other countries to promote AI safety.“This is the first agreement of its kind anywhere in the world,” Donelan said. “AI is already an extraordinary force for good in our society, and has vast potential to tackle some of the world’s biggest challenges, but only if we are able to grip those risks.”Generative AI – which can create text, photos and videos in response to open-ended prompts – has spurred excitement as well as fears it could make some jobs obsolete, upend elections and potentially overpower humans since the release of ChatGPT in November 2022.Both countries plan to share key information on capabilities and risks associated with AI models and systems and technical research on AI safety and security.In October, Joe Biden signed an executive order that aims to reduce the risks of AI. In January, the commerce department said it was proposing to require US cloud companies to determine whether foreign entities are accessing US data centers to train AI models.Britain said in February it would spend more than £100m ($125.5m) to launch nine new research hubs and train AI regulators about the technology.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyArtificial intelligence (AI)Joe BidenRishi SunaknewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedSunday was world’s hottest ever recorded day, data suggestsWhen a bad Trump joke becomes an affair of state, Germany has lost more than its sense of humourFatma Aydemir‘We pledged not to eat each other’: the family that was shipwrecked for 38 daysWho might Kamala Harris pick for VP?

            The use of artificial intelligence will reduce the number of workers at thousands of companies over the next five years, according to a global survey of C-suite executives published Friday.
    

            The wide-ranging poll of 2,000 executives, conducted by Swiss staffing firm Adecco Group in collaboration with research firm Oxford Economics, showed that 41% of them expect to employ fewer people because of the technology.
    

            The survey’s results provide another indication of the potential for AI and generative AI — which can create original text, images and other content in response to prompts from users — to revolutionize employment and the way people work.

            AI is emerging “as a great disruptor in the world of work,” Denis Machuel, chief executive of Adecco Group, said in a statement. “Companies must do more to re-skill and redeploy teams to make the most of this technological leap and avoid unnecessary upheaval.”
    

            The executives surveyed work in 18 industries — including energy, retail and the automotive sector — in nine countries, including the United States, Canada, Germany and Japan. Their workforces represent white-collar and blue-collar jobs.

            Some 46% of executives said they would redeploy employees internally if their jobs were impacted by AI. And two-thirds said they planned to recruit people skilled in AI compared with just over one-third who said they would train their existing workforce in the technology.
    

            The survey makes for grimmer reading for workers than another recent large poll, conducted by the World Economic Forum last year. Responses from more than 800 global companies showed that a quarter of them expected AI to cause job losses, while half thought the technology would create new jobs.
    

            The WEF said employers expected most technologies, including AI, to be “a net positive” for jobs over the following five years. “Big data analytics, climate change and environmental management technologies, and encryption and cybersecurity are expected to be the biggest drivers of job growth,” it noted.
    

            Still, that offers little consolation to the workers AI has already helped push out. In the past year, some tech firms, including file storage service Dropbox and language-learning app Duolingo, have cited AI as a reason for making lay-offs.
    

            Goldman Sachs economists said in March last year that as many as 300 million full-time jobs could be lost or diminished globally by the rise of generative AI, with white-collar workers likely to be the most at risk.

A new EU-OSHA discussion paper on the application of artificial intelligence to regulate and manage the workforce, realised by Maria Enrica Virgillito, Associate Professor of Economics at the Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies, and Jacopo Staccioli (Department of Economic Policy, Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Milan), has just been released. The discussion paper is part of the EU Healthy Workplace Campaign “Safe and healthy work in the digital age”.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is shifting the nature of work and work relationships. This paper maps AI-based worker management (AIWM) technologies and their sectoral penetration, through analysis of patent data and content. It puts forward a measurement-based approach that can be used to investigate the impact of AIWM technologies on the workforce, tasks and functions. The findings point to the adverse impact that AIWM can have on workers’ safety and health in terms of control, monitoring, profiling, and more in general techno-stress. Importantly, the research shows only a marginal fraction of patents aimed at improving human wellbeing, underscoring a lack in corporate interest to employ such technologies to improve OSH. On the contrary, the main scopes of application include productivity increases and efficiency gains.

Armed with a $2 billion war chest, they’re trying to transform KPMG so its 270,000 workers are trained to use generative artificial intelligence from drafting meeting minutes to analyzing tax documents, from writing spreadsheet formulas to letting their staffers experiment with novel uses in a safe, digital sandbox.  “We’re attempting to put AI into everything we do,” said Steve Chase, vice chair of AI and digital innovation for KPMG US. “That is our mission statement.”Almost all of the 220 top executives at companies the US firm surveyed recently said they planned to invest in generative AI over the next year with nearly half doling out at least $100 million. And KPMG, which offers services from accounting to technology implementation, wants to be in position to compete for their business, said David Rowlands, KPMG’s global head of artificial intelligence. Bloomberg Tax recently sat down with Chase and Rowlands to discuss the firm’s AI vision. The newest form of the technology could be used to help marketing teams write copy faster or assist software developers to check the code they’re writing. Corporations could also use it to track and manage regulations and other legal obligations, Chase said.Mission: AI Training KPMG’s army of accountants and business consultants to use generative AI has been a top focus of the firm. The company wants those professional to serve as ambassadors of the technology, demonstrating how it could be used and knowledgeable enough to answer clients questions, Rowlands said.In January, the firm held a 24-hour marathon of training for staff at affiliates around the world and across service lines.Chase wants KPMG professionals to be able to answer clients’ top questions including how to use AI tools, he said. One of the challenges is developing training courses that keep pace with the technology’s rapid development. “The tech can change faster than the people can change,” Chase said.He predicts that AI skills will become a necessity for workers from accountants to coders to master to remain competitive in the labor market.Promised productivity gains however raise fresh questions about the firm’s own strategies—like whether to expand the role of its support centers that dot the globe and what type of work those locations should handle, Chase said.But the transition to generative AI provides an opportunity for the firm to grow. “There will be more roles for KPMG as a consequence,” Rowlands said.The Big Four firm is trying to get ahead of demand from clients, which is expected to soar over the coming year as companies pivot from experimenting with generative AI to preparing for wide-scale adoption.As a model to its clients, KPMG aims to demonstrate how it adopted the technology, the two leaders said. That includes supporting its workers to incorporate the controls needed to return reliable, verifiable results.Billions PlannedKPMG has leaned heavily on its partnership with Microsoft to put OpenAI and the tech giant’s copilot virtual assistant into the hands of its staffers. But the firm has also designed its own generative AI functions including a tool for tax clients to research their own documents a feature of the firm’s tax platform announced last month.Some tried-and-true methods are proving tough to supplant, however, including spreadsheet software that for decades has been the workhorse of CPA firms and accounting departments.KPMG staff now turn to generative AI to help them construct formulas for Excel—making spreadsheet queries one of the most common AI prompts, Chase said.It’s a race with competitors who are taking similar strides to help their clients find the best use cases and roll out tools that could reshape their workforce.The other Big Four firms weren’t far behind touting their AI bona fides when the technology burst onto the scene roughly a year ago.Since then, PwC’s US arms committed to spending at least $1 billion on the nascent technology. The firm has put generative AI into the hands of its staff lawyers and clients including a tool announced last month that can redline contracts and extract data among other features. Backed by a $1.4 billion investment, EY launched its own version of ChatGPT, called EYQ, in October to help the firm’s professionals brainstorm and conduct research. The firm has also made AI training available to its 400,000-person global workforce and launched a series of services to help clients adopt and to set up governance over the technolog, the firm said. Deloitte’s US affilite has launched a batch of tools to help its tax practice take the bite out of busy seasons, including a tool that lets staff describe how it wants data formatted. Other tools help staff prioritize what areas of a tax return to scrutinize. —with assistance from Isabel Gottlieb.

The New Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer Role Balances AI Champion And Risk Manager 



Alla Valente, Senior Analyst                            

Cody Scott, Senior Analyst                              


                        Apr 3 2024                      











 



On March 28, 2024, the US Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released a memorandum, M-24-10 (basically a regulatory requirement for federal agencies), creating the new role responsible for operationalizing the Executive Order (EO) on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence, issued last fall. Per the OMB memo, agencies named in the CFO Act will have 60 days to appoint a chief artificial intelligence officer (CAIO) with a remit to: 1) strengthen AI governance; 2) advance responsible AI innovation; and 3) manage risks from the use of AI.
While new role creation to introduce accountability for advancing the federal agenda isn’t new — in 2019, the OMB did the same in establishing the chief data officer (CDO) role to lead agency digital transformation efforts — what’s unique about the CAIO is the role’s level of authority, seniority, skill set, and broad risk management responsibilities.
We believe that the requirement for federal agencies will accelerate this role in the private sector. Tech execs can use the OMB memo as a starting point for the skills and requirements of a CAIO role, although the specific responsibilities for CAIOs will be unique to each organization’s AI goals, business strategies, and risk appetite. For a deeper understanding of risk management’s role in supporting AI, read Generative AI: What It Means For Governance, Risk, And Compliance.
The CAIO Has Broad Authority For Transformational Change
The OMB memo states that the CAIO role “must be a position at the Senior Executive Service [SES], Scientific and Professional, or Senior Leader level.” This unusually high rank is justified by noting that the CAIO must have the “necessary authority to perform the responsibilities in this section and must be positioned highly enough to engage regularly with other agency leadership, to include the Deputy Secretary or equivalent.” If the agency already has someone appointed to the role, the memo urges agencies to evaluate whether that individual needs additional authority to do their job at this level.

What To Know: The EO gives CAIOs broad responsibility over the coordination, innovation, and risk management for their agency’s use of AI. This position is more than just influencing policy and managing data calls (internal questionnaires) — instead, it requires development of partnership, and strategy, as well as direct operational involvement to bring about change. In other words, this role isn’t reactive. It’s not about simply mitigating AI’s downside risk (often a compliance initiative guised as “risk management”). Rather, it’s about promoting use of AI, which implies that orgs need a strategy and mature understanding of AI use aligned with mission objectives.
What To Avoid: Transformational change happens neither overnight nor in a vacuum. Since the OMB requires this position to be an SES, it speaks to the caliber of results expected from agency performance. Agencies can better plan for success by taking advantage of the existing process maturity across their CIO, CISO, CDO, and CFO teams by partnering to build a cohesive strategy for AI inventorying, risk management, and innovation. Those same processes are often a barrier to change initiatives, however, so leverage internal partnerships and set clear internal roles and responsibilities to clear operational hurdles early on.

This Ain’t Your Average Lateral Hire
The CAIO must have the skills, knowledge, and expertise to do the job, since the primary role of the CAIO is “coordination, innovation, and risk management for their agency’s use of AI specifically, as opposed to data or IT issues in general.” Internal hires are allowed, so long as they have “significant expertise in AI.” This is not a “hire now, learn on the job” position.

What To Know: When federal mandates require a new SES position, you know that the directive is more than just a compliance exercise. For example, in 2019, the OMB required agencies to appoint a chief data officer but without the SES seniority, which meant that the position would function inconsistently across agencies. This marks a shift in expectations by placing accountability and authority within the senior leadership team. It also means the position must be equally adept in technology, operations, and strategy.
What To Avoid: Don’t rush to appoint someone with an existing SES title and take external hires off the table. Given the scope, complexity, and guaranteed changes that this position will have to navigate, treat this directive as an opportunity to look for unique skills and long-term leadership. AI skills and knowledge are new, and few will have direct experience today. But equally as important is the role’s focus on risk management and innovation. Make these attributes key requirements for the position, then determine the best hiring strategy.

A CAIO’s Responsibilities Mirror That Of A Chief Risk Officer
The role may have AI in the title, but risk management shouldn’t be overlooked. The responsibilities detailed in the memo section “Managing Risks from the Use of AI” read like a job description for what Forrester describes as a transformational chief risk officer (CRO) who understands that risk is necessary for growth and innovation and that risk management is an accelerator to go faster, not slower.

What To Know: AI inventories is a start. The CAIO, like a CRO, will need tools that help them identify AI risk, conduct risk assessments, and measure and monitor the agency’s ongoing performance and effectiveness toward AI. To be successful, this role requires an equivalent governance, risk, and compliance technology stack, not a single tool.
What To Avoid: The gut reaction for most OMB mandates is a request for information, but as often with manual collection methods, by the time the data is aggregated into a pretty dashboard, it’s already stale. Data calls alone will not make this role successful nor sustainable. CAIOs will also need to master the five competencies of the Forrester Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Success Cycle — identify, evaluate, respond, monitor, and communicate — to keep pace with innovation and potential pitfalls that they create.

Much has been written about the potential impact of generative AI in the workplace, but the perspective of one set of key stakeholders has often been left out: workers themselves.  What’s more, research has found that incorporating the perspective of end users such as workers into the development and implementation of new technologies tends to produce better results than strictly top-down technology development approaches.
About the MIT Institute for Work and Employment Research (IWER)IWER is a multidisciplinary research and teaching unit that is located within the MIT Sloan School.  IWER’s mission is to conduct and disseminate cutting-edge research that improves the lives of workers and their loved ones and guides managers in crafting a successful and inclusive future of work.

So argues a new working paper coauthored by an interdisciplinary team of  MIT researchers. The new paper, “Bringing Worker Voice into Generative AI,” was recently published online as part of a new collection called An MIT Exploration of Generative AI. This collection consists of 25 papers on the societal impact of generative AI that were authored by members of the MIT faculty, with support from seed grants from MIT.  “Bringing Worker Voice Into Generative AI” was coauthored by Thomas A. Kochan, the George M. Bunker Professor Emeritus at the MIT Sloan School of Management and a member of the faculty of the MIT Institute for Work and Employment Research (IWER); Ben Armstrong, Executive Director and Research Scientist at the MIT Industrial Performance Center; Julie Shah, the H.N. Slater Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics at MIT and Director of the Interactive Robotics Group at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL); Emilio J. Castilla, the NTU Professor of Work and Organization Studies at MIT Sloan and Co-Director of IWER; Ben Likis, 2024 MBA Candidate at MIT Sloan; and Martha E. Mangelsdorf, Director of Strategic Communications at IWER.
The researchers conducted more than 50 interviews with a cross-section of stakeholders that included AI developers, business leaders, labor leaders, academic experts, and policymakers. In their interviews with AI developers, the authors learned that some factors weigh against incorporating worker input into the design of AI tools—including the pressure technology vendors feel to bring products to market quickly, without taking the time to incorporate worker input. “A number of our interviewees, along with the published works by scholars, suggest that there is a bias toward labor-displacing/replacing humans in the minds of many inventors or technology vendors,” Kochan, Armstrong, Shah, Castilla, Likis, and Mangelsdorf write.
But the authors also found examples of other approaches. They note, for instance, that Microsoft Corp. recently formed a partnership with the AFL-CIO labor federation to share information about how AI is impacting the workplace and to incorporate worker voice and experiences into the development of AI technology. Kochan et al. see this as an approach that might be a model.
In general, “the broader the set of stakeholders involved in defining the problems and opportunities that generative AI technologies can address, the more likely it is that these tools will be used to augment how workers do their jobs rather than displace them,” Kochan, Armstrong, Shah, Castilla, Likis, and Mangelsdorf write.
The authors also argue that, more than many previous new technologies, generative AI is particularly conducive to “bottom-up” innovation processes by workers and teams who use the tools. “This ‘democratization’ feature of generative AI opens up possibilities for the workforce to exert greater influence in how the technology evolves than was possible during many prior technological changes,” Kochan et al. observe. Moreover, the authors’ interviews with business leaders revealed that some companies are indeed incorporating “bottom-up” input from employees as one part of generating promising use cases for generative AI.
The research team also interviewed U.S. labor leaders, and the authors observe that unions have both an increasing interest and capacity to engage proactively with other stakeholders about the impact of AI. Examples include the partnership with Microsoft and collective bargaining agreements reached in 2023 between the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers and the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA); these new collective bargaining agreements incorporate protections for members of those unions regarding the use of generative AI in their professions.
The authors conclude with set of recommendations designed to encourage the incorporation of the perspective of the workforce into four phases of AI design and development: 1) defining the problems and opportunities to be addressed; 2) designing the technical and work process features that need to be integrated; 3) educating and training the workforce in the skills needed; and 4) ensuring a fair transition and compensation for those whose jobs are affected.
“We see this report as a first step in encouraging ongoing research, teaching, and outreach by MIT faculty and students to help bring the voices of the workforce into generative AI,” Kochan, Armstrong, Shah, Castilla, Likis, and Mangelsdorf conclude. “We hope this report serves as a catalyst for taking up this critical challenge and opportunity.”

Are bigger language models always better?

  4 min read - As enterprises look to separate the hype from where AI can add true value, it’s unclear if increasingly larger language models will always lead to better business solutions.

An agreement, signed by Michelle Donelan, the U.K. Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology, and U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, sets out a plan for collaboration between the two governments.“I think of [the agreement] as marking the next chapter in our journey on AI safety, working hand in glove with the United States government,” Donelan told TIME in an interview at the British Embassy in Washington, D.C. on Monday. “I see the role of the United States and the U.K. as being the real driving force in what will become a network of institutes eventually.”The U.K. and U.S. AI Safety Institutes were established just one day apart, around the inaugural AI Safety Summit hosted by the U.K. government at Bletchley Park in November 2023. While the two organizations’ cooperation was announced at the time of their creation, Donelan says that the new agreement “formalizes” and “puts meat on the bones” of that cooperation. She also said it “offers the opportunity for them—the United States government—to lean on us a little bit in the stage where they're establishing and formalizing their institute, because ours is up and running and fully functioning.”The two AI safety testing bodies will develop a common approach to AI safety testing that involves using the same methods and underlying infrastructure, according to a news release. The bodies will look to exchange employees and share information with each other “in accordance with national laws and regulations, and contracts.” The release also stated that the institutes intend to perform a joint testing exercise on an AI model available to the public.“The U.K. and the United States have always been clear that ensuring the safe development of AI is a shared global issue,” said Secretary Raimondo in a press release accompanying the partnership’s announcement. “Reflecting the importance of ongoing international collaboration, today’s announcement will also see both countries sharing vital information about the capabilities and risks associated with AI models and systems, as well as fundamental technical research on AI safety and security.” Safety tests such as those being developed by the U.K. and U.S. AI Safety Institutes are set to play an important role in efforts by lawmakers and tech company executives to mitigate the risks posed by rapidly progressing AI systems. OpenAI and Anthropic, the companies behind the chatbots ChatGPT and Claude, respectively, have published detailed plans for how they expect safety tests to inform their future product development. The recently passed E.U. AI Act and U.S. President Joe Biden’s executive order on AI both require companies developing powerful AI models to disclose the results of safety tests.Read More: Nobody Knows How to Safety-Test AIThe U.K. government under Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has played a leading role in marshaling an international response to the most powerful AI models—often referred to as “frontier AI”—convening the first AI Safety Summit and committing £100 million ($125 million) to the U.K. AI Safety Institute. The U.S., however, despite its economic might and the fact that almost all leading AI companies are based on its soil, has so far committed $10 million to the U.S. AI Safety Institute. (The National Institute of Standards and Technology, the government agency that houses the U.S. AI Safety Institute, suffers from chronic underinvestment.) Donelan rejected the suggestion that the U.S. is failing to pull its weight, arguing that the $10 million is not a fair representation of the resources being dedicated to AI across the U.S. government.“They are investing time and energy in this agenda,” said Donelan, fresh off a meeting with Raimondo, who Donelan says “fully appreciates the need for us to work together on gripping the risks to seize the opportunities.” Donelan argues that in addition to the $10 million in funding for the U.S. AI Safety Institute, the U.S. government “is also tapping into the wealth of expertise across government that already exists.”Despite its leadership on some aspects of AI, the U.K. government has decided not to pass legislation that would mitigate the risks from frontier AI. Donelan’s opposite number, the U.K. Labour Party’s Shadow Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology Peter Kyle, has said repeatedly that a Labour government would pass laws mandating that tech companies share the results of AI safety tests with the government, rather than relying on voluntary agreements. Donelan however, says the U.K. will refrain from regulating AI in the short term to avoid curbing industry growth or passing laws that are made obsolete by technological progress.“We don't think it would be right to rush to legislate. We've been very outspoken on that,” Donelan told TIME. “That is the area where we do diverge from the E.U. We want to be fostering innovation, we want to be getting this sector to grow in the UK.”The memorandum commits the two countries to developing similar partnerships with other countries. Donelan says that “a number of nations are either in the process of or thinking about setting up their own institutes,” although she did not specify which. (Japan announced the establishment of its own AI Safety Institute in February.) “AI does not respect geographical boundaries,” said Donelan. “We are going to have to work internationally on this agenda, and collaborate and share information and share expertise if we are going to really make sure that this is a force for good for mankind.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 By Editorial Staff


April 05, 2024 - Generative AI use cases and workforce management--specifically in light of severe labor shortages--dominated the conversation at HIMSS 2024.
Rich Birhanzel, senior managing director and global health lead at Accenture, shares his insights on these two pervasive and, at times, controversial issues facing the healthcare industry. Birhanzel highlighted the extensive conversation around AI applications, detailing the most common use cases. Alongside the enthusiasm for AI, he also addressed the growing focus on responsible use and privacy and security concerns.
Moreover, Birhanzel underscored the urgency of addressing the global crisis of patient access due to workforce shortages. He stressed the importance of automation through generative AI. However, this approach may require a cognitive shift as it will change providers' workflows, Birhanzel acknowledged. He emphasized the need for harmonization between technology and human workflows.


Rich Birhanzel:
[Intro clip] Patient access is the global crisis that we have in healthcare today. We don't have enough humans that are trained or could be trained to serve the healthcare needs. We have to embrace technology.

Kelsey Waddill:
Welcome to Season 2 of Industry Perspectives, coming to you from HIMSS 2024 in Orlando, Florida. I'm Kelsey Waddill, Multimedia Manager and Managing Editor at Xtelligent Healthcare Media. And if you didn't get to go to HIMSS this year, first of all, I'm sorry, it was awesome. And second, this episode is for you.
Today, we'll get to hear all the highlights from Rich Birhanzel, senior managing director and global health lead at Accenture, as he and I sit down to discuss some of the main themes of the conference. Rich also offered some of his own insights on workforce management and generative AI. He covered it all very succinctly, and I think you'll really appreciate his perspective. So without further ado, here's what he had to say.
Thank you, Rich, for coming on to Healthcare Strategies. It's a pleasure to get to sit down with you in person. We don't get this kind of opportunity very often. So I just want to start out by talking about, I'm sure you've been having a lot of really interesting conversations here at HIMSS. What are some of the ones that stand out to you? What are the topics that are swirling around here that you think are the most important for people to know about?
Rich Birhanzel:
READ MORE: How Healthcare Technology Can Improve, Worsen Provider BurnoutSo the two things that we've noted--and it's kind of what we expected--AI is everywhere. Everybody's talking about artificial intelligence and what the possibilities are, what the worries are, what progress has been made. So there's a whole lot of conversation about that. And then the second thing is the labor shortage that exists on the clinician side, the challenges that the health systems and hospitals are having in being able to serve as many patients as they were able to do before.
Kelsey Waddill:
And I'm sure those things can get tied together sometimes too because a lot of people are turning to AI as a sort of relief for workforce management right now.
Let's talk about the AI part first. Obviously, we've had a boom in generative AI use this year. Have there been any really interesting kind of use cases or implementations of generative AI that you've seen that you thought [were] maybe going to pick up steam this year?
Rich Birhanzel:
READ MORE: How Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning Impact Care CoordinationSo the progress in healthcare around gen AI--and we're seeing it here at the conferences as demonstrations--has been in maybe four areas.
Contact center is the first because it's very much focused on language and generative AI is particularly useful when you're talking about language. And so the ability to better enable call center agents and create some efficiencies in some of the work that they do is sort of the first place. And we're seeing quite a bit of maturity in the call center space with generative AI.
The second space is the delivery of technology. So, thinking about how you can use some of the generative AI tools to create efficiency in the creation of code, the testing of code, and whatever projects that health companies are pursuing. So this has come fairly quickly over the last couple of quarters, where we're seeing a maturity in the ability to change the way we think about technology delivery.
A third area would be in learning. So again, learning is typically a highly language-focused activity. And so we're seeing quite a bit of progress in the use of generative AI to reinvent the way that we're doing learning. And then also learning is a focused area on teaching people how to get more familiarized with generative AI and be able to use it. Whether it's a call center agent, a claims processor, a physician, a front desk person, whatever it may be, there's a certain amount of understanding that needs to exist.
And then the fourth area is the one that people get the most excited about and you see a lot of this energy over on the show floor, which is around the use of ambient listening technology to listen to a patient and physician, or a patient and nurse conversation and automatically create a patient summary to reduce the amount of administrative burden that clinicians have.
Right now, we see about 20 percent to 40 percent of a clinician's time being focused on documentation. And what these tools have the promise to deliver is to remove that kind of burden. Sometimes that's done while they're talking to the patient, so that can become more efficient. Oftentimes it's done after their workday is done, so then we can give them the opportunity to reset, refresh and get ready for the next day. So a whole lot of energy around these emerging technologies, and these are in the field now. We're seeing experience with it now, and it has the promise to address some of the clinician overload that we see and lack of clinical capacity that is a problem for all of us.
Kelsey Waddill:
Yeah, absolutely. I want to get to that in a second. I was curious, one of the big question marks with AI right now and more broadly in the healthcare system--especially with the Change Healthcare attack--is privacy and security around AI. I'm wondering if you've been having any conversations with people about that and what have been the prevailing thoughts about how to secure these newer technologies?
Rich Birhanzel:
So there's a significant amount of conversation about responsible use. And one of the elements of responsible use among others is the consideration around privacy and security. The point of view we have and what we are seeing people talk about is that we need to think about responsible use before we go deploy these use cases into the field. It has a lot to do with what's the data foundation that the generative AI or AI is based upon. If it's something that's controlled and known inside of a health system, then it's sort of got a certain confidence level because it's data they already have.
When you start to extend that into other data sources, then it becomes a little bit more difficult. And being able to understand what exposure is being created when we deploy these models is essential. And the key part of that is it has to be done early before it gets deployed. And we think about that as part of the responsible use space.
There's other things in there like making sure we don't see bias in the data or bias in the recommendations that are coming back, that we are mindful of health equity as we deploy these tools. Those are examples of things, but there's been a considerable amount of conversation about that. And I think the other consideration here too is the use of generative AI, or AI, to also improve information security and use it as a tool to enhance and improve the way that health organizations protect their data.
Kelsey Waddill:
Makes sense. I'm sure we could dive into that a lot more, but I did want to make sure that we get to the workforce management piece.
Rich Birhanzel:
Sure.
Kelsey Waddill:
And so, obviously, last year we had the Kaiser Permanente strike, partly over this very issue. We've seen a lot of outcry among the provider population about the workload that they're experiencing right now, the administrative burden that they're experiencing. Where is the focus right now in terms of how to address these outcries?
Rich Birhanzel:
It's a great point, and it is a top topic. Patient access is the global crisis that we have in healthcare today. It's not just a US issue, it's an issue around the world. And the truth is we don't have enough humans that are trained or could be trained to serve the healthcare needs that we have around the world. So we have to embrace technology to create efficiency and make better use of the talent that we do have.
The areas of focus right now are about enablement. They're about taking administrative tasks that a clinician, nurse, physician, whatever role on the care team might play and take that role, think about the administrative task, like the documentation of a patient summary. That's a good example. Or a discharge plan as another example. Generative AI and particularly connected ambient listening can do that now, the tech is here. But to get it right, we have to harmonize that tech with the work of the clinician.
So when we take those tasks away, you might have a physician--let's say that part of their normal course of engaging with a patient would be to take handwritten notes or they might prefer or choose to type right into an EMR. That's a cognitive process that has been matured over time. And sometimes they do that not just to document, sometimes maybe they're doing that to catch up to their thoughts and think about what they're going to say next to the patient. But when we take that away and it's just a straight conversation that's being listened to by a computer, and then it's nice that it's going to create a patient summary later, we're changing their cognitive process.
So the energy that needs to happen now to really bring this out at scale is to harmonize that technology with the humans that are going to benefit from it. And that work is in its very early stages. There's much more to be done there to think about how we connect that human experience and improve their work so that we get the end goal here, which is to reduce the burnout, to create some capacity so that the clinicians that we do have can accomplish more and have better experiences in the work that they do.
Kelsey Waddill:
Yeah, can you talk a little bit more about that harmonization process? What is involved? I mean, I imagine that involves a lot of conversation between providers and the innovators who are creating these?
Rich Birhanzel:
Yeah, so it's early stages right now, but the idea with this is to go look at... Let's just take the clinical visit as an example, a typical clinical visit. What does the process usually look like? A nurse might start by taking a few measurements, asking a few questions, some diagnostic, and enter that into the EMR. That might be a typical thing to do. And then after some time waiting for the doctor to come in, if that's what the next step is, then the doctor comes in, might verify some of that information, then start to have a more thorough diagnostic conversation. ""What's going on? How are you feeling?"" And so forth.
And what we're talking about here is taking that process and then re-imagining that process. Imagine a world where the nurse doesn't have to ask all those questions, or particularly doesn't have to document all those questions. We might not even need to do that process step at all. But if we do need to do it, it might just be the nurse talking to the person and we capture that information and automatically update the clinical record. And then the physician comes in the room, and again, they don't need to go back to the EMR, they don't need to go look at handwritten notes or whatever their source might be. They can just have the conversation. They'll know what the information is, they'll have some sort of display and the listening capability will pay attention to the conversation. It will store what's being learned back into the clinical record.
And if there's an order given of, ""hey, we need to go prescribe this,"" or ""we need to go do a certain test,"" that also automatically feeds in the background to create the order, to create whatever needs to come next. So when we do that, what we're really talking about is re-examining both the process, but also the roles of the people in the process--particularly the clinician, but in some cases, in some ways, even the patient. Because it'll feel very different to a patient when you don't have this back and forth of, ""I'm going to tell you something, you're going to go write it down."" It's just a conversation. We think it will feel better in the long run, but it might feel awkward initially. So we'll have to get through that learning curve.
Kelsey Waddill:
Yeah, that's super interesting because almost like a blend of workflow change, but also almost like psychology and philosophy, too.
Rich Birhanzel:
Yes. Very much behavioral science in this, because you're really changing a cognitive process. And what we want to do is really figure out what is that way of leveraging the tech that works best so that the physician and the nurse can do what they're really great at, and the patient can have a good experience, and we remove the things that can be handled easily by technology.
Kelsey Waddill:
To free up the workforce so that they have more time to actually see patients.
Rich Birhanzel:
Yeah.
Kelsey Waddill:
Yeah, amazing. Well, let's hope that this stuff kind of gets off the ground and we can get that sort of harmonization down quickly.

Yeah.

But that hasn’t stopped lawyers and other legal workers from doing it anyway. Most legal professionals who have used generative AI in their practice have used the technology for legal research, according to data from Bloomberg Law’s 2024 Legal Operations and Technology survey.Respondents were asked how they have used generative AI in their practice, and were presented with a list of possible legal tasks, along with an option to respond that they haven’t used generative AI for work at all. Most respondents (54%) chose that option, saying that they have not used generative AI for work purposes. Among the 46% of respondents who have used AI for work, legal research was the most common way they reported using the technology in their practice. In fact, the use case more than doubled any of the other tasks on the list, except for drafting/templating communication (46%).  At an initial glance, the prevalence of using AI for legal research in early 2024 may appear surprising. There have been numerous headlines spotlighting attorney blunders while using generative AI for legal research that resulted in fake or improper citations being submitted to the court. And as a result, many courts are grappling with how to prevent—and punish—these instances. This recent push to sanction attorneys who file pleadings with AI-generated “caselaw” would seem to discourage legal professionals from using the technology for legal research. However, this type of scrutiny is all a necessary part of the process of technology adoption, especially in the legal industry. It’s worth remembering that just a few years ago, legal professionals had to confront eDiscovery technology and the implications of using technology-assisted review in conversations similar to the ones happening over generative AI now.The reality is, the usability concerns currently surrounding generative AI-powered legal research cannot be adequately addressed until the practice is adequately explored—which law firms, in-house legal departments, and even courts are currently doing.Results from the 2024 Legal Operations and Technology survey will be posted to Bloomberg Law’s Surveys, Reports, and Data Analysis page, which contains reports of the 2021, 2022, and 2023 versions of the survey.Bloomberg Law subscribers can find related content in our Legal Operations page and In Focus: Artificial Intelligence page.If you’re reading this on the Bloomberg Terminal, please run BLAW OUT <GO> to access the hyperlinked content, or click HERE to view the web version of this article.To contact the reporter on this story: Stephanie Pacheco at spacheco@bloombergindustry.comTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Robert Combs at rcombs@bloomberglaw.com Learn more about Bloomberg Law or Log In to keep reading:  Learn About Bloomberg Law  AI-powered legal analytics, workflow tools and premium legal & business news.

The AI workforce at Meta has taken a hit following several high-level departures from the tech giant.
Employees are facing challenges in using AI for only existing and successful products rather than experimental projects, which is driving the shift.

Considering the growing demand for AI professionals, social media giant Meta has taken the lead in wooing AI engineers with attractive packages and benefits. However, the company is struggling to hold onto its AI team, with several key members seeking opportunities in AI startups. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has personally penned emails to such professionals in addition to the large salary packages and benefits.
At least three high-level AI employees, including Director of Generative AI Devi Parikh, research scientist Abhishek Das, and Director of Engineering Erik Meijer, have left Meta in recent weeks. Erik Meijer used to lead a 50-person Probability team that worked on machine learning infrastructure. While most of the team was laid off in 2022, Meijer continued working on machine learning frameworks. However, he, too, has now quit, stating that he has an AI startup in the works despite offers from the leading companies in the sector. Parikh and Das also have similar views.

Leading AI professionals increasingly opine that working on LLMs outside big tech companies is better. Meta itself has seen an exodus of more than 30% of employees in its AI projects since the start of 2023. The reasoning behind this is the need to improve access to computing resources and the unwillingness of big tech companies to invest in complex experimental projects despite having access to the billions required for training LLMs.
The departure of AI professionals from Big Tech firms is a trend that has contributed to the emergence of firms such as Anthropic, Cohere, OpenAI, and others. Such companies offer innovators the scope and pace of development that big companies cannot, owing to fears of disruption to the market and customers. Despite this disadvantage, companies like Meta, owing to their resources, will not struggle to meet their AI goals for the foreseeable future.

Those of us who are not lawyers understandably find it difficult to suss out what it really means, and what it does and doesn’t protect. Data scientists don’t spend a lot of time thinking about copyright, unless we’re choosing a license for our open source projects. Even then, sometimes we just skip past that bit and don’t really deal with it, even though we know we should. But the legal world is starting to take a close look at how copyright intersects with generative AI, and this could have a real impact on our work. Before we talk about how it is affecting the world of generative AI, let’s recap the truth of copyright.CopyrightUS copyright law is relevant to what are called “original works of authorship”. This includes things under these categories: literary; musical; dramatic; pantomimes and choreographic work; pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works; audio-visual works; sound recordings; derivative works; compilations; architectural works.Content must be written or documented to be copyrightable. “Ideas are not copyrightable. Only tangible forms of expression (e.g., a book, play, drawing, film, or photo, etc.) are copyrightable. Once you express your idea in a fixed form — as a digital painting, recorded song, or even scribbled on a napkin — it is automatically copyrighted if it is an original work of authorship.” — Electronic Frontier FoundationBeing protected means that only the copyright holder (the author or creator, descendants inheriting the rights, or purchaser of the rights) can do these things: make and sell copies of the works, create derivative works from the originals, and perform or display the works publicly.Copyright isn’t forever, and it ends after a certain amount of time has elapsed. Usually, this is 70 years after the author’s death or 95 years after publication of the content. (Anything from before 1929 in the US is generally in the “public domain”, which means it is no longer covered by copyright.)Why does copyright exist at all? Recent legal interpretations argue that the whole point is not to just let creators get rich, but to encourage creation so that we have a society containing art and cultural creativity. Basically we exchange money with creators so they are incentivized to create great things for us to have. This means that a lot of courts look at copyright cases and ask, “Is this copy conducive to a creative, artistic, innovative society?” and take that into consideration when making judgments as well.Fair UseIn addition, “fair use” is not a free pass to ignore copyright. There are four tests to decide if a use of content is “fair use”:The purpose and character of the second use: Are you doing something innovative and different with the content, or are you just replicating the original? Is your new thing innovative on its own? If so, it’s more likely to be fair use. Also, if your use is to make money, that is less likely to be fair use.The nature of the original: If the original is creative, it’s harder to break copyright with fair use. If it’s just facts, then you’re more likely to be able to apply fair use (think of quoting research articles or encyclopedias).Amount used: Are you copying the whole thing? Or just, say, a paragraph or a small section? Using as little as is necessary is important for fair use, although sometimes you may need to use a lot for your derivative work.Effect: Are you stealing customers from the original? Are people going to buy or use your copy instead of buying the original? Is the creator going to lose money or market share because of your copy? If so, it’s likely not fair use. (This is relevant even if you don’t make any money.)You have to meet ALL of these tests to get to be fair use, not just one or two. All of this is, of course, subject to legal interpretation. (This article is NOT legal advice!) But now, with these facts in our pocket, let’s think about what Generative AI does and why the concepts above are crashing into Generative AI.Generative AI RecapRegular readers of my column will have a pretty clear understanding of how generative AI is trained already, but let’s do a very quick recap.Giant volumes of data are collected, and a model learns by analyzing the patterns that exist in that data. (As I’ve written before: “Some reports indicate that GPT-4 had on the order of 1 trillion words in its training data. Every one of those words was written by a person, out of their own creative capability. For context, book 1 in the Game of Thrones series was about 292,727 words. So, the training data for GPT-4 was about 3,416,152 copies of that book long.”)When the model has learned the patterns in the data (for an LLM, it learns all about language semantics, grammar, vocabulary, and idioms), then it will be fine tuned by human, so that it will behave as desired when people interact with it. These patterns in the data may be so specific that some scholars argue the model can “memorize” the training data.The model will then be able to answer prompts from users reflecting the patterns it has learned (for an LLM, answering questions in very convincing human-sounding language).There important implications for copyright law in both the inputs (training data) and outputs of these models, so let’s take a closer look.Training Data and Model OutputTraining data is vital to creating generative AI models. The objective is to teach a model to replicate human creativity, so the model needs to see huge volumes of works of human creativity in order to learn what that looks/sounds like. But, as we learned earlier, works that humans create belong to those humans (even if they are jotted down on a napkin). Paying every creator for the rights to their work is financially infeasible for the volumes of data we need to train even a small generative AI model. So, is it fair use for us to feed other people’s work into a training data set and create generative AI models? Let’s go over the Fair Use tests and see where we land.The purpose and character of the second useWe could argue that using data to train the model doesn’t really count as creating a derivative work. For example, is this different from teaching a child using a book or a piece of music? The counter arguments are first, that teaching one child is not the same as using millions of books to generate a product for profit, and second, that generative AI is so keenly able to reproduce content that it’s trained on, that it’s basically a big fancy tool for copying work almost verbatim. Is the result of generative AI sometimes innovative and totally different from the inputs? If it is, that’s probably because of very creative prompt engineering, but does that mean the underlying tool is legal?Philosophically, however, machine learning is trying to reproduce the patterns it has learned from its training data as accurately and precisely as possible. Are the patterns it learns from original works the same as the “heart” of the original works?2. The nature of the originalThis varies widely across the different kinds of generative AI that exist, but because of the sheer volumes of data required to train any model, it seems likely that at least some of it would fit the legal criteria for creativity. In many cases, the whole reason for using human content as training data is to try and get innovative (highly diverse) inputs into the model. Unless someone’s going to go through the entire 1 trillion words for GPT-4 and decide which ones were or weren’t creative, I think this criteria is not met for fair use.3. Amount usedThis is kind of a similar issue to #2. Because, almost by definition generative AI training datasets use everything they can get their hands on, and the volume needs to be huge and comprehensive; there’s not really a “minimal necessary” amount of content.4. EffectFinally, the effect issue is a big sticking point for generative AI. I think we all know people who use ChatGPT or similar tools from time to time instead of searching for the answer to a question in an encyclopedia or newspaper. There is strong evidence that people use services like Dall-E to request visual works “in the style of [Artist Name Here]” despite some apparent efforts from these services to stop that. If the question is whether people will use the generative AI instead of paying the original creator, it certainly seems like that is happening in some sectors. And we can see that companies like Microsoft, Google, Meta, and OpenAI are making billions in valuation and revenue from generative AI, so they’re definitely not going to get an easy pass on this one.Copying as a Concept in ComputingI’d like to stop for a moment to talk about a tangential but important issue. Copyright law is not well equipped to handle computing generally, particularly software and digital artifacts. Copyright law was mostly created in an earlier world, where duplicating a vinyl record or republishing a book was a specialized and expensive task. But today, when anything on any computer can basically be copied in seconds with a click of the mouse, the whole idea of copying things is different from how it used to be. Also, keep in mind that installing any software counts as making a copy. A digital copy means something different in our culture than the kinds of copying that we had before computers. There are significant lines of questioning around how copyright should work in the digital era, because a lot of it no longer seems quite relevant. Have you ever copied a bit of code from GitHub or StackOverflow? I certainly have! Did you carefully scrutinize the content license to make sure it was reproducible for your use case? You should, but did you?New York Times v. OpenAINow that we have a general sense of the shape of this dilemma, how are creators and the law approaching the issue? I think the most interesting such case (there are many) is the one brought by the New York Times, because part of it gets at the meaning of copying in a way I think other cases fail to do.As I mentioned above, the act of duplicating a digital file is so incredibly ubiquitous and normal that it’s hard to imagine enforcing that copying a digital file (at least, without the intent to distribute that exact file to the global public in violation of other fair use tests) is a copyright infringement. I think this is where our attention needs to fall for the generative AI question — not just duplication, but effect on the culture and the market.Is generative AI actually making copies of content? E.g.,training data in, training data back out? The NYT has shown in its filings that you can get verbatim text of NYT articles out of ChatGPT, with very specific prompting. Because the NYT has a paywall, if this is true, it would seem to clearly violate the Effect test of Fair Use. So far, OpenAI’s response has been “well, you used many complicated prompts to ChatGPT to get those verbatim results”, which makes me wonder, is their argument that if the generative AI sometimes produces verbatim copies of content it was trained on, that’s not illegal? (Universal Music Group has filed a similar case related to music, arguing that the generative AI model Claude can reproduce lyrics to songs that are copyrighted nearly verbatim.)We are asking the courts to decide exactly how much and what kind of use of a copyrighted material is acceptable, and that is going to be challenging in this context — I tend to believe that using data for training should not be inherently problematic, but that the important question is how the model gets used and what effect that has.We tend to think of fair use as a single step, like quoting a paragraph in your article with citation. Our system has a body of legal thought that is well prepared for that scenario. But in generative AI, it’s more like two steps. To say that copyright is infringed, it seems to me that if the content gets used in training, it ALSO must be retrievable from the end model in a way that usurps the market for the original material. I don’t think you can separate out the quantity of input content used from the quantity that can be extracted verbatim as output. Is this actually true of ChatGPT, though? We are going to see what the courts think.Ars Technica, The Verge, TechDirtDMCAThere’s another interesting angle to these questions, which is whether or not DMCA (the Digital Millennium Copyright Act) has relevance here. You may be familiar with this law because it’s been used for decades to force social media platforms to remove music and film files that were published without the authorization of the copyright holder. The law was based on the idea that you can kind of go “whac-a-mole” with copyright violators, and get content removed one piece at a time. However, when it comes to training data sets, this obviously won’t fly—you’d need to retrain the entire model, at exorbitant cost in the case of most generative AI, removing the offending file or files from the training data. You could still use DMCA, in theory, to force the output of an offending model to be removed from a site, but proving which model produced the item will be a challenge. But that doesn’t get at the underlying issue of input+output as both being key to the infringement as I have described it.Questions of PowerIf these behaviors are in fact violating copyright, the courts still have to decide what to do about it. Lots of people argue that generative AI is “too big to fail” in a manner of speaking — they can’t abolish the practices that got us here, because everyone loves ChatGPT, right? Generative AI (we are told) is going to revolutionize [insert sector here]!While the question of whether copyright is violated still remains to be decided, I do feel like there should be consequences if it is. At what point do we stop forgiving powerful people and institutions who skirt the law or outright violate it, assuming it is easier to ask forgiveness than permission? It’s not entirely obvious. We would not have many innovations that we rely on today without some people behaving in this fashion, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s worth it. Is there a devaluation of the rule of law that comes from letting these situations pass by?Like many listeners of 99% Invisible these days, I’m reading The Power Broker by Robert Caro. Hearing about how Robert Moses handled questions of law in New York at the turn of the 20th century is fascinating, because his style of handling zoning laws seems reminiscent of the way Uber handled laws around livery drivers in early 2010’s San Francisco, and the way large companies building generative AI are dealing with copyright now. Instead of abiding by laws, they have taken the attitude that legal strictures don’t apply to them because what they are building is so important and valuable.I’m just not convinced that’s true, however. Each case is distinctive in some ways, of course, but the concept that a powerful man can decide that what he thinks is a good idea is inevitably more important than what anyone else thinks rubs me the wrong way. Generative AI may be useful, but to argue that it is more important than having a culturally vibrant and creative society seems disingenuous. The courts still have to decide whether generative AI is having a chilling effect on artists and creators, but the court cases being brought by those creators are arguing that it is.The FutureThe US Copyright Office is not ignoring these challenging problems, although they may be a little late to the party, but they have put out a recent blog post talking about their plans for content related to generative AI. However, it’s very short on specifics and only tells us that reports are forthcoming in the future. The three areas this department’s work is going to focus on are:“digital replicas”: basically deepfakes and digital twins of people (think stunt doubles and actors having to get scanned at work so they can be mimicked digitally)“copyrightability of works incorporating AI-generated material”“training AI models on copyrighted works”These are all important topics, and I hope the results will be thoughtful. (I’ll write about them once these reports come out.) I hope the policymakers engaged in this work will be well informed and technically skilled, because it could be very easy for a bureaucrat to make this whole situation worse with ill-advised new rules.Another future possibility is that ethical datasets will be developed for training. This is something already being done by some folks at HuggingFace in the form of a code dataset called The Stack. Could we do this sort of thing for other forms of content?ConclusionRegardless of what the government or industry comes up with, however, the courts are proceeding to decide this problem. What happens if one of the cases in the courts is lost by the generative AI side?It may at least mean that some of the money being produced by generative AI will be passed back to creators. I’m not terribly convinced that the whole idea of generative AI will disappear, although we did see the end of a lot of companies during the era of Napster. Courts could bankrupt companies producing generative AI, and/or ban the production of generative AI models — this is not impossible! I don’t think it’s the most likely outcome, however- instead, I think we’ll see some penalties and some fragmentation of the law around this (this model is ok, that model is not, and so on), which may or may not make the situation any clearer legally.I would really like it if the courts take up the question of when and how a generative AI model should be considered infringing, not separating the input and output questions but examining them together as a single whole, because I think that is key to understanding the situation. If they do, we might be able to come up with legal frameworks that make sense for the new technology we are dealing with. If not, I fear we’ll end up further into a quagmire of laws woefully unprepared to guide our digital innovations. We need copyright law that makes more sense in the context of our digital world. But we also need to intelligently protect human art and science and creativity in various forms, and I don’t think AI-generated content is worth trading that away.Read more of my content at www.stephaniekirmer.com.References and Additional ReadingTeaching CopyrightWelcomeThere's a lot of misinformation out there about legal rights and responsibilities in the digital era.This is…www.eff.orgLooking Forward: The U.S. Copyright Office’s AI Initiative in 2024 | CopyrightThis blog post previews the next steps of the U.S. Copyright Office’s comprehensive initiative to examine the copyright…blogs.loc.govThe scary truth about AI copyright is nobody knows what will happen nextGenerative AI models have taken off in 2022.

											Skills Needed to Work Effectively with Artificial Intelligence

Many employees and managers are excited about how AI can make their work easier and more efficient. But others are concerned that AI will replace people, dampen creativity and ingenuity, make their own skills obsolete, and create workplaces that feel more machine-centric and less human.
While many fear AI will make our workplaces soulless, research suggests that it could actually push us to improve our human-centered soft skills. Workers and companies need to be intentional about cultivating these skills, which are often more difficult to master, harder to measure, and frequently get pushed aside in favor of technical skill sets. The latest research shows that in the AI age, employers expect to increasingly value “soft skills” that enhance human interactions and foster rich, people-centered company cultures. They anticipate that AI will work best when it enhances people’s talents and helps build human connectedness.
Studies reveal two categories of human skills that leaders see as critical — and which organizations are actually teaching to their employees.

Effective interpersonal skills, such as basic conflict resolution, communication, skills of disconnecting from emotions, and even mindfulness practices.
Domain expertise, with a focus on preserving that knowledge among experienced talent and developing it among young inexperienced workers.


 
BGSF staffing firm asked their 218K+ LinkedIn followers to vote on the soft skills they believe will be most important in the workplace in 2024. Here’s what they discovered…

Poll Question: “Which soft skills are most important in the AI-dominated workplace?”





Critical Thinking (47%)
It’s not a surprise that critical thinking received the most votes (47%), as this is a uniquely human skill requiring logic, rational thinking, and unbiased evaluation. According to Fast Company, critical thinking is a necessary skill to evaluate generative AI responses which could contain biases and errors from the vast amounts of patterns and structures in data processing. Employees with the skills to critically assess, question, and filter AI outputs will make the human-AI collaboration a more successful partnership.



Emotional Intelligence (23%)
According to Forbes Advisor, emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize and understand your own emotions and the emotions of others. Emotional intelligence ranked 2nd in the BGSF poll and becomes increasingly important when navigating social dynamics in an ever-evolving global workplace. 



Creativity (18%)
Creativity came in third, receiving (18%) of the votes. The ability to be creative is an essential skill for effective problem-solving. Creative thinkers often tackle issues from fresh perspectives. According to Forbes Advisor, creative soft skills include brainstorming, imagination, curiosity, and experimentation. According to a study by Hendarman and Cantner, developing soft skills such as creativity and problem-solving may lead to new ideas and services that add value and solve problems, helping the team members and overall organization be more successful.



Unbiased Decision Making (12%)
Although this category came in last (12%), it’s important to note that unbiased decision-making is a uniquely human skill requiring rational thinking, reflective consideration, and the ability to ensure that any AI deployed aligns with your organization’s values and is never used in ways that could be harmful or unjust. This skill will become even more important as AI continues to evolve and impact the workplace.
If done thoughtfully, a renewed focus on soft skills could result in vastly improved workplaces where human connection, strong values, rich communication, and dynamic innovation abound. AI is challenging us to confront many complex workplace issues—and the possibilities for success and new opportunities are endless if handled with care. It’s on us to decide whether we will let AI enhance or diminish the uniquely valuable skills and connections that make us human.

Starting from writing assignments to submitting an important ppt for your company, AI is everywhere. But, is it really eating up all the job opportunities? 

AI is used for the benefits of humans, it's not here to replace them. But, a US survey says that 10% of US workers can lose their job due to the much interference of AI, and this problem is emerging exponentially to the lower class less educated people who are working for a very low salary. 

The report also says that 20% of employees are in jobs with 'high exposure', so the way they used to work can change due to the interference of AI

But, we have to understand the fact that AI can only make facts easier. If you see closely, AI can drive a car, AI can write articles and Ai can also generate big thesis papers. But, in order to fact check we have to take human help. 

Even if AI is driving the car there needs to be a real human behind it who is going to supervise it. Otherwise the AI can sometime glitch causing an accident. 

In cases of thesis papers a person has to check it before sharing it to the higher authority because, an AI lacks empathy and it lacks correct sentence structure. So to correct an AI generated text one human has to be there.

Starting from writing assignments to submitting an important ppt for your company, AI is everywhere. But, is it really eating up all the job opportunities? 

AI is used for the benefits of humans, it's not here to replace them. But, a US survey says that 10% of US workers can lose their job due to the much interference of AI, and this problem is emerging exponentially to the lower class less educated people who are working for a very low salary. 

The report also says that 20% of employees are in jobs with 'high exposure', so the way they used to work can change due to the interference of AI

But, we have to understand the fact that AI can only make facts easier. If you see closely, AI can drive a car, AI can write articles and Ai can also generate big thesis papers. But, in order to fact check we have to take human help. 

Even if AI is driving the car there needs to be a real human behind it who is going to supervise it. Otherwise the AI can sometime glitch causing an accident. 

In cases of thesis papers a person has to check it before sharing it to the higher authority because, an AI lacks empathy and it lacks correct sentence structure. So to correct an AI generated text one human has to be there. 

Along with artificial intelligence a professional who knows the skills is also needed to excel in the work. As of now artificial intelligence can't manage people or raise the capital required to establish business.

Might Benefit the Middle ClassDavid Autor, an M.I.T. economist and tech contrarian, argues that A.I. is fundamentally different from past waves of computerization.Share full articleRead in app“A.I., if used well, can assist with restoring the middle-skill, middle-class heart of the U.S. labor market,” David Autor, a labor economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wrote.Credit...Ryan Christopher Jones for The New York TimesBy Steve LohrApril 1, 2024David Autor seems an unlikely A.I. optimist. The labor economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is best known for his in-depth studies showing how much technology and trade have eroded the incomes of millions of American workers over the years.But Mr. Autor is now making the case that the new wave of technology — generative artificial intelligence, which can produce hyper-realistic images and video and convincingly imitate humans’ voices and writing — could reverse that trend.“A.I., if used well, can assist with restoring the middle-skill, middle-class heart of the U.S. labor market that has been hollowed out by automation and globalization,” Mr. Autor wrote in a paper that Noema Magazine published in February.Mr. Autor’s stance on A.I. looks like a stunning conversion for a longtime expert on technology’s work force casualties. But he said the facts had changed and so had his thinking. AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTModern A.I., Mr. Autor said, is a fundamentally different technology, opening the door to new possibilities. It can, he continued, change the economics of high-stakes decision-making so more people can take on some of the work that is now the province of elite, and expensive, experts like doctors, lawyers, software engineers and college professors. And if more people, including those without college degrees, can do more valuable work, they should be paid more, lifting more workers into the middle class.The researcher, whom The Economist once called “the academic voice of the American worker,” started his career as a software developer and a leader of a computer-education nonprofit before switching to economics — and spending decades examining the impact of technology and globalization on workers and wages.Mr. Autor, 59, was an author of an influential study in 2003 that concluded that 60 percent of the shift in demand favoring college-educated workers over the previous three decades was attributable to computerization. Later research examined the role of technology in wage polarization and in skewing employment growth toward low-wage service jobs.Other economists view Mr. Autor’s latest treatise as a stimulating, though speculative, thought exercise.“I’m a great admirer of David Autor’s work, but his hypothesis is only one possible scenario,” said Laura Tyson, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, who was chair of the Council of Economic Advisers during the Clinton administration. “There is broad agreement that A.I. will produce a productivity benefit, but how that translates into wages and employment is very uncertain.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThat uncertainty usually veers toward pessimism. Not just Silicon Valley doomsayers, but mainstream economists predict that many jobs, from call center workers to software developers, are at risk. In a report last year, Goldman Sachs concluded that generative A.I. could automate activities equivalent to 300 million full-time jobs globally.ImageA call center in Montgomery, Ala. A research project by two M.I.T. graduate students that Mr. Autor advised, showed that A.I. increased the productivity of all workers, but the less skilled benefited the most.Credit...Bob Miller for The New York TimesIn Mr. Autor’s latest report, which was also published in the National Bureau of Economic Research, he discounts the likelihood that A.I. can replace human judgment entirely. And he sees the demand for health care, software, education and legal advice as almost limitless, so that lowering costs should expand those fields as their products and services become more widely affordable.It’s “not a forecast but an argument” for an alternative path ahead, very different from the jobs apocalypse foreseen by Elon Musk, among others, he said.Until now, Mr. Autor said, computers were programmed to follow rules. They relentlessly got better, faster and cheaper. And routine tasks, in an office or a factory, could be reduced to a series of step-by-step rules that have increasingly been automated. Those jobs were typically done by middle-skill workers without four-year college degrees.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTA.I., by contrast, is trained on vast troves of data — virtually all the text, images and software code on the internet. When prompted, powerful A.I. chatbots like Open AI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini can generate reports and computer programs or answer questions.“It doesn’t know rules,” Mr. Autor said. “It learns by absorbing lots and lots of examples. It’s completely different from what we had in computing.”An A.I. helper, he said, equipped with a storehouse of learned examples can offer “guidance” (in health care, did you consider this diagnosis?) and “guardrails” (don’t prescribe these two drugs together).In that way, Mr. Autor said, A.I. becomes not a job killer but a “worker complementary technology,” which enables someone without as much expertise to do more valuable work.Early studies of generative A.I. in the workplace point to the potential. One research project by two M.I.T. graduate students, whom Mr. Autor advised, assigned tasks like writing short reports or news releases to office professionals. A.I. increased the productivity of all workers, but the less skilled and experienced benefited the most. Later research with call center workers and computer programmers found a similar pattern.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTBut even if A.I. delivers the largest productivity gains to less-experienced workers, that does not mean they will reap the rewards of higher pay and better career paths. That will also depend on corporate behavior, worker bargaining power and policy incentives.Daron Acemoglu, an M.I.T. economist and occasional collaborator of Mr. Autor’s, said his colleague’s vision is one possible path ahead, but not necessarily the most likely one. History, Mr. Acemoglu said, is not with the lift-all-boats optimists.“We’ve been here before with other digital technologies, and it hasn’t happened,” he said.Mr. Autor acknowledges the challenges. “But I do think there is value in imagining a positive outcome, encouraging debate and preparing for a better future,” he said. “This technology is a tool, and how we decide to use it is up to us.”Steve Lohr writes about technology and its impact on the economy, jobs and the workplace.

As AI continues to permeate business life, companies are starting to ask themselves if they need AI expertise at the C-suite level.
According to LinkedIn, the number of companies with a “Head of AI” position has more than tripled in the last five years, and is up 13% since 2022. 
Chief AI Officers (CAIOs) are “brought in to really align an organization’s AI strategy and goals, depending on the existing roles and business need,” said Anne Yarovoy Khan, of counsel in the Fisher Phillips’ Irvine office, and a member of the firm’s AI, privacy and cyber, and PEO and staffing practice groups.
Not every company will need to jump in and have an AI executive at the C-suite level, but AI executives are becoming more commonplace. Here’s what HR professionals need to know.

The employee benefits that matter in 2024

With the uncertainty brought on by the pandemic, employers are further customizing benefits to both attract and retain employees. Discover which priorities HR leaders are focusing on in this Trendline. 








The CAIO role isn’t defined, but requires a certain set of skills
Right now, the role of the CAIO is new and may not be well defined. But a CAIO can do a number of things, Khan said, including developing AI strategy with “a look to longer term objectives, including where the organization is going.” They can also oversee AI governance, consider privacy-related aspects of AI, mitigate risk of AI deployment, oversee training and education on AI, and ensure transparency in AI use.
This person can’t just be a technical whiz, she added. Knowledge of AI is required, but the CAIO will need to team up with others across the organization “to effectively execute strategy and ensuring compliance as well,” she said, adding that an ideal CAIO would “stay on top of the changing landscape of AI, bring in executive leadership and work cross functionally.” 
Since executive-level AI pros are still relatively new, finding the right person for these jobs, or even knowing what they’ll do, will take some time. That’s why it’s key they have the right skills to execute on whatever those goals may be.
“Historically, jobs were defined by titles. But the smart companies are realizing they need to start defining the job as a collection of skills and tasks, not simply titles,” Ryan Roslansky, CEO of Linkedin said at Talent Connect in October 2023. “Then start thinking about how those tasks are required to change as AI continues to advance, and then what new skills we require to succeed.”
Determining what level executive an AI pro should be
While the title CAIO itself is a buzzword right now, that doesn’t mean every organization needs someone elevated to that high of an executive level.

Sal DiFranco, managing partner of the global advanced technology practice for DHR Global, said there’s more talk about a senior vice president or vice president of AI. He likened it to about 10 years ago when clients were looking to hire IoT experts at that level, and they went on to report to the CIO or CTO.
A VP or SVP of AI will make sense for a lot of companies, he added, and they’ll most likely also report to the CIO or CTO. “They’re the ones with the technology and know what’s happening in the space.” 
DiFranco recently interviewed a CISO candidate for a large retail company that is starting their AI initiative and leadership council in the CIO and CTO office, he said. The person in the job will the point person to lead the strategy on finding a leader for the organization, and most likely it will be an SVP or C-level reporting to the CIO.
Most of his clients looking for AI executives are looking for candidates who are experts in AI of course, but also machine and deep learning, he said. They also might need experience in robotics depending on the kind of company they’d be working for, he added, like those in manufacturing. 
Having leadership skills and being able to explain technical topics to a non-tech audience will also make for successful AI executives. “They have to be somebody who understands how to navigate an organization and all functions in an organization. Is it HR, is it finance, is it sales, is it technology?” DiFranco said. They need to be able to talk to stakeholders across the organization about how AI will impact their function or line of business. “Those influence skills,” he said, “are absolutely critical.”

The advancements in technology have sparked debates and raised important questions about the impact of AI on our daily lives. Is it the 21st century’s version of the Industrial Revolution? How will it shape the future of work? These are crucial inquiries that demand attention.In the early months of 2023, the Washington Post stated that the AI “gold rush” had arrived. Major companies like Alphabet and Microsoft made significant job cuts to invest billions of dollars in generative artificial intelligence. This wave of excitement followed the release of ChatGPT, an AI-based chatbot system, in late 2022. The potential of AI seemed boundless.However, amidst the hype, there are several key takeaways. Firstly, it’s essential to recognize that AI is already deeply embedded in our lives. A study conducted by Sam Ransbotham, a professor of analytics at Boston College, revealed that most people are already using AI in some form, even if they are unaware of it. GPS systems and spell check tools are just a few examples of the everyday AI-powered tools that people rely on. The pervasive nature of AI is often unnoticed but undeniable.Ransbotham also highlighted the competitive advantage that AI offers. It is not about “robots” taking away jobs, but rather about individuals who can adapt and embrace AI technology. Those who can effectively utilize AI in their work will not only remain employed but also outperform their peers. On an organizational level, companies that fail to leverage AI run the risk of widespread job losses and financial collapse. The potential impact is significant.While AI-powered tools hold tremendous potential for improving skills, enhancing learning environments, and refining various industries, including healthcare and education, there are also notable concerns. Ransbotham highlighted that relying too heavily on AI can hinder the development of general skills. For instance, using AI from the outset in essay writing eliminates the important process of learning through mistakes. The long-term consequences of such reliance on AI are yet to be fully understood.Another critical issue is the lack of regulation in the AI industry. Companies developing generative AI tools operate with little oversight or transparency. The absence of control raises questions about who runs these tools and what their objectives may be. Ransbotham likened this situation to the unregulated meatpacking industry of the early 20th century, which ultimately necessitated the creation of the Food and Drug Administration. Governments must consider effective regulations for AI to ensure ethical and responsible use.Ultimately, Ransbotham emphasized that AI tools are neutral and their usage depends on humans. Drawing an analogy between AI and the discovery of rocks by cavemen, he explained that it is up to individuals to decide whether these tools will be used as weapons or as instruments for progress. The critical factor now is how governments and individuals choose to manage and harness the potential of  AI going forward.In conclusion, AI is already shaping our lives and work environments. It presents both incredible opportunities and notable challenges. Understanding the impact of AI and effectively managing its implementation will be crucial in shaping a future that benefits everyone.

This is how the new platform Siisl (Information System for Social and Work Inclusion) works, established at the Ministry of Labour and Social Policies and managed by the National Social Security Institute (Inps). AI is applied experimentally to the beneficiaries of the Training and Work Support (SFL) and the Inclusion Income (ADI), who access the platform in the work activation process, to find job offers that are more suited to their professional profile. The System is able to calculate a 'compatibility index' of the job offers on Siisl with each curriculum vitae. This is, in fact, an indicative indicator that represents the level of compatibility between the curriculum vitae and the selected job offer, in order to simplify the user's interaction with the database. The compatibility index is based on machine learning algorithms, capable of processing natural language and evaluating the semantic proximity between the textual fields present in the job offer and those exposed in the curriculum vitae. 'With the application of AI - states the General Manager of Inps, Vincenzo Caridi - the system wanted by Minister Marina Calderone provides citizens and Employment Agencies with a powerful tool that facilitates the concrete search for employment. The next steps we will take, in collaboration with the Ministry of Labour, Sviluppo Lavoro Italia, and Inapp, will be aimed at improving the matching and the quality of training courses through the use of updated skill maps, applied at national and European level (e.g., Atlante, Esco) and through the comparison between the skills required by the market and those offered by the training.'

These individuals, originally hired to train algorithms, often end up shouldering the responsibility of executing much of the AI’s tasks. A recent report by The Information shed light on these vital workers, particularly in the context of Amazon’s Just Walk Out technology. This technology, which allowed customers to conveniently grab grocery items from store shelves and exit without the need for traditional checkouts, had been reliant on over 1,000 individuals in India who diligently watched and labeled videos to ensure accurate checkouts.While Amazon highlights on its website the employment of “computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning” in Just Walk Out, it fails to make mention of these offshore contractors. When questioned, Amazon clarified that these workers were simply annotating videos to enhance the system and only validated a small fraction of shopping visits when the  AI systems were incapable of determining a purchase.This revelation from Amazon serves as a stark reminder that the effective functioning of “artificial intelligence” often hinges upon the presence of human overseers. In fact, Amazon itself has an entire business unit called Amazon Turk, which assists other companies in training and operating their own  AI systems. Countless freelancers across the globe identify themselves as “M-Turkers,” and the unit draws its name from the renowned tale of the Mechanical Turk, an 18th-century chess-playing automaton steered covertly by a concealed human controller.The prevalence of humans laboring behind the scenes of seemingly advanced  AI technology extends well beyond Amazon’s case. Numerous other companies have failed to disclose their reliance on human involvement in driving their supposedly cutting-edge AI systems. Facebook, for instance, shut down its text-based virtual assistant M in 2018 after two years of operation, during which human workers were extensively utilized to train and operate its underlying  AI system. Similarly, a startup named x.ai, which boasted an “AI personal assistant” for scheduling meetings, was compelled to cease operations in 2021 as it encountered difficulties in achieving true algorithmic autonomy.Another example is the British startup Builder.ai, which marketed AI software capable of building apps but relied partly on software developers in India and elsewhere to fulfill that task, as reported by The Wall Street Journal.This reality underscores the fine line between the anticipation of algorithmic replacement and utilizing human workers as a temporary solution—an approach often justified by marketers under the guise of eventual automation. Such “pseudo AI” or “AI washing” was prevalent even prior to the recent surge of generative  AI technologies.For instance, West Monroe Partners, a firm specializing in due diligence for private equity firms, examined marketing material provided by 40 US firms up for sale in 2019. The analysis revealed that these companies exaggerated their technology’s capabilities in the realm of  AI and machine learning by an average of over 30%. Along similar lines, MMC, a London-based venture capital firm, discovered that out of 2,830 European startups classified as AI companies, only 1,580 legitimately aligned with that description.One of the obvious concerns arising from the involvement of humans in AI is the potential invasion of privacy. Amazon’s utilization of “supervised learning” in its  AI systems prompted thousands of contractors to listen in on individuals’ commands to Alexa. However, the proliferation of misleading claims in the AI industry also poses risks.Fortunately, regulators are stepping up their efforts to address this issue and hold companies accountable for misleading  AI claims. Ismail Ramsey, the US attorney for the Northern District of California, recently announced his intention to target startups that deceive investors regarding their usage of AI before going public. Additionally, in February, the Chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, warned that AI washing could violate securities laws. Subsequently, two investment firms reached settlements totaling $400,000 with the SEC for overstating their employment of  AI.Even in cases where AI systems are accurately represented, it is crucial to recognize the existence of a vast industry of hidden workers supporting many high-tech AI systems, often receiving minimal compensation. Esteemed academics like Kate Crawford and authors like Madhumita’s Code Dependent have extensively documented this phenomenon, shedding light on the realities of  AI beyond the glamour and hype.FAQQ: What is “AI washing”?
A: “AI washing” refers to the practice of leveraging the hype and ambiguity surrounding AI to exaggerate the capabilities of a technology that is not entirely AI-driven.Q: How are regulators addressing misleading AI claims?
A: Regulators, such as the US attorney for the Northern District of California and the Chair of the SEC, are actively targeting startups and companies that mislead investors about their use and capabilities of  AI, with the intention of imposing penalties and enforcing transparency.Q: What are some examples of companies relying on human labor for  AI tasks?
A: Facebook, x.ai, and Builder.ai are among the companies that employed human workers instead of fully autonomous algorithms for tasks related to their AI systems.Sources:
– The Information – [source_link_1]
– Wall Street Journal – [source_link_2]
– Code Dependent by Madhumita – [source_link_3]In addition to the revelations about Amazon’s reliance on human workers for its AI technology, it is important to understand the wider industry landscape, market forecasts, and key issues related to the industry and its products.The  AI industry is experiencing significant growth and is expected to continue expanding in the coming years. Market research firm Tractica forecasts that  AI software revenue will reach $105.8 billion by 2025, a substantial increase from $9.5 billion in 2018. This growth is driven by the increasing adoption of AI across various sectors, including healthcare, finance, retail, and manufacturing.However, the reliance on human labor in AI systems raises ethical and transparency concerns. Many companies, including Amazon, Facebook, x.ai, and Builder.ai, have been found to conceal the extent of human involvement in their AI operations. This lack of transparency not only misrepresents the capabilities of  AI systems but also raises privacy concerns, as seen in the case of Amazon’s contractors listening to Alexa commands.Regulators are taking steps to address these issues and hold companies accountable for misleading  AI claims. The US attorney for the Northern District of California has expressed intentions to target startups that deceive investors about their use of AI before going public. The Chair of the SEC has also warned that AI washing could violate securities laws, resulting in enforcement actions and settlements with investment firms that overstated their AI capabilities.The concept of “AI washing” has emerged as a notable concern.  AI washing refers to the practice of exaggerating the capabilities of a technology that is not entirely AI-driven, leveraging the hype and ambiguity surrounding AI. This phenomenon was prevalent even before the recent surge of generative  AI technologies. Studies have shown that companies often overstate their technology’s capabilities in AI and machine learning, with some European startups misrepresenting themselves as AI companies.It is crucial to recognize the existence of a vast industry of hidden workers supporting many high-tech AI systems, often receiving minimal compensation. These workers, such as the M-Turkers in Amazon’s case, play a crucial role in training and operating  AI systems. Researchers and authors have extensively documented this phenomenon, shedding light on the realities of AI beyond the glamour and hype. Works like Kate Crawford’s research and Madhumita’s book “Code Dependent” offer valuable insights into the hidden workforce behind  AI.Overall, while the AI industry continues to advance, it is important to address issues related to human involvement, misleading claims, privacy, and transparency. Regulators, researchers, and authors are working to bring attention to these concerns and hold companies accountable for their actions.Sources:

Ben & Jerry’s grocery store freezers. Abercrombie & Fitch’s marketing. Many mainstays of the American customer experience are increasingly powered by artificial intelligence.The question is whether the technology will actually make companies more efficient.Rapid productivity improvement is the dream for both companies and economic policymakers. If output per hour holds steady, firms must either sacrifice profits or raise prices to pay for wage increases or investment projects. But when firms figure out how to produce more per working hour, it means that they can maintain or expand profits even as they pay or invest more. Economies experiencing productivity booms can experience rapid wage gains and quick growth without as much risk of rapid inflation.But many economists and officials seem dubious that A.I. — especially generative A.I., which is still in its infancy — has spread enough to show up in productivity data already.Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, recently suggested that A.I. “may” have the potential to increase productivity growth, “but probably not in the short run.” John C. Williams, president of the New York Fed, has made similar remarks, specifically citing the work of the Northwestern University economist Robert Gordon.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMr. Gordon has argued that new technologies in recent years, while important, have probably not been transformative enough to give a lasting lift to productivity growth.“The enthusiasm about large language models and ChatGPT has gone a bit overboard,” he said in an interview.The last time productivity really picked up, in the 1990s, computer manufacturing was getting a lot more efficient at the same time that computers themselves were making everything else more efficient — allowing for a sector-spanning productivity increase. Today’s gains may be less broad, he thinks.Other economists are more optimistic. Erik Brynjolfsson at Stanford University has bet Mr. Gordon $400 that productivity will take off this decade. His optimism is based partly on A.I. He ran an experiment with it at a large call center, where it especially helped less experienced workers, and has co-founded a company meant to teach firms how to leverage the technology.Many companies seem to be in Mr. Brynjolfsson’s camp, hopeful that the shiny new tool will revolutionize their workplaces. Companies are using A.I. and generative A.I. for everything from writing marketing emails to helping set prices to answering employees’ human resources and legal questions.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTHere are a few areas where companies say the latest A.I. technology is being used in ways that could influence productivity, pulled from interviews, earnings calls and financial filings.Got an annoying task? There’s an A.I. for that.Employees spend a lot of time trying to figure out human-resources-related questions. Companies have been investing in generative A.I. to help answer those queries more quickly.At Walmart, the largest retailer in the United States, with 1.6 million workers, the company’s employee app has a section called “My Assistant,” which is backed by generative A.I. The feature uses the technology to quickly answer questions like “Do I have dental coverage?,” summarize meeting notes and help write job descriptions.Walmart rolled out the technology to its U.S. corporate work force last year. The retailer has been clear that the tool is meant to boost productivity. In an interview last year, Donna Morris, Walmart’s chief people officer, said one of the goals was to eliminate some mundane work so employees could focus on tasks that had more impact. It’s expected to be a “huge productivity lift” for the company, she said.

Behind the JournalismOur business coverage. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.Here’s more on our standards and practices.The algorithms want to sell you things.Tony Spring, Macy’s chief executive, said the department-store chain was experimenting with A.I. to tailor its marketing. The company is using generative A.I. to write elements of emails, and is exploring ways to use the technology to add product descriptions online and to replicate images of outfits or other products for sale over new backgrounds.“It’s certainly showing up as a tool for some colleagues to reduce workload,” Mr. Spring said in an interview.Abercrombie & Fitch is using generative A.I. to help design clothes and write descriptions for its website and app. Designers use Midjourney, an A.I. graphics program, to help them generate images as they brainstorm clothing ideas. Workers in Abercrombie’s marketing department also use generative A.I. to help write the blurbs for products’ descriptions. (Employees later edit the copy.)Samir Desai, Abercrombie & Fitch’s chief digital officer, said the technology helped speed up a laborious process, given that Abercrombie and its brands could post a couple of hundred new products on its website in a single week.“I think right now it’s a lot of trust and belief that these are productivity enhancers, efficiency boosters,” Mr. Desai said, noting that it was difficult to quantify how much time and money was being saved. “I think we’ll start to see that manifest itself in just how much work certain teams are able to get through versus the prior years.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTA.I. pairs well with burgers and ice cream.Some companies are hoping to use the latest A.I. technology to help match prices to demand, somewhat like the way that Uber sets prices for cars based on how many people want to ride.Wendy’s, for instance, has floated the idea of using A.I. to identify slower times of the day and discount the prices of menu items on its digital boards.The technology could also help with inventory management. Ben & Jerry’s put cameras that use A.I. into the freezers at grocery stores to help alert the company when a location was running low on pints of Cherry Garcia or Chunky Monkey. The camera sporadically captures an image of the freezer shelves, and the technology assesses the quantity that’s left, sending alerts to Ben & Jerry’s parent company and its distributors.“The software identifies what is about to run out and also helps plan the most efficient routes for trucks that can restock the inventory,” Catherine Reynolds, a spokeswoman for Unilever, the parent of Ben & Jerry’s, said in a statement.The A.I. technology is installed in 8,000 freezers, and the company said it planned to significantly increase that number this year. On average, freezers with the A.I. technology increased sales 13 percent because they were replenished with fresh pints of ice cream, particularly the most in-demand flavors, Ms. Reynolds said.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTA.I. is getting into the weeds.Deere, the maker of farm equipment, has been using A.I. alongside cameras to improve herbicide sprayers. The equipment recognizes and targets weeds specifically, allowing for more precise use of chemicals. The technology was introduced in 2022, and the company estimates that it covered 100 million acres and saved eight million gallons of herbicide last year.The technology can allow “customers to reduce their herbicide use, lower their costs and minimize impact on their crops and land,” John C. May II, the firm’s chief executive, said at a news conference in February.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAre these game-changing improvements?Skepticism of A.I.’s potential for major change is based largely on the fact that many of its applications mimic things software can already do: There are clear improvements, but not necessarily game-changing ones.But while it could take time for companies to fully harness A.I. tools, the fact that the applications are potentially so broad has made some economists optimistic about what the new technologies could mean for productivity growth.Analysts at Vanguard think that A.I. could be “transformative” to the U.S. economy in the second half of the 2020s, said Joseph Davis, the financial firm’s global chief economist. He said the technology could save workers meaningful time — perhaps 20 percent — in about 80 percent of occupations.“We’re not seeing it in the data yet,” he said, explaining that he thinks that a recent pickup in productivity has been more of a snapback from a steep drop-off during the pandemic. “The good news is that there’s another wave coming.”Jordyn Holman is a business reporter for The Times, covering the retail industry and consumer behavior.

AI training revolution: Upskilling for a new era

        A recent Coursera for Business webinar explored how generative AI can be leveraged for workforce development and training.

In today’s rapidly evolving business landscape, the role of HR professionals has expanded beyond traditional functions like recruitment and talent management. With the advent of transformative technologies like Generative AI (GenAI), HR leaders are increasingly tasked with driving innovation and facilitating continuous learning and development within their organisations.
Coursera for Business, in collaboration with HRM Asia, recently hosted a webinar aimed at empowering HR professionals with the knowledge and strategies to harness GenAI for workforce development. The former’s GenAI Academy offers structured training programmes designed to bridge the skills gap and equip employees with the capabilities needed to thrive in a GenAI-powered world.
Amandeep Singh Kohli, Regional Director – Asia at Coursera, emphasised the importance of keeping people at the core of any GenAI strategy. “GenAI is a tool in your arsenal to make sure that you become more productive,” he said. This human-centric approach is crucial for successful GenAI implementation, he continued, adding that GenAI should not be seen as a replacement for human employees but rather as a way to augment their skills and make them more effective.
The webinar featured a panel discussion moderated by Shawn Liew, Head of Content Development for HRM Asia. Titled Building an Effective Skills Programme to Improve Employee Productivity and Performance with Generative AI, the discussion included representatives from organisations like Singtel and Maybank.
Datuk Dr Nora Manaf, Group Chief Human Capital Officer at Maybank, shared insights into Maybank’s experience with GenAI implementation to provide a compelling narrative of the organisation’s proactive approach to embracing this transformative technology. She underscored the importance of effective communication, literacy-building initiatives, and tangible business outcomes driven by GenAI adoption.
Datuk Nora’s emphasis on demystifying GenAI sets the tone for Maybank’s approach to technology adoption. “Demystifying is the first thing that we do,” she explained, highlighting the bank’s commitment to bringing all employees to a minimum level of literacy and understanding. This disciplined approach ensures that Maybank’s workforce is equipped with the necessary knowledge to embrace GenAI’s potential fully.
Furthermore, she elaborated on Maybank’s literacy-building initiatives, emphasising the importance of establishing a baseline of understanding of GenAI concepts. “We offer a self-administered assessment to help employees gauge their understanding of basic terms. It’s not intended for reporting purposes, but rather for self-evaluation,” she shared.
Datuk Nora’s anecdote about Maybank’s use cases further illustrates the tangible impact of GenAI on business outcomes. She cited an example of a pilot programme where they used ChatGPT technology to train salespeople. “The results were impressive,” she said, “with the GenAI-trained group achieving nearly three times the sales realisation compared to the traditionally trained group.” This demonstrates the tangible benefits that GenAI can bring to employee productivity and performance.
Simon Wong, Associate Director of People Development at Singtel, echoed the sentiment. “GenAI democratises access to technology,” he asserted, capturing the essence of GenAI’s transformative power. He highlighted how GenAI transcends traditional communication barriers, enabling anyone proficient in a language to leverage its capabilities. Wong’s remarks underscore how GenAI facilitates inclusivity by empowering all individuals from all backgrounds, including primary school students, to utilise its tools in educational settings.
In the context of Singtel’s utilisation of GenAI, Wong elaborated on the diverse applications within the organisation. He discussed how departments with the requisite skills harness GenAI to develop chatbots and applications tailored to internal employees and external stakeholders. This approach underscored Singtel’s commitment to leveraging GenAI to enhance operational efficiency and customer experience.
Moreover, Wong emphasised Singtel’s comprehensive training interventions designed to cater to different learner categories. These interventions include role-based training, broad-based training for a larger population, and self-paced learning via an e-learning platform. By offering various learning modules, Singtel ensures that employees acquire a fundamental understanding of GenAI, empowering them to leverage its capabilities effectively.
The success stories shared during the webinar highlight the importance of a well-defined GenAI implementation strategy. Coursera’s Kohli aptly summarised the current state of GenAI adoption within organisations as a “GenAI conundrum”. Leaders face a dilemma: the potential benefits of GenAI are undeniable, but the fear of technical risks and data security concerns can lead to hesitation.
However, the potential of GenAI far outweighs the risks, he said. “Leaders with access to better technologies are well-positioned to navigate this change effectively. Just like a Formula One race car needs good brakes alongside its powerful engine, organisations must balance rapid innovation with high-quality training and data security measures.”

Coursera recognises this challenge and offers structured training programmes to help organisations equip their workforce with the necessary skills and knowledge. “We understand this risk of moving too fast, the risk of moving too slow,” Kohli acknowledged. “But while you’re navigating all of these, Coursera offers a structured training programme for you to take so that eventually when all of these regulatory concerns go away your employees can be productive as quickly as you want them.”
The future of work will be shaped by GenAI. By embracing this technology and prioritising a human-centric approach to training, organisations can navigate the GenAI conundrum with confidence, Kohli suggested. With careful planning and a focus on employee development, organisations can leverage GenAI to build a futureproof workforce that is prepared to thrive in the age of intelligent automation.

Adaptation of this technology is becoming increasingly important in any country, particularly one developing artificial intelligence. In collaboration with the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, Robotics Association Nepal, and a myriad of local partners, The Asia Foundation held the “Conference on Artificial Intelligence for Prosperous Nepal” on March 3, emphasizing the future of work. The conference focused on the ethics, practicality, and developmental implications of AI for Nepal’s AI technology sector. National and international experts were in attendance to participate in critical discussions, present their research, work on AI and robotics, and deliver keynote speeches. Attendees explored various facets of AI, including its policy implications in relation to national development and its potential applications in the market. Breakout sessions featured presentations from tech experts on combating misinformation and disinformation. The final panel discussion focused on strategies to accelerate the Nepali innovation industry through AI. Following the conference, the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology (MoEST) delivered its resolution on the country’s AI policy framework. This framework will be shared with partner organizations, stakeholders, and participants for input. The Ministry aims to align the policy with national development goals to foster more innovation in various sectors with government support and existing frameworks that enable research to transform fields like healthcare. The resolution from MoEST stresses collaboration, capacity building, meaningful public service, and the integration of artificial intelligence into education, agriculture, and the industrial sector, among other things. It also emphasizes the necessity of continuous research and innovation to ensure Nepal stays ahead in the rapidly evolving field while also emphasizing the importance of ethical considerations and data privacy in the development and implementation of AI technologies.",N/A,https://schema.org,"[{'@type': 'Article', '@id': 'https://asiafoundation.org/2024/04/04/future-of-work-in-nepal-conference-on-artificial-intelligence/#article', 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://asiafoundation.org/2024/04/04/future-of-work-in-nepal-conference-on-artificial-intelligence/'}, 'author': {'name': 'olivia', '@id': 'https://asiafoundation.org/#/schema/person/cd04acb691b43b96ad0ba190ff14f023'}, 'headline': 'Future of Work in Nepal: Conference on Artificial Intelligence', 'datePublished': '2024-04-04T22:19:04+00:00', 'dateModified': '2024-04-04T22:19:04+00:00', 'mainEntityOfPage': {'@id': 'https://asiafoundation.org/2024/04/04/future-of-work-in-nepal-conference-on-artificial-intelligence/'}, 'wordCount': 302, 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://asiafoundation.org/#organization'}, 'image': {'@id': 'https://asiafoundation.org/2024/04/04/future-of-work-in-nepal-conference-on-artificial-intelligence/#primaryimage'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://asiafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AI-Conference-49-scaled.jpg', 'keywords': ['The Future of Work'], 'articleSection': ['Program Snapshot'], 'inLanguage': 'en-US'}, {'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://asiafoundation.org/2024/04/04/future-of-work-in-nepal-conference-on-artificial-intelligence/', 'url': 'https://asiafoundation.org/2024/04/04/future-of-work-in-nepal-conference-on-artificial-intelligence/', 'name': 'Future of Work in Nepal: Conference on Artificial Intelligence - The Asia Foundation', 'isPartOf': {'@id': 'https://asiafoundation.org/#website'}, 'primaryImageOfPage': {'@id': 'https://asiafoundation.org/2024/04/04/future-of-work-in-nepal-conference-on-artificial-intelligence/#primaryimage'}, 'image': {'@id': 'https://asiafoundation.org/2024/04/04/future-of-work-in-nepal-conference-on-artificial-intelligence/#primaryimage'}, 'thumbnailUrl': 'https://asiafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AI-Conference-49-scaled.jpg', 'datePublished': '2024-04-04T22:19:04+00:00', 'dateModified': '2024-04-04T22:19:04+00:00', 'breadcrumb': {'@id': 'https://asiafoundation.org/2024/04/04/future-of-work-in-nepal-conference-on-artificial-intelligence/#breadcrumb'}, 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'potentialAction': [{'@type': 'ReadAction', 'target': ['https://asiafoundation.org/2024/04/04/future-of-work-in-nepal-conference-on-artificial-intelligence/']}]}, {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', '@id': 'https://asiafoundation.org/2024/04/04/future-of-work-in-nepal-conference-on-artificial-intelligence/#primaryimage', 'url': 'https://asiafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AI-Conference-49-scaled.jpg', 'contentUrl': 'https://asiafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AI-Conference-49-scaled.jpg', 'width': 1100, 'height': 733, 'caption': 'A group of people stand in front of a presentation screen with trophies in hand.'}, {'@type': 'BreadcrumbList', '@id': 'https://asiafoundation.org/2024/04/04/future-of-work-in-nepal-conference-on-artificial-intelligence/#breadcrumb', 'itemListElement': [{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Home', 'item': 'https://asiafoundation.org/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Future of Work in Nepal: Conference on Artificial Intelligence'}]}, {'@type': 'WebSite', '@id': 'https://asiafoundation.org/#website', 'url': 'https://asiafoundation.org/', 'name': 'The Asia Foundation', 'description': 'Working for a peaceful, just, and thriving Asia.', 'publisher': {'@id': 'https://asiafoundation.org/#organization'}, 'potentialAction': [{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': {'@type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'https://asiafoundation.org/?s={search_term_string}'}, 'query-input': 'required name=search_term_string'}], 'inLanguage': 'en-US'}, {'@type': 'Organization', '@id': 'https://asiafoundation.org/#organization', 'name': 'The Asia Foundation', 'url': 'https://asiafoundation.org/', 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', '@id': 'https://asiafoundation.org/#/schema/logo/image/', 'url': 'https://asiafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/logo-234.png', 'contentUrl': 'https://asiafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/logo-234.png', 'width': 234, 'height': 32, 'caption': 'The Asia Foundation'}, 'image': {'@id': 'https://asiafoundation.org/#/schema/logo/image/'}, 'sameAs': ['https://www.facebook.com/TheAsiaFoundation/', 'https://x.com/Asia_Foundation', 'https://www.instagram.com/theasiafoundation/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-asia-foundation', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/AsiaFoundation']}, {'@type': 'Person', '@id': 'https://asiafoundation.org/#/schema/person/cd04acb691b43b96ad0ba190ff14f023', 'name': 'olivia'}]",N/A,N/A,N/A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It would appear that what was billed as an AI endeavour included thousands of Indians adding items to carts and charging the customers depending on what objects they walked out with.Just Walkt Out was billed a self-checkout system powered by cameras and censors, giving the illusion of an automated system.Amazon had claimed: “The feat is a combination of computer vision, object recognition, advanced sensors, deep machine learning models, and generative AI—a type of artificial intelligence that has recently captured the public’s imagination.”Jon Jenkins, vice president of Just Walk Out technology had said: “Our tech is able to distinguish shoppers from one another, without collecting or using any of their biometric information. Just Walk Out technology detects when a shopper’s hand interacts with a product on the shelf. When that happens, machine learning algorithms make sure the correct item is added to the virtual cart—all without any specific knowledge about the person.”The truth however is a little less exciting.A report in Gizmodo states: “Just over half of Amazon Fresh stores are equipped with Just Walk Out. The technology allows customers to skip checkout altogether by scanning a QR code when they enter the store. Though it seemed completely automated, Just Walk Out relied on more than 1,000 people in India watching and labeling videos to ensure accurate checkouts. The cashiers were simply moved off-site, and they watched you as you shopped.”Further reports state that it was a very expensive affair to maintain the equipment and included a host of issues like receipts being sent late to completely wrong orders. Basically, instead of having a cashier, a vast array of equipment was needed to do the same thing and offsite cashiers were needed to do the same thing.Reports further add that Amazon is now considering moving towards Dash Carts, a technology that has an inbuilt scanner and screen in the cart.An Amazon spokesperson told Gizmodo that they are rolling out Amazon Dash Cart to replace its Just Walk Out technology.Just Walk Out was first introduced in 2016. According to a report in The Information, 700 out of the 1000 Just Walk Out sales required human intervention. X users have a field dayX users were quite happy to learn about the human intervention that was required in Amazon’s Just Walk Out feature that bought into the old Silicon Valley myth that AI is actually powered by off-shore Indian workers.Another user wrote: “Amazon billed its ""Just Walk Out"" stores as some triumph of AI. In reality, it was powered by thousands of low-paid Indian workers manually adding up items in your cart as you shopped. How insanely dystopian.”Another pointed out: “It seems that in this case, ""A.I."" stands for ""Actually, we just relocated the cashier jobs to India"".”A third said: “We're gonna see more of this as AI spreads: technologies that promote efficiency by getting rid of superfluous jobs but actually just shuffle people out of view so companies can cut wages for the same position.”Amazon ReactsReacting to the report, an Amazon spokesperson said: “We’ve invested a lot of time redesigning a number of our Amazon Fresh stores over the last year, offering a better overall shopping experience with more value, convenience, and selection—and so far we’ve seen positive results, with higher customer shopping satisfaction scores and increased purchasing. We’ve also heard from customers that while they enjoyed the benefit of skipping the checkout line with Just Walk Out, they also wanted the ability to easily find nearby products and deals, view their receipt as they shop, and know how much money they saved while shopping throughout the store. To deliver even more convenience to our customers, we’re rolling out Amazon Dash Cart, our smart-shopping carts, which allows customers all these benefits including skipping the checkout line.”The spokesperson further added: ""The characterization that Just Walk Out technology relies on human reviewers is inaccurate. The primary role of our Machine Learning data associates is to annotate video images, which is necessary for continuously improving the underlying machine learning model powering Just Walk Out technology. Associates may also validate a small minority of shopping visits where our computer vision technology cannot determine with complete confidence an individual’s purchases. Just Walk Out technology has continued to scale while reducing the number of human reviews year-over-year.” ",,en,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'cssSelector': ['h1.hdg1', 'h2.sortDec']}",,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'CreativeWork', 'name': 'Hindustan Times', 'url': 'https://www.hindustantimes.com'}",,,,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/res/images/htlogo-v1.png', 'width': 600, 'height': 60}",,,,,,"['https://www.facebook.com/hindustantimes', 'https://twitter.com/htTweets', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/hindustantimes', 'https://www.instagram.com/hindustantimes/', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/ht']",,,,,"{'@type': 'PostalAddress', 'streetAddress': 'Hindustan Times House, 18-20, Kasturba Gandhi Marg', 'addressLocality': 'New Delhi', 'addressRegion': 'India', 'postalCode': '110 001'}","{'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+91 – 11 – 60004242', 'contactType': 'Customer Service', 'areaServed': 'IN', 'availableLanguage': 'English', 'hoursAvailable': {'opens': '09:00', 'closes': '18:00'}}","{'@type': 'imageObject', 'url': 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/04/03/1600x900/amazon_fresh_1712118753969_1712118763845.jpg', 'caption': 'An Amazon Fresh store ', 'description': 'An Amazon Fresh store ', 'height': '900', 'width': '1600'}",,,,,,,,

Fast FactsIndeed Tuesday launched Smart Sourcing, an AI-powered product suite. The intention is to quickly and efficiently connect employers with the most relevant candidates. The suite will offer 'instant recommendations' to employers based on active job listings. Like its predecessor, the internet, artificial intelligence has become the latest technology to take the world by storm. In these early stages of generative AI, companies have been pushing for greater application and more integration for months, in everything from internet searches to email writing. The latest integration the tech sector has dreamed up is a marriage between generative AI and the exhaustive trudge that is the job hunt. Digital-recruitment platform Indeed  (RCRUY)  on Tuesday announced Smart Sourcing, a suite of generative AI-powered tools designed to make job searching easier and more efficient for all parties involved. A whole new world: Cybersecurity expert calls out the breaking of online trustRead MoreA whole new world: Cybersecurity expert calls out the breaking of online trustRead MoreFor job seekers: Update to Indeed ProfileThe Smart Sourcing launch comes in hand with an update to Indeed Profile, which, according to the company, is meant to help job seekers better represent themselves to potential employers. A new update will enable users to make themselves visible to and available to outreach from employers. The AI offerings include an AI-powered writing tool to describe peoples' work experience on their Indeed Profiles. Indeed did not specify when this feature would become available but said it was coming soon.For employers: a number of new featuresThe bulk of the new features, however, are coming to employers. Smart Sourcing enables employers to receive instant recommendations for the most relevant candidates for any active job listings. It specifically surfaces people who are actively seeking jobs and have been active on Indeed within the past 30 days. These recommendations include AI-generated candidate summaries, which explain whether a candidate meets given qualifications and if they might be a good fit for a given role.An example of the employer-side of Indeed's Smart Sourcing tool. IndeedThe platform then enables employers to send AI-generated messages to their favorite candidates, meant to speed up the interviewing process. Indeed said that 92% of the employers already using the platform said it was their ""preferred product for finding active candidates."" Indeed did not disclose how many employers are already using Smart Sourcing. Indeed Chief Executive Chris Hyams said in a statement that hiring remains a ""challenging and inefficient"" process. He hopes that these new AI-powered tools will ""transform"" the job-search market, he said. The ethics of artificial intelligence: A path toward responsible AIRead MoreThe ethics of artificial intelligence: A path toward responsible AIRead MoreAlgorithmic discrimination: a major concernThis latest push to integrate AI-powered decision-making technology into yet more verticals comes amid ongoing and unanswered concern about algorithmic bias, discrimination and hallucination. Hallucinations, as AI researcher and cognitive scientist Gary Marcus has regularly pointed out, occur when the output of a generative AI application is confidently wrong. Hallucinations, according to Marcus, are an unavoidable hallmark of the large language model paradigm.At the same time, such models have become well-known for exhibiting bias and discrimination. Bloomberg conducted a study last year of text-to-image model Stability Diffusion, finding that ""the world according to Stable Diffusion is run by white male CEOs. Women are rarely doctors, lawyers or judges. Men with dark skin commit crimes, while women with dark skin flip burgers.""Numerous studies have pointed out a similar issue, with one finding that the output of three popular text-to-image generators ""consistently under-represent(ed) marginalized identities.""The issue is not just with image generators; several other recent studies have highlighted problems of bias inherent to the large-language-model architecture. The problem derives largely from unfair or biased training data, something that's difficult to address when the internet at large is the data source in question. ""It is clear that these powerful computational tools, if not diligently designed and audited, have the potential to perpetuate and even amplify existing biases, particularly those related to race, gender and other societal constructs,"" a 2023 paper states.A 2024 Unesco study found that such bias disproportionately affects women and girls, saying specifically that the bias has been perpetuated in the AI-assisted job-recruitment process. The study states that LLMs can ""reinforce stereotypes, biases and violence"" against women and girls through discriminatory AI-powered decision-making, such as an AI recruitment tool discounting a qualified female candidate.OpenAI board member has a scary prediction for the future of workRead MoreOpenAI board member has a scary prediction for the future of workRead MoreIndeed and ethical AI: a Responsible-AI teamAsked at a news conference Monday about such issues, Raj Mukherjee, an executive vice president at Indeed, said that AI has the power to ""transform society but also can be harnessed to harm people."" He cited Indeed's responsible-AI team, which he said works to make the product ""more fair and less biased."" He did not explain how Indeed achieves this. ""It's not that we are making it so obscure why someone has been a matched candidate for a particular role,"" Maggie Hulce, an executive vice president at Indeed, added. ""We're being really clear on what are the dimensions that seem to be well-aligned.""The executives did not specify how Indeed is ensuring that the Smart Sourcing tech is fair and unbiased. Indeed's head of responsible AI, Trey Causey, told TheStreet that no system can ever be completely unbiased.Causey did say that Indeed uses a ""combination of qualitative and quantitative data to evaluate those systems’ performance along a number of dimensions, including fairness. Users are provided with mechanisms to provide feedback about GenAI outputs and we use that feedback to continually improve our systems.""Contact Ian with tips and AI stories via email, ian.krietzberg@thearenagroup.net, or Signal 732-804-1223.By Ian KrietzbergIan Krietzberg is a tech reporter for The Street.

Every community college is dealing with the emergence of generative artificial intelligence; the positive implications for increased efficiencies, improved student services, more creative and relevant curriculum and the transformation of workforce readiness and training are profound.  
However, community colleges need to confront certain realities that could impede our success in implementation including:

The cost of the transformation of curriculum, services and workforce preparation will be substantial. We operate with significant fiscal limitations so need to be prudent and organized in our efforts to embrace Generative AI
Limited staffing. Again, we will need to work with the staffing we have and, where possible, develop more creative ways to implement AI strategies on campus.
Those we serve in the workplace likely don’t know what they need and we are equally ill-equipped to tell them.


This article is part of a monthly column provided by the Instructional Technology Council, an affiliated council of the American Association of Community Colleges.

A number of community colleges have been early standouts in their approach to generative AI, but for most community colleges, it is hard to even know where to start. The Instructional Technology Council (ITC) created an AI Affinity Group to bring together institutions and individuals that have been “early-adopters” and “early-adapters” of generative AI. The special panel has been methodical in its review of the essentials each community college needs to establish a productive approach to the exploration and implementation of generative AI.  
The result: ITC recommendations regarding the 10 things your campus should be doing to launch generative AI:
1.) Develop initial policies to establish a framework for exploration and application. Campus policies for generative AI will always be a work in progress, but initial policies to consider include: Ethics – identifying parameters and guardrails for the ethical use of generative AI; Privacy – to protect students and staff and academic integrity – to strike a balance that reaffirms the criticality of academic integrity while opening the door to exploration and utilization rather than slamming the door shut.
2.) Create a permanent campus committee to oversee AI and emergent technologies. The committee will necessarily comprise campus stakeholder groups rather than technology experts (since campuses don’t have many experts – yet). Broad campus representation is critical to ensure a cross-section of voices are heard. In addition, the scope of the committee should include emergent technologies (virtual reality, for instance) since additional challenges are coming with other technologies as well.
3.) Secure funding to support professional development, exploration and implementation. The oversight committee will help to develop needed professional development training at a scale and scope that is unprecedented. Secure and regular funding will ensure that the training program can meet the needs of all campus stakeholder groups. ITC also encourages institutions to be proactive in seeking grant funding to supplement the costs of an extensive professional development program over several years. An increasing number of grant opportunities are emerging in this field, especially related to workforce development. There are increased opportunities to collaborate with other institutions and/or workforce partners.
4.) Identify the key stakeholders at your institution (key groups). This may vary, but for most institutions, the likely stakeholder groups include:

Faculty (full- and part-time)
Students
IT support
Administrators
Student services
Leadership

Recognizing these key groups will help to understand how to effectively tailor and diversify professional development training. Generative AI training cannot be “one size fits all”; rather it needs to be engaging and relevant to fit the needs of each particular stakeholder group.
5.) Create a culture of open dialog in with those that fear the emergence of AI can feel safe in expressing their concerns. On each campus, there are colleagues in each stakeholder’s group that perceive generative AI as an existential threat. Institutions should listen and promote dialogue. An approach that “reaches back” to ensure everyone moves forward is a positive an empathic approach that will promote greater buy-in in the long-term.
6.) Scaffold professional development (PD) for each identified stakeholder group. The oversight committee, working with the campus PD coordinator, should be developing a full-year generative AI professional development plan that includes sessions for each stakeholder group.  In addition, the training should scaffold the training sessions to promote evolution and growth in understanding and application. 
7.) Recognize the need to invite external expertise (most campuses do not have experts – need PD that engages, impresses and builds confidence). As previously mentioned, several campuses are leaders at the community college level. Rather than re-inventing the wheel, you can jump-start your exploration of generative AI by inviting presenters from those leaders. This may also lead to collaborations as well.
8.) Focus PD training on “how to explore/utilize” rather than on “how AI works.” For most of our colleagues, there is not a real desire to understand how generative AI works – after, most of us don’t understand our phones or other devices. Rather, most want to understand how to use this new technology and want specific strategies for implementation. 
9.) Reach out to your community – determine what AI skills/abilities are needed in the local workforce – then build backwards to create the curriculum and training needed. Community colleges are different from universities. For community colleges, the best approach to generative AI is working backwards: learn what your local economy and workforce need/will need related to AI and other emergent technologies and then develop the degrees, certificates, skills certificates and soft skills to support your community. Admittedly, there is a risk that your community simply doesn’t know what it needs, but that creates an opportunity to work together to determine the needs as well as the college response to support those needs.
10.) Look for partners/collaborators both within higher education and in the greater community. You do not have to embark on this journey alone. The 21st century represents a paradigm shift in what we must learn, how to learn and how to adapt to a rapidly changing set of needs for the workforce. Partnerships with your community, with other higher education institutions, with local school districts and with organizations like the Instructional Technology Council can create a culture of connections and relevance. There are a variety of ways to foster this climate of collaboration; you can determine what works best for you.
The ITC AI Affinity Group will continue to assess generative AI and will share additional recommendations as warranted.
