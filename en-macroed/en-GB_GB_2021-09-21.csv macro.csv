According to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, its impact will be even greater than that of fire or electricity on our development as a species. This may seem like a very ambitious claim, but considering it is already being used to help us tackle climate change, explore space, and develop treatments for cancer, the potential is clearly there.
The 7 Biggest Artificial Intelligence (AI) Trends In 2022Adobe Stock

The full scale of the impact that giving machines the ability to make decisions – and therefore enable decision-making to take place far more quickly and accurately than could ever be done by humans – is very difficult to conceive right now. But one thing we can be certain of is that in 2022 breakthroughs and new developments will continue to push the boundaries of what’s possible. Here’s my pick of the key areas and fields where those breakthroughs will occur in 2022:

The augmented workforce 

There have always been fears that machines or robots will replace human workers and maybe even make some roles redundant. However, as companies navigate the process of creating data and AI-literate cultures within their teams, we will increasingly find ourselves working with or alongside machines that use smart and cognitive functionality to boost our own abilities and skills. In some functions, such as marketing, we’re already used to using tools that help us determine which leads are worth pursuing and what value we can expect from potential customers. In engineering roles, AI tools help us by providing predictive maintenance – letting us know ahead of time when machines will need servicing or repairing. In knowledge industries, such as law, we will increasingly use tools that help us sort through the ever-growing amount of data that's available to find the nuggets of information that we need for a particular task. In just about every occupation, smart tools and services are emerging that can help us do our jobs more efficiently, and in 2022 more of us will find that they are a part of our everyday working lives.

PROMOTED
Bigger and better language modeling
Language modeling is a process that allows machines to understand and communicate with us in language we understand – or even take natural human languages and turn them into computer code that can run programs and applications. We have recently seen the release of GPT-3 by OpenAI, the most advanced (and largest) language model ever created, consisting of around 175 billion “parameters”- variables and datapoints that machines can use to process language. OpenAI is known to be working on a successor, GPT-4, that will be even more powerful. Although details haven’t been confirmed, some estimate that it may contain up to 100 trillion parameters, making it 500 times larger than GPT-3, and in theory taking a big step closer to being able to create language and hold conversations that are indistinguishable from those of a human. It will also become much better at creating computer code.
AI in cybersecurity 
This year the World Economic Forum identified cybercrime as potentially posing a more significant risk to society than terrorism. As machines take over more of our lives, hacking and cybercrime inevitably become more of a problem, as every connected device you add to a network is inevitably a potential point-of-failure that an attacker could use against you. As networks of connected devices become more complex, identifying those points of failure becomes more complex. This is where AI can play a role, though. By analyzing network traffic and learning to recognize patterns that suggest nefarious intentions, smart algorithms are increasingly playing a role in keeping us safe from 21st-century crime. Some of the most significant applications of AI that we will see develop in 2022 are likely to be in this area.

AI and the Metaverse
The metaverse is the name given for a unified persistent digital environment, where users can work and play together. It’s a virtual world, like the internet, but with the emphasis on enabling immersive experiences, often created by the users themselves. The concept has become a hot topic since Mark Zuckerberg spoke about creating it by combing virtual reality technology with the social foundations of his Facebook platform.

AI will undoubtedly be a lynchpin of the metaverse. It will help to create online environments where humans will feel at home at having their creative impulses nurtured. We will also most likely become used to sharing our metaverse environments with AI beings that will help us with tasks we’re there to do, or just be our partner for a game of tennis or chess when we want to relax and unwind.

Low-code and no-code AI 
A big barrier to the adoption of AI-driven efficiency in many companies is the scarcity of skilled AI engineers who can create the necessary tools and algorithms. No-code and low-code solutions aim to overcome this by offering simple interfaces that can be used, in theory, to construct increasingly complex AI systems. Much like the way web design and no-code UI tools now let users create web pages and other interactive systems simply by dragging and dropping graphical elements together, no-code AI systems will let us create smart programs by plugging together different, pre-made modules and feeding them with our own domain-specific data. Technologies such as natural language processing and language modeling (see above) mean that soon it may be possible to use nothing more than our voice or written instructions. All of this will play a key role in the ongoing ""democratization” of AI and data technology.
Autonomous vehicles
AI is the ""brains"" that will guide the autonomous cars, boats, and aircraft that are set to revolutionize travel and society over the coming decade. 2022 should be a year to remember when we look back in the future and contemplate with horror the fact that we thought it was normal that 1.3 million people died of traffic accidents every year, 90% of which were caused by human error!
As well as increasingly effective autonomous cars – Tesla says its cars will demonstrate full self-driving capability by 2022, although it’s unlikely they will be ready for general use. Its competitors include Waymo (created by Google), Apple, GM, and Ford, and any of them can be expected to announce major leaps forward in the next year. The year will hopefully also see the first autonomous ship crossing the Atlantic, as the Mayflower Autonomous Ship (MAS), powered by IBM and designed in partnership with non-profit ProMare, will once again attempt the journey (having been forced to turn back during its initial attempt this year).
Creative AI
We know that AI can be used to create art, music, poetry, plays, and even video games. In 2022, as new models such as GPT-4 and Google’s Brain redefine the boundaries of what’s possible, we can expect more elaborate and seemingly “natural” creative output from our increasingly imaginative and capable electronic friends. Rather than these creations generally being demonstrations or experiments to show off the potential of AI, as is the case now, in 2022, we will increasingly see them applied to routine creative tasks, such as writing headlines for articles and newsletters, designing logos and infographics. Creativity is often seen as a very human skill, and the fact we are now seeing these capabilities emerging in machines means “artificial” intelligence is undeniably coming closer in terms of scope and function to the somewhat nebulous concept we have of what constitutes “real” intelligence.

  <li>
    <p>Aims to position country as global leader in the governance of AI technologies and includes plans for a white paper on AI regulation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>New National AI Research and Innovation Programme alongside review of nation’s future computing capacity will help make sure UK discovers and develops latest innovations</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The UK today launches its first <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-ai-strategy"" class=""govuk-link"">National Artificial Intelligence (AI) Strategy</a> to help it strengthen its position as a global science superpower and seize the potential of modern technology to improve people’s lives and solve global challenges such as climate change and public health.</p>

<p>AI technologies underpin the tech and apps we use on a daily basis - from helping us navigate around cities and stopping online banking fraud to enabling voice recognition in smart speakers. They help clinicians improve their diagnosis of disease, are unlocking the potential for driverless cars and will deliver thousands of unforeseen benefits in everyday life.</p>

<p>The UK’s first <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-ai-strategy"" class=""govuk-link"">AI strategy</a> - published on the third day of London Tech Week - marks a step change in the country’s approach to the fastest growing emerging technology in the world. There are plans to launch a new national programme and approach to support research and development, publish a white paper on the governance and regulation of AI to build confidence in its use, plus moves to support organisations in every region and sector capitalise on the power of AI technologies.</p>

<p>The UK has a long and exceptional history in AI – from codebreaker Alan Turing’s early work through to London-based powerhouse DeepMind’s pioneering research which will enable quicker and more advanced drug discovery. The country is ranked third in the world for private venture capital investment into AI companies (2019 investment into the UK reached almost £2.5 billion) and home to a third of Europe’s total AI companies.</p>

<p>Alongside measures to develop the next generation of AI talent through continued  support for postgraduate learning, retraining and making sure children from wide backgrounds can access specialist courses, the strategy will position the UK as a global leader in raising the standards around the use of the technology while building the case for deeper investor confidence. It includes plans to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Launch a National AI Research and Innovation Programme to improve coordination and collaboration between the country’s researchers and help transform the UK’s AI capabilities, while boosting business and public sector adoption of AI technologies and their ability to take them to market.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Support the government’s levelling up agenda by launching a joint Office for AI (OAI) and UK Research &amp; Innovation (UKRI) programme aimed at continuing to develop AI in sectors based outside of London and the South East. This would focus on the commercialisation of ideas and could see, for example, the government focusing investment, researchers and developers to work in areas which currently do not use much AI technology but have great potential, such as energy and farming.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Publish a joint review with UKRI into the availability and capacity of computing power for UK researchers and organisations, including the physical hardware needed to drive a major roll out in AI technologies. The review will also consider wider needs for the commercialisation and deployment of AI, including its environmental impacts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Launch a consultation on copyright and patents for AI through the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) to make sure the UK is capitalising on the ideas it generates and by best supporting AI development and use through the copyright and patent system.  This consultation will also include a focus on how to protect AI generated inventions which would otherwise not meet inventorship criteria as well as measures to make it easier to use copyright protected material in AI development.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Trialing an AI Standards Hub to coordinate UK engagement in setting the rules globally, and working with The Alan Turing Institute to update guidance on AI ethics and safety in the public sector and create practical tools to make sure the technology is used ethically.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>DCMS Minister Chris Philp said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Artificial intelligence technologies generate billions for the economy and improve our lives. They power the technology we use on a daily basis and help save lives through better disease diagnosis and drug discovery.</p>

  <p>The UK already punches above its weight internationally and we are ranked third in the world behind the USA and China in the list of top countries for AI.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">Today we’re laying the foundations for the next ten years’ growth with a strategy to help us seize the potential of artificial intelligence and play a leading role in shaping the way the world governs it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The strategy comes in the week new data shows global investors poured £13.5 billion into more than 1,400 UK private technology firms between January and June this year - more than that achieved in other large tech markets Germany, France and Israel combined.</p>

<p>It follows government investment of more than £2.3 billion into AI since 2014, and has a ten-year vision to transform the UK’s capabilities in AI in parallel with the rapid technological expansion around the world. Its aim is to position the UK as the best place to live and work with AI, with clear rules, applied ethical principles and a pro-innovation regulatory environment.</p>

<p>It focuses on three pillars which include making sure the country invests in the long term growth of AI; that it benefits all sectors and regions of the economy; and that it is governed effectively by adequate rules which encourage innovation, investment and protect the public and the country’s fundamental values.</p>

<p>This includes measures to support skills, including the country’s Turing Fellowships Programme, Centres for Doctoral Training and postgraduate industrial masters and conversion courses, alongside plans to support the National Centre for Computing Education to ensure programmes for children in AI are accessible and reach the widest demographic.</p>

<p>The government will also launch a Defence AI Strategy later this year, the new Defence AI Centre through the Ministry of Defence and begin engagement on the draft National Strategy for AI-driven technologies in Health and Social Care through the NHS AI Lab.</p>

<p>Government Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>AI technologies have the capacity to fundamentally transform many aspects of the way we live and work.</p>

  <p class=""last-child"">The UK is already a world leader in certain aspects of AI – and this strategy helps to define how to enhance those capabilities further to ensure that the UK can both develop and use AI for the benefit of citizens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Benevolent AI CEO and Co-Chair of Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) Joanna Shields said:</p>

<blockquote>

                Throughout the project, Beethoven’s genius loomed.
              Circe Denyer



When Ludwig von Beethoven died in 1827, he was three years removed from the completion of his Ninth Symphony, a work heralded by many as his magnum opus. He had started work on his Tenth Symphony but, due to deteriorating health, wasn’t able to make much headway: All he left behind were some musical sketches.
Ever since then, Beethoven fans and musicologists have puzzled and lamented over what could have been. His notes teased at some magnificent reward, albeit one that seemed forever out of reach.

Now, thanks to the work of a team of music historians, musicologists, composers and computer scientists, Beethoven’s vision will come to life.
I presided over the artificial intelligence side of the project, leading a group of scientists at the creative A.I. startup Playform AI that taught a machine both Beethoven’s entire body of work and his creative process.
A full recording of Beethoven’s Tenth Symphony is set to be released on October 9, 2021, the same day as the world premiere performance scheduled to take place in Bonn, Germany - the culmination of a two-year-plus effort.
Past attempts hit a wall
Around 1817, the Royal Philharmonic Society in London commissioned Beethoven to write his Ninth and Tenth symphonies. Written for an orchestra, symphonies often contain four movements: the first is performed at a fast tempo, the second at a slower one, the third at a medium or fast tempo, and the last at a fast tempo.
Beethoven completed his Ninth Symphony in 1824, which concludes with the timeless “Ode to Joy.”
But when it came to the Tenth Symphony, Beethoven didn’t leave much behind, other than some musical notes and a handful of ideas he had jotted down.

There have been some past attempts to reconstruct parts of Beethoven’s Tenth Symphony. Most famously, in 1988, musicologist Barry Cooper ventured to complete the first and second movements. He wove together 250 bars of music from the sketches to create what was, in his view, a production of the first movement that was faithful to Beethoven’s vision.
Yet the sparseness of Beethoven’s sketches made it impossible for symphony experts to go beyond that first movement.
Assembling the team
In early 2019, Dr. Matthias Röder, the director of the Karajan Institute, an organization in Salzburg, Austria, that promotes music technology, contacted me. He explained that he was putting together a team to complete Beethoven’s Tenth Symphony in celebration of the composer’s 250th birthday. Aware of my work on A.I.-generated art, he wanted to know if A.I. would be able to help fill in the blanks left by Beethoven.
The challenge seemed daunting. To pull it off, A.I. would need to do something it had never done before. But I said I would give it a shot.
Röder then compiled a team that included Austrian composer Walter Werzowa. Famous for writing Intel’s signature bong jingle, Werzowa was tasked with putting together a new kind of composition that would integrate what Beethoven left behind with what the A.I. would generate. Mark Gotham, a computational music expert, led the effort to transcribe Beethoven’s sketches and process his entire body of work so the A.I. could be properly trained.
The team also included Robert Levin, a musicologist at Harvard University who also happens to be an incredible pianist. Levin had previously finished a number of incomplete 18th-century works by Mozart and Johann Sebastian Bach.
The project takes shape
In June 2019, the group gathered for a two-day workshop at Harvard’s music library. In a large room with a piano, a blackboard and a stack of Beethoven’s sketchbooks spanning most of his known works, we talked about how fragments could be turned into a complete piece of music and how A.I. could help solve this puzzle, while still remaining faithful to Beethoven’s process and vision.
The music experts in the room were eager to learn more about the sort of music A.I. had created in the past. I told them how A.I. had successfully generated music in the style of Bach. However, this was only a harmonization of an inputted melody that sounded like Bach. It didn’t come close to what we needed to do: construct an entire symphony from a handful of phrases.

Meanwhile, the scientists in the room - myself included - wanted to learn about what sort of materials were available, and how the experts envisioned using them to complete the symphony.
The task at hand eventually crystallized. We would need to use notes and completed compositions from Beethoven’s entire body of work - along with the available sketches from the Tenth Symphony - to create something that Beethoven himself might have written.
This was a tremendous challenge. We didn’t have a machine that we could feed sketches to, push a button and have it spit out a symphony. Most A.I. available at the time couldn’t continue an uncompleted piece of music beyond a few additional seconds.
We would need to push the boundaries of what creative A.I. could do by teaching the machine Beethoven’s creative process - how he would take a few bars of music and painstakingly develop them into stirring symphonies, quartets and sonatas.
Piecing together Beethoven’s creative process
As the project progressed, the human side and the machine side of the collaboration evolved. Werzowa, Gotham, Levin, and Röder deciphered and transcribed the sketches from the Tenth Symphony, trying to understand Beethoven’s intentions. Using his completed symphonies as a template, they attempted to piece together the puzzle of where the fragments of sketches should go - which movement, which part of the movement.
They had to make decisions, like determining whether a sketch indicated the starting point of a scherzo, which is a very lively part of the symphony, typically in the third movement. Or they might determine that a line of music was likely the basis of a fugue, which is a melody created by interweaving parts that all echo a central theme.
The A.I. side of the project - my side - found itself grappling with a range of challenging tasks.
First, and most fundamentally, we needed to figure out how to take a short phrase, or even just a motif, and use it to develop a longer, more complicated musical structure, just as Beethoven would have done. For example, the machine had to learn how Beethoven constructed the Fifth Symphony out of a basic four-note motif.

Next, because the continuation of a phrase also needs to follow a certain musical form, whether it’s a scherzo, trio or fugue, the A.I. needed to learn Beethoven’s process for developing these forms.
The to-do list grew: We had to teach the A.I. how to take a melodic line and harmonize it. The A.I. needed to learn how to bridge two sections of music together. And we realized the A.I. had to be able to compose a coda, which is a segment that brings a section of a piece of music to its conclusion.
Finally, once we had a full composition, the A.I. was going to have to figure out how to orchestrate it, which involves assigning different instruments for different parts.
And it had to pull off these tasks in the way Beethoven might do so.
Passing the first big test
In November 2019, the team met in person again - this time, in Bonn, at the Beethoven House Museum, where the composer was born and raised.
This meeting was the litmus test for determining whether A.I. could complete this project. We printed musical scores that had been developed by A.I. and built off the sketches from Beethoven’s Tenth. A pianist performed in a small concert hall in the museum before a group of journalists, music scholars and Beethoven experts.

We challenged the audience to determine where Beethoven’s phrases ended and where the A.I. extrapolation began. They couldn’t.
A few days later, one of these A.I.-generated scores was played by a string quartet in a news conference. Only those who intimately knew Beethoven’s sketches for the Tenth Symphony could determine when the A.I.-generated parts came in.
The success of these tests told us we were on the right track. But these were just a couple of minutes of music. There was still much more work to do.
Ready for the world
At every point, Beethoven’s genius loomed, challenging us to do better. As the project evolved, the A.I. did as well. Over the ensuing 18 months, we constructed and orchestrated two entire movements of more than 20 minutes apiece.
We anticipate some pushback to this work - those who will say that the arts should be off-limits from A.I., and that A.I. has no business trying to replicate the human creative process. Yet when it comes to the arts, I see A.I. not as a replacement, but as a tool - one that opens doors for artists to express themselves in new ways.
This project would not have been possible without the expertise of human historians and musicians. It took an immense amount of work - and, yes, creative thinking - to accomplish this goal.
At one point, one of the music experts on the team said that the A.I. reminded him of an eager music student who practices every day, learns, and becomes better and better.
Now that student, having taken the baton from Beethoven, is ready to present the Tenth Symphony to the world.

        7 Revealing Ways AIs Fail

    LightBlueArtificial intelligence could perform more quickly, accurately, reliably, and impartially than humans on a wide range of problems, from detecting cancer to deciding who receives an interview for a job. But AIs have also suffered numerous, sometimes deadly, failures. And the increasing ubiquity of AI means that failures can affect not just individuals but millions of people.
	Increasingly, the AI community is 
	cataloging these failures with an eye toward monitoring the risks they may pose. ""There tends to be very little information for users to understand how these systems work and what it means to them,"" says Charlie Pownall, founder of the AI, Algorithmic and Automation Incident & Controversy Repository. ""I think this directly impacts trust and confidence in these systems. There are lots of possible reasons why organizations are reluctant to get into the nitty-gritty of what exactly happened in an AI incident or controversy, not the least being potential legal exposure, but if looked at through the lens of trustworthiness, it's in their best interest to do so.""
This article is part of our special report on AI, “The Great AI Reckoning.”
	Part of the problem is that the neural network technology that drives many AI systems can break down in ways that remain a mystery to researchers. ""It's unpredictable which problems artificial intelligence will be good at, because we don't understand intelligence itself very well,"" says computer scientist 
	Dan Hendrycks at the University of California, Berkeley.

	Here are seven examples of AI failures and what current weaknesses they reveal about artificial intelligence. Scientists discuss possible ways to deal with some of these problems; others currently defy explanation or may, philosophically speaking, lack any conclusive solution altogether.
1) BrittlenessChris Philpot
	Take a picture of a school bus. Flip it so it lays on its side, as it might be found in the case of an accident in the real world.
	 A 2018 study found that state-of-the-art AIs that would normally correctly identify the school bus right-side-up failed to do so on average 97 percent of the time when it was rotated.

	""They will say the school bus is a snowplow with very high confidence,"" says computer scientist 
	Anh Nguyen at Auburn University, in Alabama. The AIs are not capable of a task of mental rotation ""that even my 3-year-old son could do,"" he says.

	Such a failure is an example of brittleness. An AI often ""can only recognize a pattern it has seen before,"" Nguyen says. ""If you show it a new pattern, it is easily fooled.""

	There are numerous troubling cases of AI brittleness.
	 Fastening stickers on a stop sign can make an AI misread it. Changing a single pixel on an image can make an AI think a horse is a frog. Neural networks can be 99.99 percent confident that multicolor static is a picture of a lion. Medical images can get modified in a way imperceptible to the human eye so medical scans misdiagnose cancer 100 percent of the time. And so on.

	One possible way to make AIs more robust against such failures is to expose them to as many confounding ""adversarial"" examples as possible, Hendrycks says. However, they may still fail against rare ""
	black swan"" events. ""Black-swan problems such as COVID or the recession are hard for even humans to address—they may not be problems just specific to machine learning,"" he notes.
2) Embedded Bias Chris Philpot
	Increasingly, AI is used to help support major decisions, such as who receives a loan, the length of a jail sentence, and who gets health care first. The hope is that AIs can make decisions more impartially than people often have, but much research has found that biases embedded in the data on which these AIs are trained can result in automated discrimination en masse, posing immense risks to society.

	For example, in 2019, scientists found
	 a nationally deployed health care algorithm in the United States 
	was racially biased, affecting millions of Americans. The AI was designed to identify which patients would benefit most from intensive-care programs, but it routinely enrolled healthier white patients into such programs ahead of black patients who were sicker.

	Physician and researcher
	 Ziad Obermeyer at the University of California, Berkeley, and his colleagues found the algorithm mistakenly assumed that people with high health care costs were also the sickest patients and most in need of care. However, due to systemic racism, ""black patients are less likely to get health care when they need it, so are less likely to generate costs,"" he explains.

	After working with the software's developer, Obermeyer and his colleagues helped design a new algorithm that analyzed other variables and displayed 84 percent less bias. ""It's a lot more work, but accounting for bias is not at all impossible,"" he says. They recently
	 drafted a playbook that outlines a few basic steps that governments, businesses, and other groups can implement to detect and prevent bias in existing and future software they use. These include identifying all the algorithms they employ, understanding this software's ideal target and its performance toward that goal, retraining the AI if needed, and creating a high-level oversight body.
3) Catastrophic Forgetting Chris PhilpotDeepfakes—highly realistic artificially generated fake images and videos, often of celebrities, politicians, and other public figures—are becoming increasingly common on the Internet and social media, and could wreak plenty of havoc by fraudulently depicting people saying or doing things that never really happened. To develop an AI that could detect deepfakes, computer scientist Shahroz Tariq and his colleagues at Sungkyunkwan University, in South Korea, created a website where people could upload images to check their authenticity.

	In the beginning, the researchers trained their neural network to spot one kind of deepfake. However, after a few months, many new types of deepfake emerged, and when they trained their AI to identify these new varieties of deepfake, it quickly forgot how to detect the old ones.

	This was an example of catastrophic forgetting—the tendency of an AI to entirely and abruptly forget information it previously knew after learning new information, essentially overwriting past knowledge with new knowledge. ""Artificial neural networks have a terrible memory,"" Tariq says.

	AI researchers are pursuing a variety of strategies to prevent catastrophic forgetting so that neural networks can, as humans seem to do, continuously learn effortlessly. A simple technique is to create a specialized neural network for each new task one wants performed—say, distinguishing cats from dogs or apples from oranges—""but this is obviously not scalable, as the number of networks increases linearly with the number of tasks,"" says machine-learning researcher
	 Sam Kessler at the University of Oxford, in England.

	One alternative
	 Tariq and his colleagues explored as they trained their AI to spot new kinds of deepfakes was to supply it with a small amount of data on how it identified older types so it would not forget how to detect them. Essentially, this is like reviewing a summary of a textbook chapter before an exam, Tariq says.

	However, AIs may not always have access to past knowledge—for instance, when dealing with private information such as medical records. Tariq and his colleagues were trying to prevent an AI from relying on data from prior tasks. They had it train itself how to spot new deepfake types
	 while also learning from another AI that was previously trained how to recognize older deepfake varieties. They found this ""knowledge distillation"" strategy was roughly 87 percent accurate at detecting the kind of low-quality deepfakes typically shared on social media.
4) Explainability Chris Philpot
	Why 
	does an AI suspect a person might be a criminal or have cancer? The explanation for this and other high-stakes predictions can have many legal, medical, and other consequences. The way in which AIs reach conclusions has long been considered a mysterious black box, leading to many attempts to devise ways to explain AIs' inner workings. ""However, my recent work suggests the field of explainability is getting somewhat stuck,"" says Auburn's Nguyen.

	Nguyen and his colleagues
	 investigated seven different techniques that researchers have developed to attribute explanations for AI decisions—for instance, what makes an image of a matchstick a matchstick? Is it the flame or the wooden stick? They discovered that many of these methods ""are quite unstable,"" Nguyen says. ""They can give you different explanations every time.""

	In addition, while one attribution method might work on one set of neural networks, ""it might fail completely on another set,"" Nguyen adds. The future of explainability may involve building databases of correct explanations, Nguyen says. Attribution methods can then go to such knowledge bases ""and search for facts that might explain decisions,"" he says.
5) Quantifying Uncertainty Chris Philpot
	In 2016, a Tesla Model S car on autopilot collided with a truck that was turning left in front of it in northern Florida, killing its driver—
	the automated driving system's 
	first reported fatality. According to Tesla's official blog, neither the autopilot system nor the driver ""noticed the white side of the tractor trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied.""

	One potential way Tesla, Uber, and other companies may avoid such disasters is for their cars to do a better job at calculating and dealing with uncertainty. Currently AIs ""can be very certain even though they're very wrong,"" Oxford's Kessler says that if an algorithm makes a decision, ""we should have a robust idea of how confident it is in that decision, especially for a medical diagnosis or a self-driving car, and if it's very uncertain, then a human can intervene and give [their] own verdict or assessment of the situation.""

	For example, computer scientist
	 Moloud Abdar at Deakin University in Australia and his colleagues applied several different uncertainty quantification techniques as an AI classified skin-cancer images as malignant or benign, or melanoma or not. The researcher found these methods helped prevent the AI from making overconfident diagnoses.

	Autonomous vehicles remain challenging for uncertainty quantification, as current uncertainty-quantification techniques are often relatively time consuming, ""and cars cannot wait for them,"" Abdar says. ""We need to have much faster approaches.""
6) Common Sense Chris Philpot
	AIs lack common sense—the ability to reach acceptable, logical conclusions based on a vast context of everyday knowledge that people usually take for granted, says computer scientist
	 Xiang Ren at the University of Southern California. ""If you don't pay very much attention to what these models are actually learning, they can learn shortcuts that lead them to misbehave,"" he says.

	For instance, scientists may train AIs to detect hate speech on data where such speech is unusually high, such as white supremacist forums. However,
	 when this software is 
	exposed to the real world, it can fail to recognize that black and gay people may respectively use the words ""black"" and ""gay"" more often than other groups. ""Even if a post is quoting a news article mentioning Jewish or black or gay people without any particular sentiment, it might be misclassified as hate speech,"" Ren says. In contrast, ""humans reading through a whole sentence can recognize when an adjective is used in a hateful context.""

	Previous research suggested that state-of-the-art AIs could draw logical inferences about the world with up to roughly 90 percent accuracy, suggesting they were making progress at achieving common sense. However,
	 when Ren and his colleagues 
	tested these models, they found even the best AI could generate logically coherent sentences with slightly less than 32 percent accuracy. When it comes to developing common sense, ""one thing we care a lot [about] these days in the AI community is employing more comprehensive checklists to look at the behavior of models on multiple dimensions,"" he says.
7) Math 
            Chris Philpot
        
	Although conventional computers are good at crunching numbers, AIs ""are surprisingly not good at mathematics at all,"" Berkeley's Hendrycks says. ""You might have the latest and greatest models that take hundreds of GPUs to train, and they're still just not as reliable as a pocket calculator.""

	For example, Hendrycks and his colleagues trained an AI on hundreds of thousands of math problems with step-by-step solutions. However,
	 when 
	tested on 12,500 problems from high school math competitions, ""it only got something like 5 percent accuracy,"" he says. In comparison, a three-time International Mathematical Olympiad gold medalist attained 90 percent success on such problems ""without a calculator,"" he adds.

	Neural networks nowadays can learn to solve nearly every kind of problem ""if you just give it enough data and enough resources, but not math,"" Hendrycks says. Many problems in science require a lot of math, so this current weakness of AI can limit its application in scientific research, he notes.

	It remains uncertain why AI is currently bad at math. One possibility is that neural networks attack problems in a highly parallel manner like human brains, whereas math problems typically require a long series of steps to solve, so maybe the way AIs process data is not as suitable for such tasks, ""in the same way that humans generally can't do huge calculations in their head,"" Hendrycks says. However, AI's poor performance on math ""is still a niche topic: There hasn't been much traction on the problem,"" he adds.

Benefits can add to service, maintenance and more.

   The loss of expert know-how, already a problem for years, has been made worse due to the coronavirus pandemic. A network of expertise, optimized by artificial intelligence, may be the way to get ahead of the problem.
 Companies for years have been dealing with an aging workforce—losing talent and knowledge to retirement. The pandemic has accelerated this, particularly in water treatment. How do treatment plants replace the 20-year service or maintenance veterans and their expertise? Right now, the best technicians are supporting users and newer techs. Imagine that one of them calls their boss tomorrow and says they are suddenly retiring. How can companies make up for their knowledge once they walk out the door?
 The baby boomer generation of workers did not change jobs too often. One study says the average job tenure for baby boomers is eight years. That is a lot of time to build up expertise. On the other hand, the same study says millennials’ average job tenure is just under two and a half years. So, the boomers are retiring, and it is likely their replacements will not stay around as long. How should companies plan for this?
 








The pandemic changed many users’ habits, and now end users are wanting to do more problem resolution themselves without having to rely on support and a potential site visit from an engineer. For field service organizations, sending a service tech on-site has always been the last resort. How can water treatment plant operators be upskilled so they can resolve more issues themselves?
 The pandemic has seen a rise in solutions such as augmented reality/mixed reality (AR/MR) and other remote service tools. For these solutions to work, there still needs to be an expert on one end or the other. Also, AR/MR, knowledge bases, chatbots—none of these solutions improve skill levels. 
 These tools can be compared to having someone driving to an unfamiliar destination in a car. How much does the passenger remember afterward how to get to that destination? Research shows that humans forget 50% of what they learn within an hour. So, current remote service solutions may not be the answer. It could be possible to upskill technicians and users and enable them to retain and grow their new skill sets.
 An on-demand network of expertise that workers can access on-site to help resolve issues with all of the major machines and components at the plant may be the answer. The network would be capable of being automatically enriched and optimized based on the success and experience of its users.
 In water treatment, end users face the following challenges:

Experts are stretched thin and spend too much of their time helping lesser-skilled workers with simpler issues.
Plant managers often lack the skills to troubleshoot an issue without outside support.
Many workers cannot interpret alarms or identify the root cause of a problem on their own.
When there is an issue, it is often a third-party component that is the source of the problem, which means long wait times for a service engineer to come to repair it. Or the local operator is left using Google to find a troubleshooting manual so they can fix it themselves.

 








The benefits of artificial intelligence are valuable, innovative and can apply to service, maintenance, installations, calibrations, training and more. AI can:

Enable plant operators to resolve more issues, improving plant productivity.
Upskill technicians so they can perform tasks above their paygrade and not always rely on the experts.
Capture unwritten knowledge gained over decades of experience. 
Shorten onboarding time for new hires, enabling them to perform most tasks in weeks instead of months or longer.
Reduce the burden on experts so that they can spend more of their time on the less common, more complex issues.
Company experts’ “know-how” may be the most important IP. Keep IP for the long term.
Improve organizational learning so that the team can do its job better.

Electronic health records have been widely adopted with the hope they would save time and improve the quality of patient care. But due to fragmented interfaces and tedious data entry procedures, physicians often spend more time navigating these systems than they do interacting with patients.

Researchers at MIT and the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center are combining machine learning and human-computer interaction to create a better electronic health record (EHR). They developed MedKnowts, a system that unifies the processes of looking up medical records and documenting patient information into a single, interactive interface.

Driven by artificial intelligence, this “smart” EHR automatically displays customized, patient-specific medical records when a clinician needs them. MedKnowts also provides autocomplete for clinical terms and auto-populates fields with patient information to help doctors work more efficiently.

“In the origins of EHRs, there was this tremendous enthusiasm that getting all this information organized would be helpful to be able to track billing records, report statistics to the government, and provide data for scientific research. But few stopped to ask the deep questions around whether they would be of use for the clinician. I think a lot of clinicians feel they have had this burden of EHRs put on them for the benefit of bureaucracies and scientists and accountants. We came into this project asking how EHRs might actually benefit clinicians,” says David Karger, professor of computer science in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and senior author of the paper.

The research was co-authored by CSAIL graduate students Luke Murray, who is the lead author, Divya Gopinath, and Monica Agrawal. Other authors include Steven Horng, an emergency medicine attending physician and clinical lead for machine learning at the Center for Healthcare Delivery Science of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and David Sontag, associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT and a member of CSAIL and the Institute for Medical Engineering and Science, and a principal investigator at the Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health. It will be presented at the Association for Computing Machinery Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology next month.

A problem-oriented tool

To design an EHR that would benefit doctors, the researchers had to think like doctors.

They created a note-taking editor with a side panel that displays relevant information from the patient’s medical history. That historical information appears in the form of cards that are focused on particular problems or concepts.

For instance, if MedKnowts identifies the clinical term “diabetes” in the text as a clinician types, the system automatically displays a “diabetes card” containing medications, lab values, and snippets from past records that are relevant to diabetes treatment.

Most EHRs store historical information on separate pages and list medications or lab values alphabetically or chronologically, forcing the clinician to search through data to find the information they need, Murray says. MedKnowts only displays information relevant to the particular concept the clinician is writing about.

“This is a closer match to the way doctors think about information. A lot of times, doctors will do this subconsciously. They will look through a medications page and only focus on the medications that are relevant to the current conditions. We are helping to do that process automatically and hopefully move some things out of the doctor’s head so they have more time to think about the complex part, which is determining what is wrong with the patient and coming up with a treatment plan,” Murray says.

Pieces of interactive text called chips serve as links to related cards. As a physician types a note, the autocomplete system recognizes clinical terms, such as medications, lab values, or conditions, and transforms them into chips. Each chip is displayed as a word or phrase that has been highlighted in a certain color depending on its category (red for a medical condition, green for a medication, yellow for a procedure, etc.)

Through the use of autocomplete, structured data on the patient’s conditions, symptoms, and medication usage is collected with no additional effort from the physician.

Sontag says he hopes the advance will “change the paradigm of how to create large-scale health datasets for studying disease progression and assessing the real-world effectiveness of treatments.”

In practice

After a year-long iterative design process, the researchers tested MedKnowts by deploying the software in the emergency department at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. They worked with an emergency physician and four hospital scribes who enter notes into the electronic health record.

Deploying the software in an emergency department, where doctors operate in a high-stress environment, involved a delicate balancing act, Agrawal says.

“One of the biggest challenges we faced was trying to get people to shift what they currently do. Doctors who have used the same system, and done the same dance of clicks so many times, form a sort of muscle memory. Whenever you are going to make a change, there is a question of is this worth it? And we definitely found that some features had greater usage than others,” she says.

The Covid-19 pandemic complicated the deployment, too. The researchers had been visiting the emergency department to get a sense of the workflow, but were forced to end those visits due to Covid-19 and were unable to be in the hospital while the system was being deployed.

Despite those initial challenges, MedKnowts became popular with the scribes over the course of the one-month deployment. They gave the system an average rating of 83.75 (out of 100) for usability.

Scribes found the autocomplete function especially useful for speeding up their work, according to survey results. Also, the color-coded chips helped them quickly scan notes for relevant information.

Those initial results are promising, but as the researchers consider the feedback and work on future iterations of MedKnowts, they plan to proceed with caution.

“What we are trying to do here is smooth the pathway for doctors and let them accelerate. There is some risk there. Part of the purpose of bureaucracy is to slow things down and make sure all the i’s are dotted and all the t’s are crossed. And if we have a computer dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s for doctors, that may actually be countering the goals of the bureaucracy, which is to force doctors to think twice before they make a decision. We have to be thinking about how to protect doctors and patients from the consequences of making the doctors more efficient,” Karger says.

A longer-term vision

The researchers plan to improve the machine learning algorithms that drive MedKnowts so the system can more effectively highlight parts of the medical record that are most relevant, Agrawal says.

They also want to consider the needs of different medical users. The researchers designed MedKnowts with an emergency department in mind — a setting where doctors are typically seeing patients for the first time. A primary care physician who knows their patients much better would likely have some different needs.

In the longer-term, the researchers envision creating an adaptive system that clinicians can contribute to. For example, perhaps a doctor realizes a certain cardiology term is missing from MedKnowts and adds that information to a card, which would update the system for all users.

The team is exploring commercialization as an avenue for further deployment.

“We want to build tools that let doctors create their own tools. We don’t expect doctors to learn to be programmers, but with the right support they might be able to radically customize whatever medical applications they are using to really suit their own needs and preferences,” Karger says.

This research was funded by the MIT Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health.

NSF Grant Supports Future Designers of ‘Trustworthy’ Artificial Intelligence

SEAS received $3 million through the National Science Foundation Research Traineeship Program to transform the future of work, develop a new model for graduate education and to fund cross-cutting student scholarship.

By Kristen Mitchell
The George Washington University School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS) received a $3 million award from the National Science Foundation to develop a transformative model for graduate education training that combines research in computer science and systems engineering to support the next generation of leaders and researchers in artificial intelligence (AI).
This new initiative marks the first time the university has been the primary institution on an award from the prestigious NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program. It brings together faculty from the SEAS Department of Engineering Management and Systems Engineering (EMSE) and the Department of Computer Science (CS), who will support 25 Ph.D. students over the next five years, develop a new graduate certificate program for mid-career professionals working with AI and host boot camps and seminars open to the GW community.
Over the past decade, AI tools have been developed at an unusually rapid pace. They’ve been deployed into environments where value maximization precedes regulation, the grant abstract states, and these tools impact every realm of life. Through this funding, GW will conduct research and educate interdisciplinary scholars capable of co-designing AI algorithms and work systems to unlock new opportunities in both the capabilities of new systems and their “trustworthiness.”
The designers of tomorrow must be able to take advantage of the power of AI while mitigating potential risks of embedding bias or cybersecurity threats, said Zoe Szajnfarber, principal investigator, professor and chair of EMSE. To do this, algorithm designers need to learn more about the complex systems in which AI will be deployed. AI adopters, including policymakers, also need to better understand the capabilities and limitations of these new technologies. 
“We made the case that a new approach is needed to train a next generation of researchers who are able to think about both algorithm design and the system in which it will be deployed, well enough to bridge across those disciplines so that we can take full advantage of the opportunities to transform work for social good, while mitigating unintended consequences,” she said.
This funded project, titled “Co-Design of Trustworthy AI and Future Work Systems,” is led by Dr. Szajnfarber and co-principal investigators Robert Pless, computer science department chair and the Patrick and Donna Martin Professor of Computer Science, Rachelle Heller, director of the SEAS Center for Women in Engineering and professor emerita of computer science, and Ekundayo Shittu, EMSE associate professor. The project will engage many other faculty members through interdisciplinary research projects focused on application areas of existing strength, including humanitarian operations, the information landscape and smart mobility. 
The NRT will build on existing Ph.D. programs, involving students who have a deep research area in either computer science or systems engineering. The goal is to bring these two fields together for meaningful, interdisciplinary interaction, Dr. Pless said.
“This project is a really good combination of a couple really deep technical disciplines of system engineering and computer science and AI,” Dr. Pless said. “It builds on some of the things that our strategic planning and our strategic research initiatives have been building towards for years.”
John Lach, dean of SEAS, said the NRT award to SEAS is a result of faculty leaders working across disciplines to create a compelling and distinctive vision for the future of graduate education.
“It’s in line with our school’s ‘engineering and...’ approach, which emphasizes the societal context in which engineering and computing are practiced,” Dr. Lach said. “This context—in addition to the program's technical depth and professional development—will prepare students to become leaders and cultivators of trust in our increasingly AI-driven world.""
Compared to traditional engineering or computer science Ph.D. programs, students will engage in coursework with an emphasis on building holistic skills including communication, leadership, teamwork and ethics. The faculty is also focused on providing opportunities for students from diverse backgrounds. Bringing more diverse perspectives into AI decision-making can help mitigate bias within well-intended systems to ensure they are trustworthy, equitable and fair.
“The reality is a lot of the seeds of unintended consequences get baked in through early design decisions,” Dr. Szajnfarber said. “They're really hard to correct later, but if you can think through the implications upfront—a big if—design changes are much easier in the initial stages. To that end, including more diverse perspectives early in design is known to help with this identification process.”
The new graduate certificate program—yet to be named—is expected to launch ahead of the fall 2022 semester. That program will be aimed toward working professionals who are asked to evaluate or integrate new technologies into organizations and critical decision functions to help them gain a stronger fundamental understanding of algorithm design to be more informed consumers and purchasers.
Certificate students and Ph.D. students will interact closely through seminars that aim to explore new cross-cutting ideas through discussions and case studies with external industry experts and faculty. This provides an important path for doctoral students to learn of the most pressing problems in practice, and mid-career professionals to gain access to the latest tools and insights, a type of cross pollination particularly enabled by GW’s Washington, D.C location. The seminar series, focused on trustworthiness in AI, is set to launch by next September.
This NRT award joins a list of prestigious research training awards the university has received recently. Over the past year, the School of Medicine and Health Sciences has been awarded three T32 Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award institutional research training grants from the Health Resources and Services Administration. The first to study cancer, the second to study HIV and the third in primary care research team development.

""I think in five years' time ... we'll see 45 to 60 second videos with every job application,"" says Erin Devlin.(Supplied)Based on employer feedback, though, Ms Devlin is expecting something of a revolution in the application process — towards the use of video — within years.""Video resumes are definitely going to be on the rise,"" she says. ""But I think what will be more relevant and useful for employers would be what would be a type of video cover letter... because it's a quick snapshot of who you are and what your key selling points are.""It's getting that elevator pitch right."" And while video job applications won't replace written resumes completely, they will become much more common, Ms Devlin says.""I think in five years' time ... we'll see 45 to 60 second videos with every job application coming through ... I think it'll be incredibly common by then.""Potential for discriminationThere's an obvious potential problem with video job applications: discrimination.On paper, you can reveal a lot about yourself — but you do not need to disclose your age, gender, socio-economic background or ethnicity.The written CV is an objective snapshot of your suitability for the role.Any follow-up interview is designed to test your ability to cope under pressure and answer questions that may be crucial to performing the role. Video resumes are essentially what those in marketing circles describe as an ""elevator pitch"".(Flickr: amtec.us.com)For Patrick Turner, an employment and industrial senior associate with Maurice Blackburn Lawyers, the emergence of video cover letters is ""disappointing"" — and potentially risky.""The risk is we lose a whole bunch of human potential that are screened out arbitrarily on the basis of some factors in a computer that doesn't interact with the person directly,"" Mr Turner says.He's referring to artificial intelligence that recruiters say employers will use to more efficiently sort through thousands of applications at a time.Adriane used to work up to 50 hours a week, now she works five. Thousands more are in her positionAustralia's unemployment rate drops again, but a steep fall in hours worked last month paints a more accurate picture of the economic pain resulting from COVID lockdowns.Read more""State and federal laws prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, sex, sexuality, age, and there are others,"" Mr Turner says.""Discrimination can be direct, and it can be more insidious and indirect — it can be where someone imposes an unreasonable condition, requirement or practice that disadvantages a person with a particular attribute.""An obvious example, he says, would be a program that screens applicants born after 1960, while a ""more subtle"" case might be a program that screens out candidates who have a break in their employment history.To avoid being open to legal challenge, Mr Turner says, employers ""need to make sure they're treating prospective employees fairly, and give everyone an opportunity to succeed"".Feedback is crucialAnd let's be honest: Your ego is likely to be a little more bruised if your video application is rejected, simply because you're revealing more of ""yourself"" in the process.Have you been treated unfairly at work?The ABC is investigating Australian work life and we need your help. Whether you're a worker, manager or employer, we want to hear from you.Read more""It does make you feel really good,"" marketing professional Ramona Hart says of her successful video job application.She also makes the point that you can't hide anything in a video application: ""You can fluff up things on your CV, but when you're on camera and you're speaking about yourself, I just think it's a lot more personable.""If there is a big shift toward video cover letters or resumes, it will no doubt solve many recruitment problems — and likely add a whole stack of new ones, too.Posted 21 Sep 202121 Sep 2021Tue 21 Sep 2021 at 3:00pm, updated 21 Sep 202121 Sep 2021Tue 21 Sep 2021 at 5:28pmShareCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Related StoriesUnemployment drops to a 13-year low, but there's only bad news behind the headline figureSydney set for 300,000 job losses as extended lockdown bites, pain spreading to other statesWhat makes a killer resumé in 2021More on:AustraliaBusiness, Economics and FinanceCareersComputer ScienceLawsWorkTop Stories'It looks like greenwashing': AustralianSuper's ethical option investing in coal, oil and gas industriesNeo-Nazi's social media suspension is only a drop in the ocean against extremism, warn expertsFederal Labor under pressure to cut ties with scandal-engulfed CFMEUAnalysis by David SpeersAfter once calling Donald Trump 'nuts', Kevin Rudd has changed his tunelivePressure mounts on Biden as high-profile Democrat joins calls for president to drop out of race'I haven't lost hope': Memorial service held near Amsterdam to mark 10-year anniversary of MH17 disasterAnalysis by Nick CamptonHow a blood-soaked try and unbreakable belief carried New South Wales to State of Origin gloryHere is the full list of Emmy nominees, with Shōgun, The Bear and Baby Reindeer on top and one more shout for The CrownIs there a clean finish for a wind turbine at the end of its life?

 After its much-awaited revelation nearly a year ago, the GMC Hummer EV is expected to go into production late this year. The rollout would be earlier than planned, and people can’t wait to find out how the newest General Motors EV would go against expectations. It turns out that the new Hummer EV will be powered by GM’s newest electric motors, with smooth operations aided by artificial intelligence.

 GMC Hummer To Debut New Ultium Technology 
 Via GM   





 Considered the first of GM’s next-gen EVs, the new Hummer EV is first vehicle in production that is underpinned by GM’s all-new Ultium battery architecture. Because of this, the new electric truck will debut a number of EV technologies, such as Ultium batteries and Ultium Drive units. 

 The Ultium Drive is GM’s collective term for a family of five interchangeable drive units and three motors. The new Hummer EV will be the first to employ the three-motor Ultium Drive system. The Drive System in the Hummer EV will employ the highest-rated motor that GM developed specially for its Ultium-based EVs. 



 Three Motors Designed For GM’s Ultium Drive System 
 Via GM   

 GM has created three Ultium Drive motors: a 180-kW front-drive motor, a 255-kW rear- and front-drive motor, and a 62-kW all-wheel drive assist motor. Since these motors were built as a scalable family, they share design principles and employ similar tooling and production strategies. 





 RELATED: GMC Flexes Its EV Hummer Hitting Pickup 60 MPH In Just 3 Seconds 

 The motor in the Hummer EV is the 255-kW unit, which, along with the 180- kW unit, is a permanent magnet motor. On the other hand, the 62-kW unit is an induction motor. Up to three electric motors can be fitted in one Ultium EV, with the Hummer EV served by three separate 255-kW motors for 1,000 hp of total system output. 



 Artificial Intelligence Enables Motors To Work Together 
 Via GM   

 To ensure that these electric motors are working as intended, GM engineers developed the needed software for their controllers. After all, three separate motors have to work together effectively as one system. To enable this, artificial intelligence and machine learning are employed, thereby ensuring that torque is distributed to the system in the most efficient manner. 





 The software of key power electronics components – including the power inverter module and inverter – is designed in-house. This software is responsible for the ability of the Hummer EV to sprint from zero to 60 mph in around 3 seconds. 

 On existing GM EVs, the inverter and other power electronics are located outside the drive units. But for the Hummer EV and other Ultium EVs, these components will be integrated directly into the drive units, which would help cut cost while reducing manufacturing complexity.

Companies around the globe have been talking about digital transformation for years, but with the entrance of the COVID-19 pandemic and new workplace challenges, most enterprises have necessarily sped up their tech modernization efforts. Hybrid cloud, multicloud, and cloud computing companies and services have recognized this digital transformation push and are providing a wider range of cloud services accordingly.
Advancing a strategy in cloud computing — or making computing capabilities available over the internet and distributed virtual data centers rather than on-premises data centers — is one of the top priorities for most organizations today. The data reflects this: according to a study from Fortune Business Insights, the global cloud computing market hit $250 billion in 2021 and is expected to reach $791.5 billion by 2028. 
Some of this growth comes from new challenges found in a distributed global workforce, but exciting changes in machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and big data growth have also precipitated the cloud’s expansion. Learn more about how the top cloud computing companies are providing the solutions that meet ever-changing business operation needs at scale.

Who Needs Cloud Solutions?

What Do Cloud Computing Companies Do?
Cloud computing companies offer a variety of enterprise cloud solutions, focused on infrastructure, platform, and/or software-based solutions. Although most smaller cloud companies specialize in one core area of cloud support, the biggest solutions providers tend to specialize in all three key areas of cloud computing services:
SaaS (Software-as-a-Service)
SaaS is a type of solution in which a third-party vendor delivers cloud applications over the internet. They are typically hosted on a remote server and do not require enterprise customers to manage the hardware or software updates involved.
Examples: Google Workspace, Zoom, Dropbox, Slack, HubSpot, Salesforce, ZenDesk
PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service)
In PaaS, the cloud vendor provides enterprises with a cloud platform for application creation and development. With the platform approach, developers can focus on applications while other users or a third party separately manage servers, storage, and other networking features. 
Examples: SAP Cloud, AWS Lambda, IBM Cloud Foundry, Red Hat OpenShift, Zoho Creator, Apache Stratos, Magento Commerce
IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service)
IaaS is cloud-based infrastructural support delivered via virtualization technologies. With IaaS, enterprise customers receive self-service compute resources, such as servers, operating systems, and storage — all of which they can scale up or down as needed. Many IaaS solutions offer PaaS and SaaS solutions within their portfolios.
Examples: AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Oracle Cloud, IBM Cloud, Alibaba Cloud, Open Cloud by RackSpace
Top Cloud Companies on the Market (Best by Category)
AWS
Best for Public Cloud, Largest Portfolio of Cloud Solutions

AWS is the largest and most widely recognized cloud vendor on the market, providing an IaaS solution with several PaaS and SaaS solutions also in its arsenal. Amazon’s cloud specialties run the gamut of cloud expectations, ranging from storage and container management to compute and virtualization to the migration services and management of new technologies powered by AI, ML, and IoT.
AWS is perhaps not the strongest solution for enterprises that want a slower migration or prefer to keep some of their legacy systems on-premises; many enterprises opt for competitors like Microsoft Azure, which are already familiar with traditional on-premises technology management. 
However, AWS is making great strides in the area of migration support, offering VMware Cloud on AWS as a virtualization solution for companies needing a more concrete bridge between their traditional data centers and their new cloud infrastructure.
Cloud Category: IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS
Key Features:

EC2 virtual cloud servers
Simple Storage Service (S3) for scalable cloud storage
RDS, Aurora, and DynamoDB for managed (relational) databases
SageMaker for building and deploying ML models
Outposts for running AWS infrastructure on-premises

Microsoft Azure
Best for Hybrid Cloud and Enterprise Interoperability

Microsoft Azure is the second largest public cloud provider and is growing at a quick enough rate that it could eventually surpass AWS. Much of Azure’s success is owed to Microsoft’s longstanding relationships with enterprises and its experience with providing widely used operating systems, applications, and collaborative tools to businesses. 
Microsoft’s knowledge of traditional business tools has made Azure a particularly strong resource for organizations that either want to maintain their on-premises infrastructure or plan for a slow transition to the cloud. With hybrid cloud solutions such as Azure Arc, Azure Stack, and Azure Active Directory, customers are provided with several different tools to connect their on-premises infrastructure to the cloud. 
Azure also shines in the area of SaaS, turning many of its more traditional product offerings into cloud-friendly applications, such as its CRM and ERP solution, Microsoft Dynamics 365.

IBM Cloud
Best for Multicloud Development

Although IBM Cloud is a much smaller solution than the previous “Big Three,” its portfolio covers the same basics as most other IaaS vendors and especially stands out in the area of multicloud development. Its primary multicloud tool, IBM Cloud Satellite, is labeled as a “managed distributed cloud solution” that helps enterprise users to deploy and manage applications across edge, on-premises, and public cloud environments — regardless of vendor. 
Few other cloud platforms have fully tapped into the multicloud space, due to the difficulty of managing differently designed environments, but IBM Cloud Satellite is an IBM investment that delivers cloud services, regulatory and policy features, APIs, and security controls across disparate operational infrastructures.
Cloud Category: IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS
Key Features:

Cloud Satellite for multicloud development
Cloud Block Storage
Watson AI tools
Cloud Pak for automation

Key Features From Cloud Vendors
Data Analytics
With so many core enterprise applications hosted on the cloud, it’s important that the platform offers robust analytics and data visualizations to assess application performance. Look for platforms that offer easy-to-read dashboards and key analytics and monitoring metrics.
AI/ML
Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasingly being added to cloud platforms, helping enterprise developers to test and deploy AI/ML tools on the cloud framework. As a bonus, many cloud platforms also offer AI/ML-powered security monitoring and automation features to users.
User Access Controls
Most enterprises need their cloud platform to be accessible to all employees, but different employees require different applications and different levels of access to sensitive data. Invest in a tool that provides advanced user access controls that sysadmins can update for different users and devices over time.
Security and Automation
Cloud providers, especially in the IaaS realm, typically double as cybersecurity providers, offering embedded or integrated applications that automate security monitoring across cloud infrastructure.
Scalable Storage
One of the core benefits of migrating enterprise assets to the cloud is the ability to scale tools and storage up and down as your company changes over time. Look at the baseline storage features your chosen platform offers, as well as the pay-as-you-go model offered for added storage.
Interoperability and Integrations
Especially for the cloud platforms that offer hybrid cloud or multicloud capabilities, it’s crucial that they offer interoperability and integrations with the key applications and tools your organization already uses.
Collaborative Workspaces
Because the cloud offers real-time updates and easy access for enterprise users, many cloud platforms offer collaborative workspaces and office suites where users can collaboratively update company assets.

Tips for Choosing a Cloud Vendor
Cost to Implement
The great thing about cloud solutions is that enterprise users can easily scale up or down with the tools they need. Really consider what tools make the most sense for your business and whether your preferred vendor offers those solutions, and at what cost. The top cloud providers tend to offer the highest costs for initial infrastructure and add-ons. But they also offer the widest portfolio of solutions.
Hybrid Cloud and Multicloud Flexibility
Not all cloud solutions are created equally when it comes to hybrid cloud and multicloud flexibility. When choosing a cloud vendor, ask yourself the following questions: Are they willing to assist with the transition from your legacy systems and data centers to their cloud? Do they offer solutions that allow you to keep and connect legacy systems to their products?
Cloud Application Library
Whether embedded or added via integrations, it’s important to consider which cloud vendors offer the most useful suite of cloud applications for your particular business line and use cases. The largest providers tend to offer very similar core products and solutions. But each of them offers different specialties, partnerships with outside vendors, and industry-specific solutions that could benefit your organization.
Cloud Security Features
The cloud makes it possible for your team and solutions to work in a more distributed environment. But as a result, security also needs to become more distributed to protect your global network. Does your chosen cloud vendor offer native cloud security, or do they partner with top cloud security providers? Do they offer a dashboard, analytics, and other helpful visuals so your internal team can stay on top of potential threats?
Who Needs Cloud Solutions?
The modern enterprise technology landscape is reaching a point where virtually every company uses cloud solutions of some fashion for their business, But if you’re still not certain whether cloud technology can benefit your business, consider investing in the cloud if you’re looking for:

Simplified, remote access to company assets for employees
Automated and distributed security solutions that can be easily monitored
The ability to easily scale your storage and business applications
Stronger disaster recovery and quality control features
Easier access to emerging technologies, such as edge computing, AI, ML, and IoT

It’s likely that most workforces and enterprise projects will continue to operate in globally distributed locations. Although cloud computing companies and their solutions aren’t the only paths to successful management of a global enterprise, the cloud is quickly becoming the preferred method for uniting enterprise teams in an accessible, flexible, and secure environment.

Artificial intelligence and other major disruptive technologies have infiltrated the global tech business to improve production and yield. 
Multiple AI models are being used in organizations and factories to automate processes and generate significant in-depth insights. What if artificial intelligence leads to job losses shortly of technology? How will human employees make enough money to live a normal life? People are asking these kinds of concerns as robots and AI models automate operations and deal with large amounts of data rapidly and effectively.
Do we have a backup plan in place if artificial intelligence causes significant job losses in the coming years? 
Organizations and manufacturers are just following the crowd and implementing disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, robotics, augmented reality, and others. They’re concentrating on task automation and increasing income while improving client happiness. Is this, however, sufficient to ensure that there will be no unemployment? Although there will be harmony in human-machine contact, millions of employees may probably lose their jobs in the next years as a result of these smart functions.
Scientists and developers are continually arguing that there will only be a hybrid workforce in which humans and machines collaborate for the benefit of both the company and society. Human personnel cannot be replaced by cutting-edge technologies since they are required for new levels of innovation. Humans are known for their creative brains, clear communication, and empathy, all of which can result in a wide range of inventiveness that can improve consumer engagement. Meanwhile, AI models are known for their ability to manage large amounts of data and generate in-depth insights. Humans are designed for creative labor, whereas machines are designed for mechanical activity. To thrive in this cutthroat competitive environment, businesses need a mix of both. This will help to prevent future job losses due to AI.
There are a variety of educational courses dedicated to training students and working professionals to be experts in various career categories linked to artificial intelligence and the creation of AI models, including AI architects, AI engineers, and many others. There are numerous options for them to retrain and reskill to improve their current abilities. 
As a fall-back strategy, displaced human workers can focus on making a living in industries that technology cannot reach, which will provide some job stability for a while. However, no one can claim that there is a backup plan in this situation because the future is unpredictable. Nobody knows what skills will be required for job jobs related to technological advancements such as artificial intelligence.The future is impossible to foretell.
