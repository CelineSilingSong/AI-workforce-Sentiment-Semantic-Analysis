The future is now: artificial intelligence and anticipatory humanitarian action

August 19, 2021, Analysis / Humanitarian Action / New Technologies 7 mins read                        
Christopher Chen  Associate Research Fellow, Centre for Non-Traditional Security Studies 




 
As the world faces simultaneous disasters and burgeoning risks, humanitarian actors need to develop more efficient ways of delivering aid to vulnerable populations. One current trend involves the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to process large amounts of data quickly to inform – and even autonomously undertake – decision-making processes. While these processes have the potential to facilitate faster and better anticipatory humanitarian action, they can pose unforeseen challenges if left unregulated and unchecked.
In this post, Christopher Chen, Associate Research Fellow at the Centre for Non-Traditional Security Studies, explores the promise and perils of using artificial intelligence and machine learning in the context of anticipatory humanitarian action. Building on insights gleaned from a data governance and protection workshop co-hosted by the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies and the ICRC, he highlights some of the implications of the use of new technologies in humanitarian action and how the principle of ‘do no harm’ can be applied in a digital age.

ICRC Humanitarian Law & Policy Blog · The future is now: artificial intelligence and anticipatory humanitarian action
Speaking on the need for a more proactive humanitarian system, Sir Mark Lowcock, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, stated in 2019 that ‘[t]he best way to [address gaps] is to change our current system from one that reacts, to one that anticipates’.
Heeding this call, aid workers and organizations have been trying to use new and emerging technologies to facilitate earlier, faster, and potentially more effective humanitarian action. Part of this technological shift involves the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the efficiency of humanitarian responses and field operations.
However, such a promise is also accompanied by potential pitfalls. Inadequate data governance and data protection might cause unintended harm to vulnerable populations, while poor artificial intelligence and machine learning implementation can exacerbate and intensify existing bias and inequalities. As such, these risks and challenges must be identified and mitigated to ensure that the use of new technology does no harm and protects the life and dignity of those it is intended to serve.
Future-proofing the aid sector?
Embracing innovation is part and parcel of future-proofing the humanitarian sector. Future-proofing refers to the process of anticipating future shocks and stresses and developing methods to minimize their adverse effects. AI/ML-based interventions contribute to this by automating and positively impacting various aspects of humanitarian work.
The ICRC defines Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems as ‘computer programs that carry out tasks – often associated with human intelligence – that require cognition, planning, reasoning or learning’. It also defines Machine Learning (ML) systems as ‘AI systems that are “trained” on and “learn” from data, which ultimately define the way they function’. An example of this is IBM’s ML system that analyzes drivers of migration and uses the data to forecast cross-border movements and refugee flows. As a UN OCHA report states, these systems can facilitate analysis and interpretation of large and complex humanitarian datasets to improve projections and decision-making in humanitarian settings.
AI may be harnessed to improve workflows and optimize the disbursement of aid. For example, in July 2020, predictive analytics frameworks implemented by the UN and other partner organizations forecasted severe flooding along the Jamuna River in Bangladesh. In response, UN OCHA’s Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) allocated and released funding – roughly $5.2 million – to several humanitarian agencies, which enabled them to provide humanitarian assistance to vulnerable populations before flooding reached critical levels. This was CERF’s fastest-ever disbursement of funds in a crisis.
This illustrates how developments in AI/ML and predictive analytics make it possible to anticipate when disasters are about to strike. This facilitates a more proactive, anticipatory approach to humanitarian action and enables humanitarians to deliver more timely assistance to populations.
Caveat emptor: risks to vulnerable populations
While aid agencies might benefit from the use of AI/ML, these technologies can inadvertently bring risks to vulnerable populations. Without the right safeguards, AI/ML could exacerbate inequalities and further marginalize vulnerable groups.
Consider the scenario where AI/ML processes are used to identify suitable target populations for a particular humanitarian programme. What happens if the algorithm, for some reason, decides that certain people – who would usually be entitled to participate in the programme – should be excluded? Learned bias in AI/ML can lead to the further discrimination of vulnerable populations. This is far from a hypothetical, as over the past few years, there have been many high-profile cases of ML systems demonstrating racial and gender biases. A study in 2019 found that face recognition technologies across 189 algorithms are least accurate on women of colour. It is easy to see how this can be problematic in a humanitarian setting, where vulnerable populations might be subjected to such biases and their corresponding effects, that is, discriminatory disbursement of aid and false positives in the identification of missing people.
AI also needs substantial amounts of quality data to be trained effectively. However, humanitarians often work in places where accurate data on populations are inaccessible. Political contexts might also prevent the collection of sensitive datasets. This makes the training of AI/ML processes particularly difficult. Without access to quality data sets, AI/ML systems cannot be trained and used in a way that avoids amplifying the risks identified above.
These challenges underscore the importance of users having a healthy skepticism when they engage with AI/ML processes. The reality is that it is difficult to code for values; fairness and justice cannot be automated.
Ghosts in the machine
We live in an age of rapid technological progress. While technologies like AI/ML can make humanitarian work better and more effective, they might also unexpectedly evolve past its original intended purposes, thus threatening the very populations that humanitarians are trying to protect. As such, humanitarians need to realistically assess the capabilities and limitations of AI/ML.
The implementation of AI/ML projects in humanitarian settings should be carried out equitably; partnerships and programmes should not be decided solely by stakeholders from Geneva and New York. This requires active engagement with practitioners on the ground and recipients of aid to identify capacity and systemic gaps. Humanitarian organizations using AI/ML in their work must build feedback loops into their processes for monitoring and evaluation purposes.
At a recent workshop hosted by the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies and the International Committee of the Red Cross, discussions centred around the opportunities and risks of using new technologies in humanitarian action, as well as the importance of data governance protocols. In the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning breakout group, participants acknowledged the need for humanitarians to adopt a human-centric approach when using AI and ML.
Especially in situations involving vulnerable and at-risk populations, human control and judgement in applications of AI/ML should be prioritized. AI and ML systems should only be used to augment analytical processes; it should not replace the human element involved in decision-making. This will help to preserve a level of ethical accountability and ensure that digital transformation in the sector takes place in a fair and ethical manner.
The most important takeaway is that, while guidelines or legislative frameworks are important elements of an ethical and safe AI/ML ecosystem, they need to be underpinned by a human-centred approach.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the hottest topics in marketing right now. Raj Venkatesan and Jim Lecinski recently published a book entitled “The AI Marketing Canvas: A Five-Stage Road Map to Implementing Artificial Intelligence in Marketing”. To better understand what an AI marketing canvas is, I sought insight from Raj Venkatesan, a professor at the Darden School of Business. In full disclosure, I work with Raj and find his research and work fascinating. Below is insight on the AI marketing canvas.


Kimberly A. Whitler: Why did you and Jim write this book?

Raj Venkatesan: We heard and experienced the rise of data and algorithms. Marketing professionals had started to pay attention to this, and they wanted to invest in this new technology. But they were struggling with the why and the how questions. They needed guidance on the ultimate objective of using AI in marketing, i.e., how is marketing—and  customer relationships—going to improve from using AI. There were books written at a very high level regarding whether machines would take over. You know, is the Matrix going to take over, or for the younger people, are we all going to be in Halladay’s game, the Oasis, like Ready Player. On the other hand, there were books written around 10 steps to better email marketing. Very granular, but again not at the strategic level a senior marketing profession would want to use AI. So, we set out writing a book, that we feel is like the goldilocks solution, not too high, and not too granular.

Whitler: How do you explain what AI means to a marketer?

Venkatesan: My philosophy is to use AI to supercharge the customer experience through personalization at scale. I frequent this Chinese restaurant near Darden, Peter Chang. They greet me by my name, know where I like to sit, what I like to order, and when I call them, they know exactly what I would want. They know my kids and family etc. Now this family that owns Peter Chang might know their regular customers intimately and would be able to remember about 200 of their regular customers if they are REALLY GOOD. AI is about taking this level of personalization to 10s of millions of customers. Brands like Chick-fil-a, and Starbucks are trying to achieve this personalization using AI in their mobile apps and translating the insights from the app into personalized in-store customer experiences also. So, SBux knows what drinks I like, what sandwiches I normally get, they might know that I have kids (because my son loves the Vanilla Bean Fappacino and Cake Pop), if ordered ahead on the mobile app, the barrista can address me by my name etc.
PROMOTED
An effective strategy is to use AI to personalize each aspect of customer engagement; acquisition, retention, growth, and advocacy (or word of mouth). Modern marketing is about using first party consumer data and algorithms to personalize the firms’ marketing for acquisition, retention, growth and advocacy. The idea is to put the customer in the center and use AI to enhance the customer’s experience with the brand.
Whitler: In your book you propose a five-stage roadmap for including AI in your marketing strategy. Can you explain?
Venkatesan: The five-step roadmap provides marketing managers a tool to plan and develop their AI marketing strategy. It consists of five steps; foundation, experimentation, expansion, transformation, and monetization. Foundation is about collecting relevant first party data that is the essential input for any AI algorithm. In the experimentation stage, a firm attempts to personalize one aspect of customer engagement. In the expansion stage, the firm personalizes more than one aspect of customer engagement, and in the transformation stage, all aspects of customer engagement are personalized. In the monetization stage, the firm uses all the developed AI capabilities to develop a services/software platform that provides on-demand services to other business, thereby developing a new revenue stream.

Whitler: Which industries can hope to achieve maximum impact?
Venkatesan: Firms that have a direct to consumer of customer relationship can achieve the maximum impact. AI in marketing requires good data that are directly collected from the consumers, i.e., first party data. In the research for our book we found that firms across industries, including consumer packaged goods, banks, B2B firms, retailers (online as well as brick and mortar), technology firms, pharmaceutical firms, travel and hospitality industries, media, and software, are using AI in their marketing strategies.

Whitler: What are some tips for an early-stage startup to use AI in marketing?
Venkatesan: The roadmap talks about a small steps approach. You should start with the experimentation stage, work with a vendor to first evaluate personalization in SEO/SEM. Website and customer service personalization. Salesperson call patterns of customers etc. If it works out, you can build more in the expansion stage. You have the advantage of no legacy costs when collecting first party data.

Artificial intelligence ""will empower designers"" say Clippings co-founders

Technology will allow architects and designers to spend more time designing and less time doing admin, according to Adel Zakout and Tom Mallory of furniture-sourcing platform Clippings.



The duo, who this week announced the sale of their business to US samples service Material Bank, said that architecture and design is ""is one of the few remaining sectors that really has not been touched significantly by technology.""
But this is finally changing, they added.
""I believe that in 10 years, interior designers and architects will be doing more designing,"" said Zakout (above, left), who co-founded the London-based platform with Mallory (right) in 2014.
""Today, interior designers and architects are spending 60 to 80 per cent of their time just doing admin like emails, Excel sheets, putting quotes together and just managing stuff,"" he added.



""Unfortunately, that's part of the job today because technology hasn't caught up,"" he said. ""Technology has not enabled them to save time and focus on where they can add value. But in 10 years time, designers will be able to design more"" thanks to technology.
Pandemic ""accelerated"" way of thinking about technology
Mallory added that the coronavirus pandemic has ""drastically shifted"" attitudes to technology in the sector.
""The pandemic certainly has accelerated the way people are thinking about distribution channels and how technology can be a part of it,"" he said.

Clippings handles the selection, purchase and delivery of furniture, lighting and other products for architecture and interior projects, while the brand's new parent Material Bank offers North American architects overnight delivery of a wide range of material samples.
Services like these will allow architects and interior designers to focus on their design work, the duo believes.
AI ""is incredibly powerful""
They disagreed with claims that artificial intelligence will make designers redundant.
Two years ago, New York designer Sebastian Errazuriz warned that AI would eliminate the majority of creative jobs in architecture.
""I think it's important that architects are warned as soon as possible that 90 per cent of their jobs are at risk,"" he said.
But Zakout said: ""I actually think it'll be the opposite. I think artificial intelligence will empower designers. I think that AI, especially for repetitive work, is incredibly powerful. But fundamentally, the creative process that designers go through will be quite difficult to replace with AI.""

""I do believe that AI will have a huge impact on the process,"" he added. ""It'll make things like discovery, the procurement process, matching the products in the general workflow much easier and quicker.""
""I think technology will do a lot to enhance the process but I don't believe that I will replace the designer.""
Covid-19 forced brands to adopt tech
Zakout agreed that the coronavirus pandemic forced furniture and lighting brands to come to terms with technology.
""A lot of brands woke up last March and realised that their whole distribution channels had been shut down,"" he said. ""Their whole method of distributing their products, marketing, selling their products, was no longer available.""
This led them to embrace digital solutions for the first time, he added.
""There has been a drastic mentality shift,"" he said. ""Businesses like Herman Miller [now MillerKnoll] are starting to sell directly to customers,"" via the Herman Miller Professional portal that it built in conjunction with Clippings.
""So I think things are accelerating. Covid has definitely been a bit of a trigger. It's been a kick for some brands to really move on with their plans.""

Machine learning (ML) is a continuously evolving process that requires large, diverse and carefully labeled datasets for training ML algorithms. But, collecting and labeling datasets with millions of elements drawn from the real world is time-consuming and expensive. This has vaulted synthetic data into the spotlight as the favored tool for training purposes. Let’s see how synthetic data offers a reprieve from the data quality conundrum and reshape large-scale ML deployments.
Enterprises want to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) more than ever. A 2021 surveyOpens a new window  by Algorithmia found that 76% of organizations prioritize AI/ML over other IT initiatives, while 71% have increased their annual spending on AI/ML. Opens a new window 
The only flip side to it is that many ML projects never come to fruition. A 2020 survey by International Data Corporation (IDC) found that 28% of the 2,000 IT decision-makers involved had witnessed their AI/ML initiatives fail. Opens a new window 
In a similar vein, a 2021 report by Wakefield Research for Alation found around 87% of respondents identified data quality issues as the biggest hurdle to successfully implementing AI in their organizations. Bad data has already cost businesses trillions of dollars. IBM estimates bad data has cost the U.S. more than $3 trillion every year. Opens a new window 
Generating good quality training data for machine learning can be tricky. Errors in measurement or poor understanding of the requirements of the machine learning model can erode data quality. There are various ways in which data scientists are trying to address this issue. One solution is to cleanse data before feeding them to the machine learning algorithm. However, this can take a lot of time.
On the other hand, synthetic data is a lot more cost-effective and less time-intensive. More importantly, it improves the data quality critical to the effectiveness of a machine learning model and the success of the project.
“Synthetic data is very effective at improving data quality in learning models, and we have experienced success using it. It can be challenging obtaining real production data, and when we do, it frequently needs close scrutiny to remove errors and ensure accuracy of labeling. Additionally, the data invariably requires significant redaction,” says Richard Whitehead, chief evangelist and CTO at Moogsoft, an AIOps company.
With more ML practitioners throwing their weight behind synthetic data, its implementation is expected to grow further. Gartner predicts, by 2024, the use of synthetic data and transfer learning will limit the volume of real-world data needed for machine learning by half.
IDC also observes that the use of synthetic data for machine learning has been steadily increasing, particularly in use cases that may not have precedence or sufficient past data (such as autonomous driving, computer vision, etc.). It is expected that the majority of the data used for AI/ ML projects would be synthetic in the next five years.

What Is Synthetic Data?
Synthetic data refers to information generated through computer simulations instead of being collected or measured in the real world.
Though it’s artificial, it is supposed to reflect real-world data and have the same mathematical and statistical properties. Unlike real-world data, ML practitioners have complete sovereignty over the synthetic dataset. This allows them to control the degree of labeling, sampling size, and noise levels. This also helps address privacy and security concerns where using real-world data involves sensitive and personal information of users. This makes it a lot easier for ML practitioners to publish, share, and analyze synthetic datasets with a wider ML community without worrying about exposing personally identifiable information and facing the ire of data protection authorities. 
Synthetic data has seen a lot of traction in self-driving vehicles, robotics, healthcare, cybersecurity and fraud protection. Google and Uber have been leveraging them extensively to improve the autonomy levels in their self-driven cars. Likewise, Amazon reportedly uses synthetic data to train Alexa’s language tool.
Synthetic data can be classified into three categories: fully synthetic data, hybrid synthetic data and partially synthetic data.
When it comes to synthetic data generation, there are various techniques to build and perfect synthetic datasets in line with the complexity of the use case. Less complicated options include statistical modeling and Monte Carlo simulations, while the more complex options include engine-based simulation, agent-based synthetic data generation and generative adversarial networks (GAN).
Monte Carlo simulation is a mathematical technique that carries out risk analysis by building models of possible results by substituting a range of values. Agent-based synthetic data generation first creates a physical model of real-world data, then reproduces random data using the same model.
GAN pits two neural networks against each other. The first network, called a generator, is entrusted with creating synthetic data from random input. The second network, called the discriminator, tries to tell whether the input data is real or not. The discriminator is trained using both real and fake data.
“The core intuition is that synthetic data — by virtue of being artificially generated — allows us to introduce knowledge into AI models that we wouldn’t be able to incorporate via real data,’’ says Farhan Choudhary, Principal Analyst at Gartner.
Choudhary explains, “Many AI, machine learning and analytics projects suffer from delays caused by obtaining production data for development and testing. Synthetic data generation helps reduce the bias in datasets by representing data with appropriate balance, density, distribution and other parameters, ultimately solving the data quality problem in ML projects.’’
According to Gartner, synthetic data can:

Introduce domain-specific knowledge in the training of AI models, thereby improving the quality of model predictions.
Complete datasets where data is scarce, unavailable, unbalanced and can also be used to generate unknown scenarios for better model training.
Help in testing complex AI models and increase their robustness.
Address combinatorial explosion, especially in portfolio optimization and initiative sequencing business problems, where real data is impossible to obtain.

Complexities of Synthetic Data
Though adoption has been growing, generating and using synthetic data to train machine learning algorithms and finding people with the right skills to support it can be challenging.
Choudhary points out that the quality of the generated synthetic data depends on the model that generates the data; hence, not all approaches will yield high-quality results.
“Depending on the approach, synthetic data can still reveal sensitive information, can miss natural anomalies, or not even contribute any significant value over and above the already existing real world data, therefore understanding a wider variety of approaches is recommended,’’ he adds.
Sriram Subramanian, primary analyst for AI ML lifecycle software at IDC, believes synthetic data is not a panacea. It’s effectiveness depends on various factors such as the source of the data, accuracy of the generation algorithms and how close it is to real data.
“Some of the complexities include finding the right source, efforts and time involved, the possibility of bias introduction, and trustworthiness of the generated data,’’ Subramanian adds.

Best Practices to Use Synthetic Data
To get the most out of synthetic data, ML practitioners should keep a few things in mind. First of all, they need to ensure the dataset adequately emulates their use case. Whitehead suggests they need to ensure that the dataset adequately represents the production environment in terms of both complexity and comprehensiveness of examples.
They also need to ensure the data is clean. “Since the data is synthesized, this is more to do with making sure there are no bugs in the generation. When possible, have subject matter experts validate the dataset,’’ he adds.
ML practitioners also need to accept that application of synthetic data may not work in all use cases. Choudhary cautions that the opportunity needs to be evaluated first to determine if synthetic data can potentially solve the problem.
He also weighs in favor of upskilling within the organization to utilize synthetic generation techniques and collaboration with researchers, academia, and startups working on the topic.
Subramanian feels that companies should have an enterprise-wide data intelligence strategy and invest in the right tools for DataOps and data labeling solutions. 
Conclusion  
Machine learning is highly sensitive to bad quality input data. By leveraging synthetic data, ML practitioners are beginning to address this gap. Unlike real-world data, synthetic data has been found to be more reliable and cost-effective to generate. Many experts feel it is even better than real-world data for training purposes.  
As the application of synthetic data has grown, so has awareness about it. More companies from different sectors including computing, healthcare, banking and automobile now want to tap it to improve their machine learning-based products and services.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly seen as a must-have technology that enables businesses to become agile and innovate at scale. IDC predicts global spending on artificial intelligence (AI) systems will increase from US $50 billion in 2020 to US $110 billion in 2024.
But Gartner research estimates that 50 percent of AI implementations are struggling to get past the proof-of-concept stage and be implemented at scale. The reasons vary from overhyped expectations and lack of vision to inadequate data infrastructure and lack of skilled resources.
Another important factor is the team that’s working on the AI programs. While AI teams may have the requisite tools and technologies, many lack other key capabilities – like mining for the right use cases and optimizing decision-making – that are essential for success.

Successful AI teams that work at enterprise scale share the following traits:
1. They frame the problem well
Teams need to be able to sift through the complexities of the situation to frame the core of the problem accurately before they get to the right solution. This means playing the role of translator and bridging the gap between technology and the business case. It involves diving deep into data to make unexpected connections and find insights that shine a brighter light on the problem.
Along with understanding data and algorithms, successful teams also exhibit empathy for customers and other users, which helps in solving problems holistically. They are creative and curious; they look at the world from an exploratory perspective and are unafraid to challenge the status quo. These traits enable them to constantly consider how their work impacts the business that they are innovating for. Along with understanding data and algorithms, successful teams also exhibit empathy for customers and other users, which helps in solving problems holistically.
2. They think enterprise-scale right from the start
In most instances, AI pilot programs show promising results but then fail to scale. Accenture surveys point to 84 percent of C-suite executives acknowledging that scaling AI is important for future growth, but a whopping 76 percent also admit that they are struggling to do so.
The only way to realize the full potential of AI is by scaling it across the enterprise. Unfortunately, some AI teams think only in terms of executing a workable prototype to establish proof-of-concept, or at best transform a department or function.
Teams that think enterprise-scale at the design stage can go successfully from pilot to enterprise-scale production. They often build and work on ML-Ops platforms to standardize the ML lifecycle and build a factory line for data preparation, cataloguing, model management, AI assurance, and more.
3. They democratize AI and are diverse
AI technologies demand huge compute and storage capacities, which often only large, sophisticated organizations can afford. Because resources are limited, AI access is privileged in most companies. This compromises performance because fewer minds mean fewer ideas, fewer identified problems, and fewer innovations. In fact, the more diverse the team, the better it is at uncovering problems and making data connections.
At Infosys, we have addressed this by leveraging an AI cloud as a strategic platform for scaling computing resources and sharing knowledge to make AI accessible to all. We’ve also added diverse roles and skills within the AI team – not just technical like data scientists, data engineers, and machine learning experts, but also those with business domain, product management, user interface design, and software engineering skills.
With the AI cloud, we can now build larger and more able pools of expertise in AI because we are able to scale the computing resources needed to include more of our workforce in our AI programs as well as build more mission-critical AI applications. Ultimately, democratizing AI leads to better project outcomes.
4. They keenly appreciate the ethics of AI

Finding use cases, building AI systems at enterprise-scale, and democratizing adoption is but half the battle. Managing the ethical dimensions of AI implementations is serious business that involves input from regulators and policymakers too. The AI team must understand what it takes to work within the framework of regulatory compliance. They need to implement strong and auditable risk management practices throughout AI development, validation, and monitoring to build unbiased, interpretable, accountable, and reproducible AI systems that deliver business outcomes that are fair and transparent.
Truly, AI is as much about people as it is about programming.

Only three years ago the rate was closer to 70K applications a year. Using patentguru.com, I reviewed the frequency of U.S. patent publications and patent application publications for the following terms in their title: “machine-learning” or “machine learning” or “data analysis” or “analytics” or “computer program product” or “artificial intelligence” or “data science” or “neural network.” The more general terms of “analytics” and “computer program product” were included as only the patent titles were reviewed not the body of the patent text.It is possible a small amount of non-ML/AI patents are included but manual inspection of the resulting patents determined these search terms gave good results. The top assignee for the patents was IBM, followed by Qualcomm, Samsung, Intel, Microsoft, Google, Huawei, and Apple.How are Patents Organized?Patents need to be filed into a particular category. These categories were created a long time ago, before computer work products were something that needed a category. For this reason you will find most US Patent Office ML/AI type patents in category G: Physics, but they can be found in any category depending on the domain the invention is applied on.A: Human NecessitiesB: Performing Operations, TransportingC: Chemistry, MetallurgyD: Textiles, PaperE: Fixed ConstructionsF: Mechanical Engineering, Lighting, Heating, WeaponsG: PhysicsH: ElectricityHow to Get More Information On A Particular Class of PatentsWithin each class there are subclasses, with G06F the most common for the US Patent Office ML/AI patents.Using www.patbase.com, I reviewed information on the category G06N. This is a category where I recently filed a machine learning patent application. The results here are for all patents and applications in the class, not just the machine learning related ones.PatBase Analytics Results for G06NThe top assignee for the category of computer systems based on specific computational models is IBM, which has twice the number of patents as the next closest assignees Microsoft, Google, and Samsung. In this evaluation I did not limit to U.S. patents and so you will see the distribution of assignees globally.Many of these applications are for Chinese patents, followed by the United States.The number of patent applications in 2020 and 2021 for G06N, across all countries, is experiencing dramatic growth. This is just one of the multiple categories where machine learning and AI patents can be filed.How do I write a patent of my very own?You don’t. Your patent attorney does it for you. Only a patent attorney or a very dedicated inventor would attempt to write a patent. Your company can hire a patent attorney to help you, if they are dedicated to the concept of patenting their intellectual property and want to protect your project. The cost is not insignificant, and it is entirely possible that your company may prefer to keep your work as a “trade secret” rather than patent it. Assuming your patent is for work associated with an employer, your name will appear on the patent, but the “assignee” of the patent will be your employer.Publication of your work, rather than pursuing a patent, is another path that can be taken. This may be preferable if the goal is to establish a reputation as an expert, as well as the dissemination of general knowledge, rather than specific protection of the work.In order to proceed with patenting your work, you need to be able to demonstrate that your work is novel, non-obvious, and useful. You should create documents to explain your invention in layman’s terms. It should clearly explain your work, and what aspect of the work you are trying to protect. You are not able to patent abstract concepts, there must be a practical application to your invention. Your attorneys will be able to search for “prior art” to confirm your claims. While you can also search for “prior art”, keep in mind that you are required to disclose any findings that you have from such a search. When the patent is written, it will contain exactly that — “claims”. These claims describe exactly what your invention is composed of and are the most important part of the patent. They will also decide which class and subclass your patent should be submitted to, and the type of patent you will file.It can be a bit disorienting to see your invention parsed into legalese that is difficult for even you to understand, and accompanied by unfamiliar diagrams. Apparently this is exactly what the patent office is looking for, so at this point you need to trust your attorneys. You also need to ensure that they have clearly understood your invention as they wrote it up and that the claims do in fact represent what you are trying to patent. Different claims can be associated with different inventors, so this is where you can designate which inventor contributed to the various aspects of the overall invention.Can I make money from my patent?Probably not. Also, your employer will probably not make any money from it either. Patents can be used to increase the intrinsic value of a company, and demonstrate their position as an innovative leader, even where no actual monetary value is associated with a specific patent. Also, the patent protects your product from being patented by someone else. Many patents are filed without a specific plan to monetize the invention being protected.New AI Data From The USPTOThe US Patent Office has recently released a dataset of AI related patents. This dataset was compiled based upon a more comprehensive method of classifying patents than was used in this article.

AI accountability: Who's responsible when AI goes wrong?


Who should be held accountable when AI misbehaves? The users, the creators, the vendors? It's not clear, but experts have some ideas.

AI systems sometimes run amok.
One chatbot, designed by Microsoft to mimic a teenager, began spewing racist hate speech within hours of its release online. Microsoft immediately took the bot down.







Another system, which Amazon designed to help its recruiting efforts but ultimately didn't release, inadvertently discriminated against female applicants.
Other so-called ""smart"" systems have led to false arrests, biased bail amounts for criminal defendants, and even fatal car crashes.
Experts expect to see more cases of problematic AI as organizations increasingly implement intelligent technology, sometimes doing so without adopting the proper governance in place. A governance framework, and extra attention to AI ethical concerns, can help prevent unintended biases and algorithmic drift in AI models.  
""There will be large systemic disruptions and therefore large benefits to those who lead with AI. But along with that comes responsibility to set up guidelines and transparency in the work you do,"" said Sanjay Srivastava, chief digital officer at professional services firm Genpact.
""If you use AI, you cannot separate yourself from the liability or the consequences of those uses,"" he said.
Most organizations don't have the proper guidelines in place, however.
The lack of standardized guidance around AI governance, and the complexity of deep learning and machine learning models, has made it difficult for experts to decide who to blame when an AI system goes wrong.

Creating AI accountability
Creating ethical AI requires attention to three broad and interrelated areas, according to experts: functional performance, the data it uses and how the system itself is used.
Take the first bucket -- functional performance. Organizations generally use AI-type technologies, which includes machine learning and natural language processing, to analyze data and make predictions. But all the components within AI need to function properly for the system to produce accurate, fair and legal decisions.
For example, a credit card fraud detection system must use finely tuned algorithms to protect customers against unauthorized use of their credit cards but not decline when people make unusual yet legitimate purchases. A system that lets an unauthorized use slip by, or makes too many false positives, could destroy customers' trust in it.
The second area deals with data -- more specifically, ensuring that a high volume of high-quality data is used when training and using AI. Systems work best when they have clean, unbiased data to work with, especially when they have a lot of it.
Organizations also should safeguard that data against unauthorized access and use.
The third bucket deals with preventing unintended biases -- that is, ensuring that the data fed into the algorithms, as well as the algorithms themselves, do not produce results that discriminate.
In the case of Amazon's biased hiring model, the company used resumes it had accrued over the past decade to train the model. Most of the resumes were submitted by men during that time, so the model inherently tried to hire more men than women. That setup created what could have been a legal problem if Amazon hadn't caught the biased decisions.
Similarly, creating ethical AI and AI accountability also means safeguarding against unintended uses. Most AI systems are designed for a specific use case; using them for a different use case would produce incorrect results. For example, an AI-based system designed to optimize crop yields for wheat farmers can't just be transferred to advise rice farmers looking to maximize their yields.
Organizations attentive to all three of those areas, and the nuances within each of them, are more likely to have AI-based systems that produce accurate and fair results, Srivastava said. Those organizations are also more likely to identify early when their systems aren't working well, creating a level of accountability above less attentive organizations.



The potential for something to go wrong can come out of left field.


Mike Loukides Vice president of content strategy, O'Reilly Media






No guarantees of AI success, responsibility
Even if an AI creator follows those guidelines, it's no guarantee that the creating organization would be held accountable if problems result from AI use.
""The potential for something to go wrong can come out of left field,"" said Mike Loukides, vice president of content strategy at O'Reilly Media, a business and technology training company.
So, what happens when AI systems drift away from producing accurate and fair results? Or what happens if they never produced them in the first place? Who is accountable for the consequences that ensue?
It's not clear.
""The idea of accountability is that if something goes wrong then someone's job is on the line, but that's not the case here in most companies. I'd like to think, though, it's at least someone's job to fix it,"" Loukides said.
Other experts shared that observation, noting several reasons for the lack of clear accountability with problematic AI.
Experts pointed to the relative newness of AI and its use within businesses, explaining that many corporate leaders aren't yet attuned to all that can go wrong when using this technology.
Organizations don't always have the expertise to create and maintain fair and accurate AI-based systems, said Brandon Purcell, vice president and principal analyst at the research firm Forrester. Moreover, they may not even know where their responsibilities versus other contributors' responsibilities exist within an intelligent technology ecosystem.
""For most companies, the supply chain for AI is very long and complicated,"" Purcell said.
He points to self-driving vehicles: Many different companies contribute to the intelligent systems that power self-driving vehicles. For example, different companies could potentially contribute data, label data and build computer vision models. Each company could blame another when something goes wrong, Purcell said.
The legal system could help sort out AI accountability, with many lawsuits around these issues, he said.
But by implementing stringent AI governance policies, companies could get ahead of lawsuit scenarios.
""This is an opportunity to codify your ethical standards,"" Purcell said.
Take IBM, for example, where AI accountability and ethics are made up of several pieces, according to Seth Dobrin, the company's chief AI officer.
IBM approaches AI accountability by deeming that the company alone is accountable for its AI, and everyone involved in the process of creating the scope, designing, deploying and managing that AI at IBM is responsible for it, he said.
To Dobrin, AI accountability and ethics means that the AI is transparent and explainable. It's fair, meaning free of unintended and unacceptable biases. It's robust in that it holds up to external pressures such as cybersecurity attacks. In addition, the AI system respects privacy, for example, by preserving the anonymity of the people it affects. And it respects and adheres to relevant regulations, he said.


Regulations on accountable AI on their way
Organizations may see governments taking action on AI accountability by passing laws that establish certain requirements for companies using AI systems. Lawmakers could also enact policies to hold organizations accountable when AI systems do harm.
Indeed, some government regulations are already in the works, with the European Union leading the charge.
It's not clear, however, if such actions will effectively ensure ethical, trustworthy AI and hold organizations responsible when they fall short of AI guidelines.
Policymakers and technology experts debate over how much regulation to enact. Some experts believe too much regulation could limit technological creativity and advancement. Yet too little regulation could allow harmful AI systems to run rampant. Where to draw the line is still widely up to debate.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Robots can do repetitive tasks, perfectly and endlessly. This doesn't mean they are coming for your job though. The adaptability of human workers is something that robots just can't compete with. 




I’ll be the first to admit that my robot vacuum has made my life so much easier that I now own several – and wonder how I ever lived without them. (Full disclosure: I test tech products, so I didn’t have to pay for my favorite housemates.)
It’s not hard for me to embrace robot vacuums because I hate housework, so anything that moves that task off my plate is more than welcome. I get paid to write; I don’t get paid to do housework.
But if I did get paid to do housework, would I feel the same way?
Most – if not all – of our technological advances seem to create what is often viewed as a win/lose scenario: a win for consumers seeking convenience and/or for companies that want to cut costs and increase efficiency, but a loss for displaced employees and/or soon-to-be-obsolete industries.
Will the robots that make our lives easier also threaten our livelihoods?
Which Workers Are Likely To Be Displaced by Robots?
Before we starting talking about the jobs that are and continue to be taken over by robots, Ian Ferguson at Lynx Software Technologies, believes that it’s important to understand the unique strengths of both robots and human workers.Advertisements




“First, robots can be programmed to be strong, precise and fast, and they lack emotions, so they’ll never be bored.” As a result, Ferguson believes robots are ideal for certain types of tasks. “We are seeing robots take ownership of roles that would have put humans at risk on job sites that are underwater, underground, or behind enemy lines,” he says. And since the pandemic started, Ferguson notes that robots have been safely and efficiently dispensing medicine in hospitals – which keeps both patients and hospital workers safe. (Read also: Drones in 2020, What's Next?)
Steven Umbrello, managing director at the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies, agrees that robotic process automation (RPA) trends have only been exacerbated by the current pandemic, as companies look for ways to provide distance and safety. “We can see this particularly in the healthcare industry that has taken chatbots as a means of interfering between humans.” This reduces human interaction, but it also serves another purpose. “It justifies continued operation – underscoring the continued need to operate at a reduction of cost and strains on productivity, given the logistics and labor decline during the past year,” Umbrello explains.
For example, the pandemic severely disrupted U.S. supply chains, and in January, 2021, Bloomberg reported that some manufacturers reported absenteeism rates as high as 25%. That’s not something those companies want to experience again. (Read also: Has a Global Pandemic Changed the World's View of AI?)
“These types of AI systems will not only continue, but will also be used as a means to justify to legislators and regulatory bodies the continued upscaling of production given the reduction of human-to-human interactions in confined spaces,” Umbrello says. The advantages are obvious – not a single robot called in sick, needed a COVID-19 test, or was required to maintain social distancing, so some companies view them as vital to long-term sustainability.
But it’s not just healthcare and potentially dangerous jobs that robots are overtaking. “Within the stock market alone, most independent brokers have been displaced and will continue to be displaced,” Umbrello says. “The vast majority of trades are done by fast trading algorithms that are capable of executing a number of trades that far exceeds that of any human agent.”
And perhaps that’s the surprising part. Most people have probably communicated with chatbots, so they knew that certain jobs, like customer service reps, were probably in danger. And a study by MIT revealed that from 1990 to 2007, every robot added in the manufacturing sector replaced approximately 3.3 workers. As the BBC reports, another study, by Oxford Economics, found that globally, 20 million manufacturing jobs will be lost by 2030 (1.5 million jobs in America).
However, even degreed professions, such as translators, journalists, radiologists, and even accountants and tax preparers could be in danger. And that’s because replacement has less to do with whether the job requires a college degree and more about the level of repetitive or formulaic work involved.
“This group includes highly educated white-collar workers such as accountants–many of whose mathematical work can now be done by smart applications (like Turbotax, for instance) –and paralegals–whose fact-checking, editing and formulation of routine documents can now be done by AI-based applications,” says Kevin LaGrandeur, Ph.D., a professor at the New York Institute of Technology, fellow at the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies, co-founder of the NY Posthuman Research Group, and author of Surviving the Machine Age. And Oxford economists warns that over the next 20 years, almost 40% of all jobs could be lost.
Working With Robots
Deloitte, which releases an annual human capital trends report, has coined the phrase “superteams” to describe groups of people and intelligent machines working together. Only 12% of leaders in Deloitte’s 2020 report said they planned on using AI to replace workers; 60% said they were using AI to assist workers.
LaGrandeur notes that some economists believe that only about 10% of jobs will be lost. “That’s because only certain tasks within jobs are being automated, which will leave those workers to fill their time with less automatable work.” As an example, he points to accountants who don’t have to spend so much time crunching numbers on tax returns, so they can instead use that time to actually counsel their clients.
“Another example is an innovation called the Roboglove, made by NASA and GM, to help reduce repetitive stress injuries on the automotive factory floor,” LaGrandeur says. “It gives an added 10 pounds of bionic force for holding tools, using sensors, simulated nerves, muscles, tendons, and is in prototype.”
However, LaGrandeur predicts that – as with previous industrial revolutions – there will be significant job losses in the transitional period, which should last about 20 years. “Thereafter, the new technology will create more jobs than it destroys, including new ones having to do with their care and creation, as well as jobs designed to be done by a team of robots – called ‘cobots’ and humans together.”
But how soon this will occur is still a matter of debate. Ferguson believes that many industry leaders (at least in the near future) envision workplaces where robots support, rather than uproot the human workforce. (Read also: 6 (Scary) Things AI Is Getting Better At Doing.)
“Robots are supporting doctors’ ability to focus more on patient care instead of retrieving and filing information.” And since factory robots are still relatively expensive and large, he believes automation will only gain widespread popularity on a specific criterion. “Only when — or if — the economics justify the purchase for the role that must be filled – for example, the task of building one thing, one way, forever.”
But Ferguson sees the current trend of personalization and customization as perhaps preventing robots from ever taking over completely. “Adjusting robots for new process flows is challenging, and downtime impacts factory output and effectiveness,” he says. “We are starting to see a new class of smaller, more cost-effective robots that, unlike traditional robots that are sequestered from humans, will work hand in hand with the human workforce.”
In November, 2020, Walmart announced that it was ending its robot inventory project, which used shelf-scanning robots to track inventory in the store’s aisles. Although Walmart previously said that automating inventory would reduce labor costs and provide more accurate inventory results, the company reversed its decision, opting to let employees handle this task. Score one for the humans.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Friday said the company's artificial-intelligence bots may one day be able to work on Mars, a vision seemingly ripped from the pages of sci-fi novels.Musk on Thursday announced that the company was working on a Tesla Bot with a human form that would co-opt some of the AI the company has developed for its electric vehicles. One of Musk's other companies, SpaceX, has been focused on returning humans to the Moon, then heading to Mars.

A Twitter user asked Musk if the bots would be mass-produced and sent to the Red Planet as laborers. ""Hopefully,"" Musk replied.

The tweet that Musk was replying to also said his bot project mirrored the efforts of a fictional scientist from Isaac Asimov's ""I, Robot"" books, a series that began publication in the 1950s. In those stories, humanoid robots work alongside humans.A Twitter user on Friday compared Musk with Lawrence Robertson, a character who cofounded U.S. Robotics and Mechanical Men, the fictional company that built humanoid robots. In ""I, Robot,"" Robertson said: ""The idea was to accustom people to working with one humanoid robot; and, once they realized the enormous potential, they would clamor for more.""On Thursday, Musk said: ""It has profound applications for the economy"" and ""in the future, physical work will be a choice.""

Tesla said the Bot would have cameras for eyes, and would use its self-driving software to navigate its surroundings. The company also said it would have a new Dojo chip — a supercomputer focused on machine learning. Read More: The startup that built Elon Musk's tiny house now has a 50,000-person wait list, even though its factory isn't running yet and it's only built 3 homes

Musk in announcing the Tesla robots on Thursday seemed to acknowledge concerns that the robots would turn violent, saying most people would be able to ""overpower"" the 125-pound bots. ""We're setting it such that it is at a mechanical level, at a physical level, you can run away from it and most likely overpower it,"" he said.

The public's fear of AI robots turning violent was natural, Asimov wrote in ""I, Robot."" One of his characters called the concern the ""The Frankenstein Complex.""""Far too many Hollywood movies portrayed them as unstoppable weapons that, invariably, turned upon their creators,"" Asimov wrote in the novel. ""Others panicked over the idea that robots might replace humans in usefulness, for jobs, perhaps even for procreation.""

As we continue to see growth in people launching their own businesses ranging from online courses through to coaching there is also a second wave of business evolving offering these entrepreneurs the infrastructure to do this whilst staying relatively lean. An area that has seen growth in recent years is lead generation. Whilst areas of digital marketing such as PPC (Pay-Per-Click) ads have continuously grown we’re now seeing traditional forms of marketing such as cold calling being done online more efficiently. One entrepreneur who has set up a business in order to help people generate leads and win business without spending hundreds of hours sending cold messages is Frank Fourie, founder of Millionaire Education Academy.


Early Beginnings 

Fourie, 24, was born in South Africa, and growing up he had a desire to be an accountant which took him on a trip to Hong Kong for work experience which was where he had his first interactions with business. This was also a period of his life when he first came across the concept of coaching and he signed up for his first coaching session. Interested in fitness at the time having built up a reasonable social media following where people would ask him for advice he decided to set up his own training programs as an online business. It was a relatively slow start but over time Fourie started to get clients. However, something he quickly realized was that his talent was in finding and winning clients, not just developing programs for them and training them. At this point, he decided to set up a business that would teach people how to get clients for their coaching business.

Scaling Up With Artificial Intelligence 

In building out his business, the first niche he naturally decided to focus on was fitness, effectively teaching fitness entrepreneurs how to set up their online offering and generate leads. At the start, much of the work was manual with Fourie teaching them and helping them generate leads for a $1k fee. He realized that a properly structured outbound strategy through platforms such as Linkedin and Facebook could yield great results and isn’t where many companies were looking. Over time as he structured his processes and included things such as videos he was able to increase his price per client as well as transfer this knowledge outside of the fitness industry into other verticals and offer a more bespoke service for larger clients who could afford it where his team would handle all of their outreach. 
PROMOTED
Today the business employs 9 people and is very much focused on building systems utilizing technology such as artificial intelligence to automate and optimize many of the processes they have carried out and collected data on, continuously iterating so they can scale up and serve their clients efficiently. As more people become entrepreneurs and have to win their own clients, companies like Fourie’s will be an important part of the ecosystem to ensure entrepreneurs can find clients efficiently so they can focus on delivering their core skill set without having to build a large team which would be a significant expense.

With the use of broad data collection, medical professionals can provide better care for their patients and eliminate health disparities. However, as health analytics advances to improve outcomes for patients, there are also opportunities for potential health inequities.







To ensure all patients are receiving equal and quality care, analytic health technology should engage in broad data collection practices. By focusing efforts on diverse data collection, these tools can improve precision medicine, artificial intelligence, and predictive analytics to eliminate health disparities.

Data Collection for Precision Medicine
The success of precision medicine relies on large databases containing information regarding genetics, environmental factors, and lifestyle choices. Clinicians can use precision medicine to determine treatment options that work best for a patient depending on that patient’s unique personal characteristics.
Not only does precision medicine require large databases, but the databases should also contain data from diverse populations to eliminate health disparities. Racial disparities in chronic diseases are well documented in the medical field.
According to an article from Nature, “Black people in the United States are around twice as likely to die of prostate or stomach cancer as their white counterparts. Black and Hispanic people are diagnosed younger and with more aggressive types of breast cancer than white people. Across most cancer types, death rates are higher for Black people than they are for other groups.”  
To meet the needs of diverse populations and engage in precision medicine practices, databases should contain data that is representative of various groups of individuals, rather than predominantly one or two. One way to diversify data is to take part in data-sharing efforts.
By making more data available to multiple organizations, researchers can improve precision medicine practices and provide better care for all.


Improved Use of Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence capabilities have become increasingly common in the healthcare field. AI can lighten the load of physicians and provide better care for patients. To ensure the best quality care for individuals, researchers need to gather large quantities of data that equally represents diverse populations.
While collecting sizable amounts of data will better serve diverse populations, using substantial data quantities creates more work for physicians. However, AI techniques such as deep learning allow for artificial intelligence to comb through large amounts of data and analyze the information. Physicians can then use that information to evaluate conditions and guide treatment options.
Additionally, it’s important for researchers to correctly train AI algorithms to ensure the data collection process is addressing health disparities rather than creating more. To eliminate potential algorithm bias, the Center of Applied AI at Chicago Booth’s playbook outlines four steps providers should pursue.
Developers should assess the algorithm, understand the target, update or eliminate the algorithm if it is not efficient anymore, and continue to monitor and conduct audits on the algorithm.
By collecting broad data for artificial intelligence technology, providers can use techniques to help lessen health disparities.


Big Data Enhances Predictive Analytics
Predictive analytics has proven to be a useful tool among researchers and healthcare providers. By analyzing historic data and trends, medical professions can better examine the patient’s condition and determine treatment options.
Additionally, predictive analytics can play an important role in the medical decision-making process. University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center researchers are creating a blood test that can predict whether certain treatment methods for HPV-positive throat cancer are working months before standard imaging scans.
""Currently, the only way doctors know if a treatment is working is for the patient to get an imaging scan every few months to see whether their tumors are shrinking,"" oncologist Paul Swiecicki, MD said in a press release.
""And this isn't fully accurate since some cancers show what we call pseudoprogression, where a successful treatment makes the tumors bigger before it shrinks them. Our goal was to develop a test that could tell us whether a treatment is likely to work after a single cycle,"" Swiecicki said.
Using predictive analytics allows for providers to assess whether a treatment option will work by examining historic data or determine if a certain treatment method is working based on early signs of indication.
For predictive analytics to work effectively, researchers need to collect broad data from diverse sources. If a study collects data from populations that are proximately White, that data isn’t going to reflect the unique challenges that people of color face in the healthcare community.
Additionally, data collection should not only consist of demographic data but also socioeconomic and environmental factors and social determinants of health to eliminate health disparities. 
In a study using machine learning, researchers used predictive analytics to determine the likelihood of cardiovascular disease and make treatment decisions. To get a complete understanding of someone's risk factors for chronic disease, the researchers argued that providers should be looking at patients’ full health profiles, including socioeconomic and environmental factors.
By incorporating social determinants of health into predictive analytic machine learning models, providers can develop practices to better manage chronic conditions and recommend treatment options that consider a patient’s socioeconomic and environmental factors.
Through broad data collection, researchers can develop and enhance precision medicine, artificial intelligence, and predictive analytics to provide a better quality to patient care and eliminate health disparities.
