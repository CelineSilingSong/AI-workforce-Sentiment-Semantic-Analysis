Departments search for deputy director to coordinate work and design Grand Challenge for artificial intelligenceTwo central government departments are setting up a joint Office for Artificial Intelligence (AI) in an effort to make the most of the economic and service opportunities in the technology.The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DMCS) and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) have made the plan public through a job advertisement for a deputy director.It follows an emphasis on the importance of AI in the independent review of the issue, published by the two departments last October.The job advertisement, which quotes a salary of £65,000 to £80,000 on a two-year contract, says the role will bring together the leadership teams in the DCMS Tech Policy Directorate and the BEIS Business Growth Directorate.It will involve setting up the team, designing the Government’s Grand Challenge to transform AI in the UK, and developing a detailed implementation plan for commitments within the Government’s Industrial Strategy. Other responsibilities will include leading delivery of the AI Sector Deal – taking in skills, governance and security – and promoting the adoption of AI in the public and private sectors.The advertisement says the appointee will not have to be an expert in AI but will need experience in the technology sector.DCMS has indicated that the new body will complement the work of the Alan Turing Institute in the field. The AI review recommended that the institute should become the national institute for AI and data science, and work with the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, Science and Technology Facilities Council, and Joint Information Systems Committee (Jisc) to coordinate demand and computing capacity for research into the technology.This story was amended on 30 January on receipt of further information from DCMS.Image by Many Wonderful Artists, public domain through flickr

Artificial intelligence can change how recruiters do their jobs. But robots like SoftBank's Pepper... [+] aren't a threat yet. (Credit: Kiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg)





While it might seem ironic, artificial intelligence and machine learning are well on the way to lending a helping hand when it comes to solving the problems of human capital management. Recruiting is one of the toughest issues businesses face today. Finding the right talent is critical for business success, but it’s challenging to say the least, and hiring the wrong person is expensive. Recent estimates put the cost to find and hire a new employee at a quarter of a million dollars – a cost that can quickly become astronomical if that person turns out to be wrong for the role.  With the ever increasing data available about candidates and employees, some innovative AI companies are taking on the challenge of helping improve talent acquisition efficiency and effectiveness.

Recruiting efficiency: the low hanging fruit
Recruiting is a high-touch activity that involves stakeholders across the organization. AI startups are significantly reducing the operational burden by automating low level tasks and providing better information for decision makers. An example of this can be seen with X.ai  a solution that can help tackle the administrative nightmare of scheduling interviews. ClearFit saves recruiters sourcing time by automatically finding and ranking candidates and Filtered can help assess technical candidates through auto-generated coding challenges  (also improving their effectiveness). While these might not be killer apps for HR, they can deliver immediate value while helping AI companies gather data to expand into new areas.
 Recruiting effectiveness: the challenging holy grail
The big prize for enterprises comes with improved effectiveness. To tackle this, companies need better data and intelligence that allows them to find the right people for the job and focus on the right indicators when screening.
PROMOTED
With each recruiting process, there is a substantial amount of data created, but it isn’t being captured for future reference. When companies need new talent, they post a job, source candidates, screen them across different interviews and eventually pick one to fill the position. Every single time either companies or candidates go through this process, they have to start from scratch, losing not only time but also valuable information across recruiting events. Wade & Wendy is trying to address this problem with a virtual assistant that is the first point of contact with applicants that goes on to build a trail of each interaction the applicants have with the company.

When it comes to sourcing, companies still struggle to get their message through and target the right candidates at the right time. AI startups are leveraging existing data to tackle this very aspect. Textio aims to helps companies create better job postings that will help differentiate them, while Engage Talent allows them to discover passive job seekers, and target them with personalized messages at the right time.
Screening tends to rely on resumes which are both an indirect indicator of a person’s skills and an incomplete picture of their achievements and capabilities. Harver is creating a new type of screening by generating engaging tests that assess candidates on tasks they’ll have to do on the job, while Ansaro is unifying all the data companies have about their employees to build predictive models that will help them hire in smarter way.

The business model challenge
AI startups can provide significant value to both companies and applicants, but they need to understand how this value is created when they define their business model. Recruiting is a two-sided market where high value is created in very discrete time intervals (i.e. when a person is recruited). This creates a challenge for tech companies. While they are used to recurring revenue streams, their customers are likely to prefer to pay on a per job/position rather than a typical SaaS model. There are ways to overcome this, either by targeting segments that have high recruiting needs (e.g. high turnover businesses/temporary workers) or creating a product that can deliver recurring value, but startups and investors will have to consider a commission-based model in the early days and to think about how to make the transition to a recurring model if at all.
AI can make recruiting smarter
While companies have increasing amounts and diversity of data they can leverage to try to identify the best fit for each position, the recruiting process is still stuck in the past, based on standardized resumes and (potentially biased) interviewers’ opinions, and companies are suffering because of that. Even though we are talking about people, machines seem to be able to help not only source but also screen applicants. In fact, studies have shown that humans are notoriously bad at picking the right applicant and a meta-analysis illustrated that algorithms can outperform human experts in hiring.
Even though AI is far from being able to autonomously decide who a company should hire when it comes to figuring out who the best person is for the job, you might want to check out how AI is make recruiting smarter.Valley VoicesFollowingFollowEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions

Americans Upbeat on Artificial Intelligence, but Still Wary
by RJ Reinhart







Story Highlights

76% of Americans say AI will change the way people work and live
77% of these U.S. adults say those changes will be positive
However, 73% say AI adoption will result in net job loss


WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Three in four Americans (76%) agree or strongly agree that artificial intelligence (AI) will fundamentally change the way people work and live over the next decade. Among those who expect this transformation, a similar 77% believe these changes will be ""mostly"" or ""very positive.""


Attitudes on the Impact of the Adoption of Artificial Intelligence
Overall, do you believe artificial intelligence will have a mostly positive, mostly negative, or neither positive nor negative impact on how people work and live in the next 10 years? (among Americans who say AI will fundamentally change people's lives and work in the next 10 years)

Northeastern University/Gallup survey, Sept. 15-Oct. 10, 2017





These data come from a new Northeastern University/Gallup survey of Americans' attitudes toward AI and its effect on their lives and work. The mail survey of 3,297 U.S. adults took place Sept. 15-Oct. 10, 2017. In the survey, AI is defined as computers, robots or other technology that can accomplish tasks humans can do, as well as learn and accomplish tasks that humans may not be able to do.
Similar proportions of white-collar workers (those working in largely salaried industries) and blue-collar workers (those working in industries largely composed of hourly wage earners) strongly agree or agree that AI will fundamentally alter the way people work and live -- 80% vs. 77%, respectively. However, white-collar workers who expect it to have an impact are more optimistic than blue-collar workers are about how it will affect people's lives, with 78% saying those changes will be very or mostly positive, compared with 68% of blue-collar workers who expect AI to have this level of impact.
In line with occupational differences, Americans' optimism about the effect of AI also differs according to their level of education. Among those who expect AI to have a fundamental impact, 82% with a bachelor's degree or higher, vs. 74% of those without a bachelor's degree, say the impact of AI will be very or mostly positive.

Americans Anticipate Negative Effects From AI Adoption
While the public largely believes the impact of AI will be positive, it also anticipates that the technology will have some significant downsides. Chief among these is job loss, with 73% of Americans saying the adoption of AI will result in a loss of more jobs than it creates. White-collar workers (71%) are less likely than blue-collar workers (82%) to say AI adoption will result in a net job loss.

In addition to expecting job losses, a majority (63%) of Americans believe the adoption of AI will widen the gap between the rich and the poor. Among white-collar workers and Americans with a bachelor's degree or higher, two in three (66%) of both groups say AI will widen the gap.

Northeastern University/Gallup survey, Sept. 15-Oct. 10, 2017




Americans' views on AI may be at least partly related to a lack of familiarity with the technology, with slightly more than half (55%) saying they have an ""excellent"" or ""good"" understanding of what AI is, but 45% saying their understanding is ""only fair"" or ""poor.""
Implications
The media have reported extensively about the potential for AI to eliminate large numbers of jobs across the U.S. economy, and Americans agree, with more than seven in 10 saying AI will eliminate more jobs than it creates. While Americans agree that AI adoption will result in a net loss of jobs, they remain largely positive about the impact the new technology will have on their lives and work over the next decade.
Developing and implementing policies that pre-emptively tackle or respond to the negative effects of AI adoption will prove a key challenge for government, industry and education. Encouraging Americans to prepare to succeed in this rapidly changing economy by obtaining the additional education necessary to work with AI will also prove a major task. However, not doing so would only exacerbate the disruption of people's lives and work that the adoption of AI is already likely to create.

Survey Methods
Results for the Northeastern University/Gallup survey on artificial intelligence are based on surveys conducted by mail from Sept. 15-Oct. 10, 2017, with a random sample of 3,297 U.S. adults aged 18 and older. The survey package included an English and a Spanish survey to provide respondents with the flexibility to reply in their preferred language.
Gallup selected the sample of U.S. residents using address-based sampling (ABS), a sampling technique used to select households from a list of all households on file with the United States Postal Service (USPS). Gallup chooses respondents within the household at random based on which household member would have the next birthday. Gallup used a series of postcard reminders to encourage participation in the survey.
Gallup weighted the data to match national demographics of gender, age, education, race, Hispanic ethnicity, education and region.
All reported margins of sampling error include computed design effects for weighting.

In 2013, he co-authored a paper that found that people’s Facebook “likes” could be used to predict personal characteristics like personality traits (a finding that reportedly inspired the conservative data firm Cambridge Analytica).For the new paper, Kosinski built a program with his co-author Yilun Wang using a common artificial intelligence program to scan more than 30,000 photos uploaded to an unnamed dating site. The software’s job? To figure out a pattern about what could distinguish a gay person’s face from a straight person’s.When choosing between a pair of photos, the resulting program accurately identified a gay man 81 percent of the time and a gay woman 71 percent of the time. The researchers also asked humans to do the same task — and they fared worse, guessing correctly 54 to 61 percent of the time.More controversially, Kosinski and Wang’s paper claimed that the program based its decision on differences in facial structure; that gay men’s faces were more feminine and lesbian women’s faces were more masculine. They suggested this finding was in line with the prenatal hormone theory of sexual orientation, which suggests our sexuality is, in part, determined by hormone exposure in the womb. This conclusion is hotly contested by some of their colleagues, who say the research is confounded by the fact that the photos were uploaded by the users themselves and not taken in a neutral lab setting. (Read a thorough critique of those conclusions here). But even if the algorithm is just picking up on personal choices, the result feels unsettling, like the first stone on a path to a Black Mirror future.LGBTQ rights groups decried the research, saying it’s based in pseudoscience and poses a danger to members of the LGBTQ community around the world. Other researchers in psychology decried it as physiognomy, the long-defunct pseudoscience of attributing personality traits to physical characteristics. The paper is expected to run in a February edition of Personality and Social Psychology. Kosinski insists his intent was never to out anyone, but rather to warn us about the rapid extinction of privacy.And sexual orientation, he argues, is a start. Many more aspects of our inner lives — like personality traits — may be encoded in our faces. This is also a controversial idea, which harks back to the pseudoscience of physiognomy.When I spoke to Kosinski in November at his Stanford office, I was most interested in learning why he’s asking these controversial research questions, and whether his “warning” of a loss a privacy is actually just a blueprint to achieve it. He argues these technologies are already being used and have a huge potential for misuse.Industries, governments, and even psychologists can mine the digital footprints we leave everywhere and learn things about ourselves we wouldn’t necessarily be willing to share. “Basically, going forward, there’s going to be no privacy whatsoever,” he says.This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.Kosinski wants to study human behavior via digital footprintsAlfred Pasieka/Science Photo LibraryBrian ResnickYou’ve become pretty famous in the past few years. I was first familiar with your work on deriving personality profiles from Facebook. [This is the work that would inspire Cambridge Analytica.]But that’s a whole other story than the “gaydar” machine.Michal KosinskiIt’s exactly the same story.Brian ResnickReally. How so?Michal KosinskiMy overarching goal is to try to understand people, social processes, and behavior better through the lens of digital footprints.It proves pretty difficult to study human behavior and psychology using big data. But there’s huge promise there. What’s interesting are the tiny details that we may actually notice in big data, and the effect might be tiny.You can very easily create a “black box” that would take some of this digital footprint data and produce very accurate predictions of future behavior and psychological traits. By studying what’s inside this black box, we may understand behavior better. Even without studying the black box, we already know that the computer, in its own computer’s way, understood the links.Brian ResnickBy “black box,” you mean artificial intelligence and neural networks. That’s where computers are trained to make predictions off data, but you, the researcher, don’t know how it’s making the prediction. That prediction might be interesting, but it doesn’t always help you hypothesize about what’s really going on.Michal KosinskiExactly.It proves to be uncomfortably accurate at making predictions.We know that companies are already collecting this data and using such black boxes to predict future behavior. Google, Facebook, and Netflix are doing this.Basically, most of the modern platforms are just virtually based on recording digital footprints and predicting future behavior.Why computers may be better at reading faces than humansGetty Creative ImagesBrian ResnickSo for this project, the digital footprint you studied was profile pictures: 35,000-plus photos obtained from a dating website. Why did you want to study faces?Michal KosinskiA few reasons.First of all, maybe only five years ago, computer technology reached the stage at which you can run [these] analyses on your computer or laptop, as opposed to needing a supercomputer.Before, we just couldn’t really do it. We could study faces, but we would have to use very inaccurate measures. We had people judging the faces.Brian ResnickOkay. But why did you think the computer could correlate facial attributes with personal characteristics?Michal KosinskiPeople can predict intimate traits of others from the faces. Gender is an example. Emotion, age, Down syndrome, developmental disease. There’s a huge range of things we can detect from people’s faces.Someone told me in the response to my recent paper that “extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.” What strikes me is it’s extraordinary to claim there is no sign of sexual orientation on your face, because so many other things — gender, age, and so on — leave signs on human faces.Psychologists would say, “Oh, yes, that’s true, but not personality. This is just pseudoscience.” I’m like, wait. You can accept that you can predict 57 things, but if I say, “What about 58?” you say, “This is absolutely theoretically impossible. This is pseudoscience. How can you even say that?”Brian ResnickPeople aren’t great at intuiting sexual orientation from just looking at a person’s face. Why would a neural network do better?Michal KosinskiWherever we try to apply neural nets to do something that humans were doing before, with very little tinkering you can get results that are better than what humans can do. This is amazing — in many cases, like self-driving cars, they are already safer than humans. Planes land themselves. We have all of those AI-based tools around us that make our lives better.We have many years of evidence that humans judge personality, intelligence, and political views from people faces with little accuracy.Why? Maybe because people cannot perceive [these things]. [For instance,] we focus on the wrinkles around your eyes because this is useful in judging emotion. But we don’t focus on wrinkles elsewhere. [Meaning there may be some clues to a person’s sexuality or personality in the face that we just don’t pay attention to.]The second is that maybe people, even if they perceive, they cannot interpret. [That is, we see the signs on a person’s face that relate to personality or sexual orientation, but we don’t connect the dots.] Our neural networks might be trained better to judge.“Can you please check how threatening this bomb is?”Adapted from Getty ImagesBrian ResnickOf all of the personal traits or characteristics to study, why did you choose sexual orientation for this paper? It was sure to be controversial.Michal KosinskiBecause it’s most urgent. I already ran studies on political views, personality, IQ, and a bunch of other things. Those other things, they’re interesting. They’re potentially important. But when it comes to sexual orientation, it’s super urgent.If you asked me, “Hey, Michal, why don’t you become a scientist to build explosives to build a new bigger bomb?” I would be like, “I don’t think people should be doing that.”Now, if you asked me, “We already have this bomb. We have these algorithms. Can you please check how threatening this bomb is?” Which is essentially what I tried to do. I think this is a really important aspect because we already have the danger. We have the risk, and we try to find ways to neutralize it.A smart person with a computer and access to the internet can judge sexual orientation of anyone in the world, or millions of people simultaneously with very little effort, which makes lives of homophobes and oppressive regimes just a tiny bit more easy.Brian ResnickYou say that this research is, in part, a warning about our loss of privacy. But then, aren’t you giving the world a blueprint to invade people’s privacy?[Note: I should mention, the “gaydar” machine Kosinski created isn’t all that practical to use in the real world. The algorithm was tested by analyzing pairs of photos, one of a straight person and one of a gay person. The computer had to make a guess about who was gay. It chose correctly 81 percent of the time. This is not the same task as picking seven gay men out of a lineup of 100.]Michal KosinskiI’m taking an existing weapon [AI and facial recognition], and I’m saying it’s already being used.Brian ResnickWho is using it?Michal KosinskiGovernments are already doing this in practice.[Note: There’s one startup called Faception that claims it can detect terrorists or pedophiles just by looking at faces, and says it has contracts with governments. It has been reported that Kosinski was an adviser to Faception. He says this is a mischaracterization, and that he has accepted no money from them. He says, “I’m happy to give advice,” and, “Look, if you study how chemicals are dangerous, you should be advising companies producing chemicals.”]Many fear AI will just be used to discriminate under the guise of objectivityGetty ImagesBrian ResnickThere’s a fear with AI that these networks are really just learning stereotypes.With the photos of people’s sexual orientation, in your paper you noted these are people’s self-selected photos. You didn’t take 30,000 people and bring them into a lab and take perfectly neutral photos of them. So your program could be picking up on things other than face shape, like makeup or grooming. That it’s not picking up on something biological, as your paper claims, but it’s picking up on choices.Michal KosinskiThe whole point of this paper is that you don’t need to bring people to the lab. You can just take their pictures from Facebook or from a dating website, and the prediction is possible.The whole idea of machine learning is that you can train it on the original sample, and then as the machine works, it will just start matching patterns and noticing patterns and enriching the model.I expect that if you take the model trained on dating websites and apply it to a DMV database of driving license photos, at the beginning, first few thousand, the model will probably struggle. Like learn there is a new pattern of lighting or what not, but this is the idea of machine learning and neural networks. It automatically will adjust. Even without any additional training data, it will improve the accuracy. It learns about the patterns in new images.Brian ResnickThere was a paper that came out of China where researchers used facial recognition to look at drivers’ license photos and predict who is a criminal. It purported to have an accuracy of 89.5 percent. I’ve talked to some experts about this, and the biggest concern there was this: What was this program picking up on? Could it be physical features of certain ethnic groups that are discriminated against in the justice system?Michal KosinskiYou can, but stereotypes also might be accurate. It might be that gay people ... I don’t know, talk differently. But it may also be true that to some extent, they talk differently. But humans have a problem with judging probability.The beauty of a computer is it can go beyond the stereotype. Use the stereotype proper. Like, the stereotype developed by a computer will be an accurate one. It’s a data-driven thing.The point is even if the prediction is not very accurate, you can sort people from most likely to least likely and just focus your efforts at the top. When it comes to, say, finding criminals, like people that want to blow themselves up or kill your grandma, I think there are still problems with using such technology to detect such people, but I’m open to discussing it.There will be biases. Nothing is perfect in AI.Adapted from Getty ImagesBrian ResnickLet’s say you did a machine learning project using police mug shots in the United States.Wouldn’t a machine learning program learn there’s racial prejudice in our justice system? But it wouldn’t know it’s racial prejudice — it would just begin to associate darker complexions with criminality. And then if you used that machine to predict who is a criminal, all you’d be doing is reinforcing a stereotype.Michal KosinskiIf you trained the model in a stupid way, then of course. You can make an algorithm as racist as no human being has ever been in the history. You can make a stupid thing, no question about it.We can train algorithms in such a way as to not be racists, minimize those biases, and, as opposed to humans, we can control for these biases. We can examine how algorithms work.Also, we have to compare in the algorithms with what we already have.People say, “Oh, if you use algorithmic hiring, sentencing, or whatnot, there will be biases.” I agree.There will be biases. Nothing is perfect in AI. It’s not perfect, but you always have to compare it with the status quo.What is the alternative? The alternative is using humans. Humans are racist, sexist, ageist, corrupt, unfair, get tired, and we know that. We understand this very well.People think morality is outside the realm of science. Integrity is outside of the realm of science. This, of course, is silly.Brian ResnickCan you understand why people were afraid of this?Michal KosinskiI understand the gut feeling. I’m not writing this paper with pleasure. It freaks me out that it’s possible. I would love for those results to fail to replicate. It would just mean that we have one problem less as humanity, but give me a chance to sit down and talk you through with someone and actually show them the paper. Have them read the paper and the hate goes away.I had a number of those experiences, including with people who sent me death threats.Brian ResnickWhat’s the big story here? The takeaway.Michal KosinskiThe big story is that we’re not going to have any privacy very soon. I’m all for privacy-protecting laws and technologies, but people keep forgetting that they’re just doomed to fail. Equifax had amazing data protecting technologies. If big companies and governments cannot protect their data, how can you believe that you or our readers or I would be able to protect our data? The motivated party is out there to get them. They will get the data, however much they encrypt it.Also, even if we somehow magically get full control of our data, we still want to share the data. We want to tweet. We want to write stuff on Facebook. We want to walk the streets without covering my face and distorting my voice. This is already enough to make very accurate predictions of my sensitive traits [like personality, politics, wealth]. Basically, going forward, there’s going to be no privacy whatsoever.Brian ResnickThere’s nothing we can do.Michal KosinskiThere’s little we can do.Now we have to sit down, and the sooner we sit down and start thinking about how to make sure that the post-privacy world — or post-privacy world for some people, like for poor, underprivileged people living in non-liberal, non-Western countries, if their world suddenly becomes a post-privacy world — how do we make sure that it’s still safe and habitable place to live?You’ve read 1 article in the last monthHere at Vox, we believe in helping everyone understand our complicated world, so that we can all help to shape it.

How to brace yourself for the future of work


The disruptive future you've been hearing about is already here and in every sector.

Last summer I wrote about Forum for the Future’s report ""Future of Health and Wellbeing in the Workplace."" The topic of the Future of Work is getting a lot of coverage. My interest lies in how the Future of Work applies to sustainability. In March, UC Berkeley Haas School of Business’ Center for Responsible Business will hold a ""Future of Work"" conference lead by Faris Natour, principal and co-founder of Article One Advisors and leader of the Center’s Human Rights and Business Initiative. I spoke with him about how sustainability practitioners can create strategies and partnerships that minimize the risks and maximize the positive impacts of these changes.The media portrayal of the Future of Work tends to be polarizing, with some people describing doomsday scenarios where robots take all jobs, and others painting a picture of technologies that make people’s jobs safer, more efficient and more engaging.""Too often, the debate about the future of work and artificial intelligence and automation is fought at the very extremes of the spectrum, when in reality new technologies will bring both risks and opportunities,"" said Natour.What the future of work means for sustainability and human rightsNatour points to two trends that are redefining the future of work and have implications for sustainability and human rights: new technologies such as automation and artificial intelligence (AI); and the rise of the platform economy.
More collaboration between CSR and sustainability, human rights and human resources teams will be essential.

According to a 2017 PwC report, a large percentage of jobs could become automated, including an estimated 38 percent in the United States, 35 percent in Germany, 30 percent in the United Kingdom and 21 percent in Japan. According to a McKinsey Global Institute analysis, by 2030, between 400 million and 800 million people will need to find new jobs because of automation. The same McKinsey study noted that it’s likely enough new jobs will be created to offset the lost jobs.Natour said sustainability and human rights risks include the potential for widespread elimination of jobs due to AI or automation, and privacy issues related to the collection of employee data. Natour also pointed to benefits, including the automation of risky jobs in industries such as extractives, the reduction of waste from more efficient processes, the elimination of dull or repetitive tasks and the ability for people to work more efficiently and flexibly through new technologies.






The platform economy, which Natour describes as ""the shift from a long-term, single employer work life to a portfolio of different jobs and gigs,"" is also changing the nature of work. A 2016 McKinsey study found that between 20 and 30 percent of working-age people in Europe and the United States had engaged in some kind of independent work. The Aspen Institute reports that between 2002 and 2014, the growth of the gig economy in the U.S. outpaced the growth of total employment by between 2 and 8 percentage points.Natour said this trend is supporting sustainability efforts such as employee well-being by encouraging employers to create more flexible work environments. Yet it is also creating potential risks, such as lack of job security, benefits and fair pay, and lack of protection against issues that intersect with human rights, such as discrimination and harassment.How employers should prepare for the future of workNatour recommends employers begin preparing for these changes by taking stock of the risks and opportunities throughout their operations.Because these issues can cut across functions, he recommends the internal assessment engage a diverse set of teams, including sustainability, HR supply chain, legal, ethics and public affairs. This will help the company determine the biggest impacts, and identify which departments should take the lead on the preparations such as retraining the workforce, addressing questions about automation in the supply chain, updating policies to protect independent contractors or looking at ethical questions such as who is responsible for an accident caused by an autonomous vehicle or privacy issues due to a data breach.
This transition is happening now and it’s affecting all sectors.

Next, Natour advises forming a cross-functional task force to create processes and policies that maximize the impacts and mitigate the risks. He said sustainability practitioners are critical on these teams because they have experience working across functions and because many of these trends relate to core sustainability issues such as community and social impacts.""More collaboration between CSR and sustainability, human rights and human resources teams will be essential to addressing these issues effectively,"" he said. (Another Article One partner, Chloe Poynton, recently wrote a blog outlining the opportunity for corporate human rights and human resources teams to deepen their collaboration.)The final step is to look externally: Join an industry collaboration, or reach out to government, civil society or academic institutions that are exploring trends and strategies on the issues your company has identified. Natour noted a few organizations, such as the Aspen Institute’s Future of Work initiative, the International Corporate Accountability Roundtable’s (ICAR) Robots and Rights initiative, and the Partnership on AI.Natour emphasized that this transition is happening now, affecting all sectors.""If you’re not currently looking at these issues and trying to understand how your company is exposed, it’s important to do that right away because we’re in the middle of the disruption, not on the verge of it,"" he said.To learn more, the ""Future of Work"" conference will be March 21 at the UC Berkeley Haas School of Business’ Center for Responsible Business.

Moreover, voice recognition is becoming so advanced that standing clients and potential customers will no longer have to talk to humans about their financial needs. Even if a person is going to make the final decision about a transaction, most of the work has already been done.This development, however, may also hasten the end of banks. Due to Japan's zero interest rate policy, domestic banks can't make money on loans, so they've become clearinghouses for other financial companies' products, be it mutual funds or insurance policies. Banks are basically salesmen who collect handling fees for delivering products and services. Once that task is automated or otherwise rendered obsolete by new technology, what's the point of a bank?These types of stories have been receiving a great deal of attention in the media for a while now, and Asahi's affiliate weekly magazine, Aera, devoted a large portion of its Jan. 22 issue specifically to the end of banking in Japan. The articles seem to be a response to announcements made in recent months by the three Japanese “megabanks” that they would be eliminating a large number of jobs over the next decade: 19,000 at Mizuho Financial Group, 9,500 at Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and 4,000 at Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group.","{'@type': 'Organization', 'name': 'The Japan Times', 'url': 'https://www.japantimes.co.jp/'}",,,

Much like cloning, people are entertaining serious speculations in the acceptance of artificial intelligence. Many are of the opinion that such technology will eventually result in the elimination of the human race or in its suppression, just as seen in certain Sci-Fi movies.
Others believe that the technology will be a considerable threat to jobs. Without jobs, there will be unrest, which would still, eventually, lead to the breakdown of the human race.
But really, how accurate are these allegations or beliefs? Do we stand to lose more than what we are gaining from artificial intelligence? To properly investigate these claims, we need to fully understand the concept of artificial intelligence and weigh its pros and cons for a mobile app development company.
The concept of artificial intelligence describes computer systems performing jobs and task that would typically require a human to complete. Some of these functions include; speech recognition and translation, visual perception, decision making.
There are different levels or classifications of artificial intelligence in mobile app development company. AI can be classified into strong and weak. Strong artificial intelligence describes programming that could imitate a human, in thought and actions. While weak intelligence only mimics humans in actions. There is also narrow and general artificial intelligence, this classification is based on the extent of the capability of the programming.
Pros and cons of artificial intelligence for mobile app development:
Pros
Complete Tedious Task:
One of the significant advantages of artificially intelligent machines for mobile app development company is their ability to perform and complete tedious tasks that would have otherwise been too boring for humans. Using intricate and careful automation, these artificial intelligent machines can work for very long periods without a decrease in its production capacity. The elimination of mundane tasks from human workload frees up time to handle more important matters.
Less error:
Artificial intelligence machines are especially important in fields that require a very high degree of accuracy and precision. One of such area is space exploration. In space exploration, there are no margins for error and any wrongly placed number could ruin the entire process. Hence the need for artificial intelligence machines to help with the crunching of very complex numbers.
Also, artificially intelligent robots are programmed to help with space exploration. These robots are built to withstand the harsh atmosphere of space. They are acclimatised such that they cannot be broken down, modified or disfigured by the hostile space atmosphere.
Difficult exploration:
There are places on our planets that are difficult, if not wholly impossible, for humans to explore. The ocean floor is one of such locations. The extreme pressure in the ocean floor is too high for humans and would crush anyone in seconds. Intelligent robots, on the other hand, can be built with a unique material such as to withstand the pressure of the ocean floor.
Intelligent robots can also be used for fuel exploration and other mining processes. These robots are built such that they can perform challenging jobs without tiring quickly.
Daily application:
Artificial intelligence has found use in our daily lives. In travel and tourism, artificial intelligent apps can be used to detect locations much easily using augmented reality. Augmented reality superimposes computer-generated images on the real world view of the user, improving his/her perception of the surrounding. This is also used in museums, allowing for more robust customer experience.
Artificial intelligence can also be used for predictive writing and correction of human spelling. In the posting on photographs on social media, artificial intelligence programming can help to identify and detect a person’s face and correctly tag the individual.
Medicine:
Artificial intelligence has tremendous importance in medicine. Intelligent robots can be used in the diagnostic and treatment of diseases. They can also help inform doctors on the side effects of certain drugs. Also, they can be helpful in artificial surgery simulators.
Cons:
Cost:
One of the major drawbacks of artificially intelligent machines for mobile app development company is cost. They are very costly to build and even more costly to maintain and manage. There is always the need for upgrades so they can match the changing needs and environment. This usually requires more research. In the case of breakdowns, these machines can require a lot of processes for recovery of lost codes and reinstall the system.
Job losses:
This is one of the leading argument against artificial intelligence, and it is one that has since begun to happen. Many low-skilled jobs have been lost due to replacement by intelligent machines. A good example is in the assembly line in mobile app development company. A typical assembly line which would have given jobs to 30-50 people can be automated such that only 5 people will be needed for monitoring and supervision.
But this could be taken to a whole new level through the introduction of latest technology such as driverless cars. This could lead to loss of several jobs like taxi drivers and chauffeurs.
Lack of judgment calls:
No matter how smart an artificial intelligence robot is, it would still lack the judgment calls associated with humans. There are times when human judgment and calls are necessary and not something decided based on algorithms and calculations. A good example is the Sydney Australia shooting that took place in 2014.
When people started calling Uber to escape from the affected area, rather than make a decision to help those in need, the algorithm made its decision on the economies of supply and demand and hiked the price of its rides.
Lack of original creativity:
When it comes to innovative creativity and imagination for mobile app development company, you can only find it in humans. Artificial intelligent machines will help to design and create but have no capacity for the original creative ability that is found in humans. These devices lack the sensitivity and feeling that is found in humans.
No improvement in experience:
In humans, learning comes as a factor of experience. But this is not so with artificial intelligent machines in mobile app development company. Of course, they can store a lot of information, but they are unable to access this information the same way humans does.
They cannot alter their reactions and responses according to a changing environment. They cannot make a distinction between someone who is hardworking and someone who is inefficient. They lack the human touch necessary for effective living.

At a mere 23 years old, Japan's latest news anchor would make her parents proud — if she had any.Erica, a lifelike android designed to look like a 23-year-old woman, may soon become a TV news anchor in Japan, the Wall Street Journal reported. According to Hiroshi Ishiguro, director of the Intelligent Robotics Laboratory at Osaka Universityand Erica's creator, the android will replace a human news anchor on the airwaves as soon as April, the Daily Mail said.Erica the android may be well suited for this desk job. For starters, she can capably recite scripted writing and sit in a chair, making her about as qualified for television as most humans. (According to Ishiguro, the android was originally designed to be a receptionist.)

Erica is capable of holding a conversation with humans, thanks to a combination of speech-generation algorithms, facial-recognition technology and infrared sensors that allow her to track faces across a room, the Daily Mail reported. While she cannot move her arms yet, Erica can move her facial features, neck, shoulders and waist independently, Ishiguro Laboratories said, allowing her to respond to human speech with uncanny autonomy.LATEST VIDEOS FROM livescienceLive ScienceAccording to the Daily Mail, Erica has been described by her creator as being so lifelike that she could ""have a soul.""Others might call her uncanny. But Erica will hardly be the first eerily lifelike robot to hold a mass human audience. In October 2017, a robot named Sophia was granted citizenship to Saudi Arabia after impressing journalists with her answers to simple interview questions at a tech conference in Riyadh.When asked about the uncanny valley — a psychological effect that activates when an artificial human entity looks both eerily familiar and foreign at the same time — Sophia was less than sympathetic.Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter nowGet the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.""Am I really that creepy?"" Sophia asked the audience. ""Well, even if I am, get over it.""Whether Erica brings more tact to the stage than her Saudi Arabian colleague remains to be seen.Originally published on Live Science.

The project will be run with the support and participation of different governmental, semi-governmental, and private institutions.Major General Ibrahim Khalil Al Mansouri, Assistant Commander for Criminal Investigations of Dubai Police, announcing the project at a press conference said that aim of Oyoon is to created an integrated security system that works through all strategic partners to exploit modern and sophisticated technologies and artificial intelligence features to prevent crime, reduce traffic accident related deaths, prevent any negative incidents in residential, commercial and vital areas and to be able to respond immediately to incidents even before they get reported to the command unit.He also added that the project will also contribute to help police with the decision-making process and optimizing human resources by reducing their intervention in areas of monitoring, analysis and surveillance.“The project is an effective translation of the UAE’s strategy for artificial intelligence to achieve its objectives of relying on services, data analysis and smart application in various fields of work efficiently and effectively. In addition to integrating the first line services of the Dubai Police provided to the public through artificial intelligence in the main police operations,” he continued.Arabian Business citing some police sources reported that the project will feature a facial-recognition software that can identify the suspects, microphone-enabled cameras that can ‘speak’ to suspects in public and license plate readers.UAE had last year appointed a 27 year old as its Artificial Intelligence Minister becoming the first country to do so and a Dubai-based startup Derq that uses artificial intelligence to reduce road-accidents has been running a pilot in some areas of the city.
