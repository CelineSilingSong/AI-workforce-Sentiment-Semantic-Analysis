The technology has touched nearly every aspect of business and society, from transforming hiring to making marketing more effective to increasing crop yields. But most importantly of all, AI is hard at work saving lives. Here are some of the amazing ways that AI is becoming the superhero of the tech world. 
AI is hard at work saving lives. getty

1. Preventing Accidents
Each year, 1.35 million people die from vehicle-related accidents, and more than half of these victims are “vulnerable road users” (e.g., pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcyclists).

As autonomous vehicles become an increasing presence on roadways, there is growing concern about how everyone will share the road safely. A new app, !important, aims to minimize the risks of accidents with all certified connected vehicles: cars and trucks, buses, autonomous vehicles, construction equipment—even drones.

PROMOTED
The AI-enabled app creates a virtual protection zone around pedestrians, wheelchair users, cyclists or motorcyclists using their mobile devices. 

The app sends the user’s location coordinates to all nearby automated or connected vehicles, augmenting the vehicles’ sensor input to ensure the individual is recognized and tracked. If a connected vehicle gets too close to an !important user, its brakes will be triggered automatically before a collision can occur.

2. Improving Healthcare Delivery
Healthcare is one of the most important areas where AI is playing a critical role in saving lives. Despite the extensive training physicians and nurses receive, they cannot identify every ailment or medical condition. Furthermore, Covid-19 has certainly shown the challenges that remain in helping large numbers of critically ill patients. Companies are searching for—and finding—solutions thanks to machine learning and AI.
Health Catalyst has developed catalyst.ai, healthcare.ai and its healthcare analytics platform as potentially life-saving technologies for a wide range of clinical scenarios. For example, its machine-learning capability can identify those patients at greatest risk of readmission and provide clinicians with guidance that enables them to step in and address the problem. The technology has also helped to prevent hospital-acquired infections, predict chronic disease and reduce mortality rates.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, many frontline workers around the world have tragically lost their lives to the virus while assisting patients. Bracing for a second wave, the Sheba Medical Center in Israel is testing smart hospital rooms that could save patients’ lives as well as those of doctors and nurses. The Israeli hospital believes that AI-powered robots, virtual reality glasses and early warning systems can all provide better outcomes for Covid-19 patients and a safer environment for those who care for them.

3. Detecting Medical Conditions
AI can also save lives outside the hospital setting. Corti understands that many medical emergencies occur before or during ambulance dispatch when there are only minutes to save a life. This inspired the company to create an AI-enabled system that can identify cardiac arrest.
The voice-based digital assistant listens in on emergency calls and analyzes what patients say to determine their current medical state. Trials of the system in Copenhagen found that it decreased cases of undetected out-of-hospital cardiac arrest by 43%. The company is already working on ways its solution can be used to diagnose other ailments and provide further life-saving assistance. 
4. Improving Pharmaceutical Solutions
Although drugs address medical conditions and save lives, many have side effects that can lead to other health risks. Okwin is one company that has taken on the challenge of improving pharmaceutical solutions through AI-powered medical research and development. 
It uses a machine-learning algorithm to create models designed to predict disease evolution, improve treatment and then enhance the way drugs are developed for these diseases. Okwin leverages an extensive amount of data from its hospital partners to find ways to help patients improve more quickly while minimizing side effects. 
5. Ending Human Trafficking
Not all threats to life are healthcare-related. The global issue of human trafficking is another pandemic that requires greater attention. Those who are fighting this global scourge have found that AI can come to the rescue of millions of women and children who are being trafficked.
Investigating human trafficking can take countless hours and resources to cull through online data. However, AI can step in, collect and process the data and identify patterns at a rate that humans are incapable of achieving. AI can also be used in image recognition software to track both the criminals and locate the victims. The result is an ability to catch traffickers in the act and uncover their global networks.
Delta 8.7 is an organization that applies AI and computational science to track and stop human traffickers. The organization is partnering with the United Nations University Centre for Policy Research, the Alan Turing Institute, the Computing Community Consortium, Tech Against Trafficking and others to find further ways to use technology to address this critical social issue. 
Changing the World for the Better
Human life is invaluable and must be protected. From preventing life-threatening traffic accidents to saving the victims of human trafficking, AI is giving human beings a greater chance at safe and happy lives.

NSF advances artificial intelligence research with new nationwide institutes



August 26, 2020





The U.S. National Science Foundation is establishing new artificial intelligence institutes to accelerate research, expand America's workforce, and transform society in the decades to come. Enabled by sustained federal investment and channeled toward issues of national importance, continued advancement in AI research holds the potential for further economic impact and improvements in quality of life.With an investment of over $100 million over the next five years, NSF's Artificial Intelligence Institutes represent the nation's most significant federal investment in AI research and workforce development to date. The $20 million investment in each of five NSF AI institutes is just the beginning, with more institute announcements anticipated in the coming years.




A new AI agent developed by researchers at the University of Texas at Austin takes a few ""glimpses"" of its surroundings, representing less than 20 percent of the full 360 degree view, and infers the rest of the whole environment. What makes this system so effective is that it's not just taking pictures in random directions but, after each glimpse, choosing the next shot that it predicts will add the most new information about the whole scene.

DoD Using Artificial Intelligence to Detect Cancer in Medical Images


The project aims to use the best of artificial intelligence technology to identify cancers and other medical issues.

The Department of Defense’s (DoD) Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) is leveraging artificial intelligence tools and the department’s vast amount of medical data to identify cancers and other conditions.







The project, called Predictive Health, will aim to develop new tools that medical professionals can use to more accurately and quickly identify medical issues in patients.
Scientists will train AI algorithms to look at de-identified DoD medical images to teach it to identify cancers. The AI can then be used with augmented reality microscopes to help medical professionals better identify cancer cells.
Using these tools, providers will be able to catch diseases earlier and reduce costly healthcare procedures.
""From a big-picture perspective, this is about integrating AI into the DOD healthcare system,"" said Nathanael Higgins, the support contractor managing the program for DIU. ""There are four critical areas we think this technology can impact. The first one is, it's going to help drive down cost.""
The project will also develop tools to help healthcare professionals make more informed decisions.
""Medical professionals are already overworked,"" said Higgins. ""We're essentially giving them an additional tool that will help them make confident decisions — and know that they made the right decision — so that we're not facing as many false negatives or false positives. And ultimately we're able to identify these types of disease states earlier, and that'll help the long-term prognosis.""
To train these AI algorithms, the Predictive Health project will use DoD data from CT scans, MRIs, x-rays, and slide imagery made from biopsies. Because the department has access to a diverse set of data, the algorithms will be trained on information representative of all patient populations.
""If you think about it, the DOD, through retired and active duty service, is probably one of the largest health care systems in the world, at about 9 million people,"" said Dr. Niels Olson, the DIU chief medical officer and originator of the Predictive Health project.
""The more data a tool has available to it, the more effective it is. That's kind of what makes DOD unique. We have a larger pool of information to draw from, so that you can select more diverse cases. Unlike some of the other large systems, we have a pretty good representation of the US population. The military actually has a nice smooth distribution of population in a lot of ways that other regional systems don't have. And we have it at scale.""
Privacy will also be top of mind during the project, DoD officials noted.
""We'll use de-identified information, imaging, from clinical specimens,"" Olson said. ""So this means actual CT images and actual MRI images of people who have a disease, where you remove all of the identifiers and then just use the diagnostic imaging and the actual diagnosis that the pathologist or radiologist wrote down.""
Leaders stated that although the AI will eventually serve as a companion tool for providers, it won’t replace human experts entirely.
""The prototype of this technology that we're adopting will not replace the practitioner. It is an enabler — it is not a cure-all. It is designed to enhance our people and their decision making. If there's one thing that's true about DOD, it's that people are our most important resource. We want to give them the best tools to succeed at their job,” said Higgins.
""AI is obviously the pinnacle of that type of tool in terms of what it can do and how it can help people make decisions. The intent here is to arm them with an additional tool so that they make confident decisions 100 percent of the time.""
In addition to DIU, the Predictive Health project will involve the Defense Health Agency, three private-sector businesses, and the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC). JAIC will provide funding and added technical expertise for the broader initiative.
""The JAIC's contributions to this initiative have engendered the strategic development of required infrastructure to enable AI-augmented radiographic and pathologic diagnostic capabilities,"" said Navy Capt. (Dr.) Hassan Tetteh, the JAIC's Warfighter Health Mission Initiative chief.
""Given the military's unique, diverse, and rich data, this initiative has the potential to compliment other significant military medical advancements to include antisepsis, blood transfusions, and vaccines.”
Predictive Health is expected to end within 24 months, and the project might then make its way out to practitioners for further testing.
Through the Predictive Health project, DoD will aim to improve healthcare operations and outcomes.
""If you can cut down on the number of acute issues that come up that prevent people from doing their job, you essentially help our warfighting force,"" Higgins said.

7 Successful Ways To Use Artificial Intelligence To Improve Your Business ProcessesAdobe Stock

Here are seven ways AI is transforming everyday business processes for the better.

1. Improving meetings

Okay, so AI can’t eliminate meetings altogether. In fact, the coronavirus pandemic has shown us how maintaining human connections is vital, even from a distance – which means meetings are definitely here to stay. But AI can at least help to cut down the tiresome admin involved before, during, and after meetings.

PROMOTED
For example, voice assistants such as Google Duplex can schedule appointments for you. Then there’s Voicea’s EVA assistant, which can listen in on your meetings, capture key highlights and actions, and create and share actionable notes afterward. Another tool, called Sonia, does a similar thing, but is designed to capture client calls, transcribing the entire conversation, and automatically summarizing key items and actions.
2. Enhancing sales and marketing 
Many off-the-peg CRM solutions now incorporate AI analytics, enabling sales teams to automatically generate valuable insights. For example, Salesforce’s Einstein AI technology can predict which customers are most likely to generate more revenue, and which are most likely to take their custom elsewhere. Armed with knowledge like this, salespeople can focus their time and energy where it matters most.

Then there’s the widespread use of chatbots, which is helping organizations boost sales, drive revenue, and grow their audience. In one example, UK retailer Marks & Spencer added a virtual digital assistant function to its website to help customers solve common issues – a move which has reportedly saved millions of pounds worth of sales that would otherwise have been lost as frustrated customers bounce off the site.

3. Assessing and improving customer service
When it comes to call center operations, automation is nothing new; simple inquiries have been met with automated menu services for some time. But one tech company says it can help companies automatically judge the quality of human customer service calls. Transcosmos’s AI solution automatically assesses the quality of service given “at speed with human accuracy” – and can detect inappropriate and problematic customer service with more than twice the accuracy of a voice recognition system.

4. Improving product development processes
Generative design is a cutting-edge field that uses AI to augment the creative process. With generative design software, you simply input your design goals and other requirements and let the software explore all the possible designs that could fulfill those specifications – meaning you can quickly generate multiple designs from a single idea. The software does all the heavy lifting of working out what works and what doesn’t, saving many, many hours of time. Plus, you avoid the expense of creating prototypes that don’t deliver.
5. Automating content generation
This article wasn’t written by a robot. But it could have been. Because, thanks to AI, machines are now capable of generating engaging, informative text – to the extent that organizations like Forbes are producing articles with the help of AI.
From writing product descriptions and web copy, to industry articles and reports, there’s a range of AI-driven content tools available. For example, e-commerce leader Alibaba has come up with a tool called AI-CopyWriter that’s capable of generating more than 20,000 lines of copy in just one second.
6. Enhancing the manufacturing process
The use of robots in manufacturing is well established. But the latest generation of robotic systems is capable of working alongside humans and interacting seamlessly (and safely) with the human workforce. This has given rise to the term “cobots"" or collaborative robots.
Thanks to AI technologies like machine vision, cobots are aware of the humans around them and can react accordingly – for example, by adjusting their speed or reversing to avoid humans – meaning workflows can be designed to get the very best out of both humans and robots. Easy to program, fast to set up, and with an average price tag of around $24,000 each, cobots are a viable option to help smaller and mid-sized firms compete with larger manufacturers.
7. Refining recruitment 
HR may not seem an obvious match with AI. Yet AI is fast finding many uses in HR processes, including recruitment. For large employers like Unilever, which recruits around 30,000 people a year and handles 1.8 million applications, finding ways to streamline and improve the recruitment process is essential. That’s why Unilever partnered with AI recruitment specialist Pymetrics to create an online platform capable of conducting initial assessments of candidates in their own home. According to Unilever, around 70,000 person-hours of interviewing and assessing candidates have been cut thanks to this automated screening of candidates.

KANSAS CITY, MO (August 26, 2020) – The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture and the National Science Foundation announced today they are establishing seven new artificial intelligence institutes across the country to accelerate research, expand America's workforce and transform society for the future. Advancements in AI research have broad applications that can create economic, health and safety benefits across multiple industries and all levels of education.  This national network of Artificial Intelligence Research Institutes represents the nation's most significant federal investment in AI research and workforce development to date. The $20 million investment in each of five NSF AI institutes and two USDA-NIFA AI Institutes is just the beginning, with more institute announcements anticipated in the coming years.  “This major Federal investment in next generation agriculture signals our commitment to keeping American agricultural innovation on the leading edge of global science,” said USDA-NIFA Acting Director Parag Chitnis. “These future-focused centers of innovation will use the latest techniques from all corners of science including molecular science, engineering and robotics to seek solutions for myriad challenges facing agriculture, from crop improvement and animal welfare to labor shortages and farm safety.” By partnering U.S. scientific powerhouses USDA-NIFA and NSF with the U.S. Department of Homeland’s Security Science and Technology Directorate, the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Highway Administration and U.S. public research universities, these institutes will serve as hubs in a broader nationwide network determined to improve American competitiveness and transform key areas of society. The centers’ research will improve our national capacity in critical areas such as extreme weather preparedness, K-12 education advancement, next-generation workforce development and agricultural resilience and sustainability. Here are the specific focus areas: USDA-NIFA AI Institute for Next Generation Food Systems, led by a team at the University of California, Davis, integrates a holistic view of the food system with AI and bioinformatics to understand biological data and processes, addressing issues of molecular breeding to optimize traits for yield, crop quality, and pest/disease resistance; agricultural production, food processing and distribution, and nutrition. Major emphasis is on inclusive education and outreach approaches to build a diverse, next-generation workforce.  USDA-NIFA AI Institute for Future Agricultural Resilience, Management and Sustainability, sponsored by USDA-NIFA and led by a team at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, will advance AI research in computer vision, machine learning, soft object manipulation and intuitive human-robot interaction to solve major agricultural challenges including labor shortages, efficiency and welfare in animal agriculture, environmental resilience of crops, and the need to safeguard soil health. The institute features a new joint Computer Science+Agriculture degree and global clearinghouse to foster collaboration in AI-driven agriculture research. NSF AI Institute for Research on Trustworthy AI in Weather, Climate, and Coastal Oceanography, led by a team at the University of Oklahoma, Norman, assembles researchers in AI, atmospheric and ocean science, and risk communication to develop user-driven trustworthy AI that addresses pressing environmental concerns. With AI certificate programs aimed at workforce skills, the institute is providing the research and training necessary for the future workforce to deliver the advances needed to deal with environmental hazard challenges. NSF AI Institute for Foundations of Machine Learning, led by a team at the University of Texas, Austin, focuses on major theoretical challenges in AI, including next-generation algorithms for deep learning, neural architecture optimization and efficient robust statistics. The institute's partners include large industrial technology companies and the city of Austin. Major online coursework and research initiatives will bring current AI tools to thousands of students and professionals across the country. ​​ NSF AI Institute for Student-AI Teaming, led by a team at the University of Colorado, Boulder, is developing groundbreaking AI that helps both students and teachers work and learn together more effectively, engagingly and equitably. The vision is to develop “AI partners” that will observe, participate in and facilitate collaborative learning conversations by interacting naturally through speech, gesture, gaze and facial expression in real-world classrooms. NSF AI Institute for Molecular Discovery, Synthetic Strategy and Manufacturing (or the NSF Molecular Maker Lab Institute), led by a team at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, focuses on development of new AI-enabled tools and serves as a training ground for the next generation of scientists with combined expertise in chemical synthesis and bioengineering. NSF AI Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions, led by a team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in Cambridge, incorporates workforce development, digital learning, outreach and knowledge transfer programs to advance physics knowledge -- from the smallest building blocks of nature to the largest structures in the universe -- and galvanize AI research innovation to broaden societal impacts.  “The AI institutes being awarded today comprise large, multi-disciplinary, and multi-sector collaborations: they bring together consortia of dozens of universities and other organizations, ultimately spanning academia, government, and industry,” said Michael Kratsios, U.S. Chief Technology Officer. “In effect, over the next five years, some of the best minds in the country will be tackling some of the grandest challenges that we face, both in terms of new AI techniques as well as breakthroughs in fields of science and engineering and sectors of our economy. And along the way, they will nurture the future American workforce in AI research and practice.” Learn more about the USDA-NIFA AI Institutes at nifa.usda.gov and the NSF AI Institutes(link is external) and artificial intelligence research(link is external) by visiting nsf.gov(link is external).NIFA invests in and advances agricultural research, education and extension and seeks to make transformative discoveries that solve societal challenges. This research supports Value-Added Innovations, Sustainable Ag Intensification, and Food and Nutrition Translation themes outlined in the USDA Science Blueprint and moves us closer to meeting the goals outlined in USDA’s Agriculture Innovation Agenda.  ###
