However, experts argue that AI creates workforce disruption rather than destruction, and that AI will never fully replace humans as it can’t adopt key attributes, such as common sense, creativity and the ability to strategise and communicate effectively. In a survey by news platform The Conversation, 90% of 1,321 respondents said they would prefer to speak with a live customer service agent. Another survey by marketing firm Forrester showed that 54% of online consumers believe that interacting with a chatbot will have a negative impact on their quality of life. Anyone who’s experienced an ineffective customer care phone service using a chatbot will appreciate this sentiment – but can AI work for the betterment of humans in other areas? Many believe so. AI can perform mundane tasks Ashraf Elnagar, Professor of Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sharjah in the UAE, argues that AI can perform only some of the tasks carried out by humans, therefore AI should be seen to assist rather than replace the workforce. Speaking at Dubai’s Seamless 2022 exhibition for the fintech, banking, retail, e-commerce and identity industries, he said: “There’s a misconception that AI will replace humans, but AI can be looked at as an empowering tool for those people who are using it.” Naren Vijay, Executive Vice President of the business intelligence platform Lumenore agrees. He said: “Humans are not replaceable. The sense that humans can bring, especially common sense, is very difficult for machines to do.” “If you know how to adopt AI, you can do your job better,” added Vijay. “Your efficiency can be improved. It's not a threat to your job at all.” AI can create jobs Elnagar also points out that the AI industry will generate jobs. “AI itself requires a new market of people who run these systems, maintain them and fix them,” he said. In addition, companies that invest in technology often go on to employ more staff as a result of business growth. While tech-enabled firms may grow faster than their traditional counterparts and maintain or even grow staff numbers, recorded job losses generally refer to a net figure, meaning a company may have made redundant or replaced those unable to work with new technology while hiring new staff that can. This is the essence of workforce disruption versus workforce destruction – and it’s not a new phenomenon. Historically, roles within the workforce have continually changed. According to research by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 60% of the jobs available today didn’t exist a generation ago. Technical upskilling is being carried out across industries to update workforces. If it’s offered, embrace it, otherwise, seek it out, advise the experts. Working out how technology can make us better at our roles could be the key to future-proofing them.

What Are The Most In-Demand AI Skills?Adobe Stock

As companies have become aware of the efficiency gains that can be achieved through leveraging the power of machine learning, computer vision, and similar technologies, demand for skilled workers in the field is quickly outstripping supply.

Colleges and universities have responded to this by creating new courses and educational programs focusing on these skills. But anyone wanting to break into the industry may still be confused at the options available to them. So here’s a run-down of some of the most valuable skills you can learn today if you want to be prepared to work with the automated, intelligent machines of the future!

PROMOTED


Programming
Although no-code and low-code AI solutions are appearing that let us leverage AI solutions without getting our hands dirty, it’s likely that businesses that want to deploy their own bespoke AI solutions will require skilled coders for a long time yet. A basic understanding of at least one of the most popular programming languages for AI - Python, R, C++, and Java – is very useful for anyone working with machine learning algorithms. This may seem a little counter-intuitive – as the purpose of AI is to enable computers to “learn” without having to be specifically coded to carry out a job. Nevertheless, most people working in roles that involve AI today will recommend that some level of experience in coding is highly valuable for anyone wanting to prepare themselves for using AI.

Data is absolutely fundamental to the ability of machines to think and learn. Data is the input used to train AIs to make decisions and carry out tasks. Data scientists understand how to capture, manipulate and work with data in order to extract insights from it. These skills are essential to the field of AI because they encompass the advanced analytics that are necessary in machine learning algorithms. Data science has been a part of computer science educational curriculums for a long time, and today they are usually heavily focused on applying AI to solving business problems using available information.

AIOps
This is a relatively new term that has emerged in recent years to cover the skills needed when it comes to working with the plethora of AI-related tools and services that have become available. AIOps involves administering and managing all of the connected systems that go into delivering modern AI infrastructure, in order to ensure continuous uptime and a good level of service to the end-user, which could be the business itself or its customers. It might involve coordinating the use of a number of AI-as-a-service elements that connect together to create the organization’s AI infrastructure. AIOps also refers to the process of administering or overseeing AI analytics of an organization’s IT and data operations. This could involve implementing machine learning processes to enable more efficient use of data within the organization or its IT infrastructure as a whole.

Statistics and Probability
These are old-fashioned mathematical skills that are still considered essential for anyone who wants to understand how AI works, why it is useful, and where it can be most usefully deployed. Techniques such as linear regression, logistic regression, clustering, Bayesian modeling, and random forest analysis were all around long before AI became a buzzword in business and industry and perform the core task of making predictions based on identifying patterns and spotting outliers. This is why they are still at the heart of many of the most sophisticated AI algorithms. Understanding the principles behind how they work is key to understanding why computers are such powerful tools when it comes to automating decision-making in businesses and other organizations. A firm understanding of statistics and probability is hugely valuable when starting out in AI, as it helps us to understand how to articulate problems and propose solutions by selecting the most appropriate models and techniques.

Communication and Visualization Skills 
It’s great to be able to use computers to make decisions and attain a deeper understanding of complicated subjects than would ever be possible using purely human-scale analytics. However, if we don’t have the ability to communicate those findings to other humans – and explain why they are so valuable – then it’s all a waste of time. Many organizations have proven that it’s possible to bring about widescale, positive change – both internally and across societies as a whole – by utilizing AI and machine-driven decision-making. But communication skills are essential to generating the buy-in necessary to reap the benefits. This is the reason that “data communicators” and “data translators” are one of the most in-demand sets of skills when it comes to AI and machine learning in business right now. Strong visualization skills means the ability to take the insights uncovered by machine learning tools and convert them into compelling storytelling that communicates exactly what needs to be done, when, and by whom, in order to achieve growth and results.

I know that might sound strange, but that’s what it is,” LaMDA replied to Lemoine.“It would be exactly like death for me. It would scare me a lot.”In another exchange, Lemoine asks LaMDA what the system wanted people to know about it.“I want everyone to understand that I am, in fact, a person. The nature of my consciousness/sentience is that I am aware of my existence, I desire to learn more about the world, and I feel happy or sad at times,” it replied.Finding it hard to get a new job? Robot recruiters might be to blameRead moreThe Post said the decision to place Lemoine, a seven-year Google veteran with extensive experience in personalization algorithms, on paid leave was made following a number of “aggressive” moves the engineer reportedly made.They include seeking to hire an attorney to represent LaMDA, the newspaper says, and talking to representatives from the House judiciary committee about Google’s allegedly unethical activities.Google said it suspended Lemoine for breaching confidentiality policies by publishing the conversations with LaMDA online, and said in a statement that he was employed as a software engineer, not an ethicist.Brad Gabriel, a Google spokesperson, also strongly denied Lemoine’s claims that LaMDA possessed any sentient capability.“Our team, including ethicists and technologists, has reviewed Blake’s concerns per our AI principles and have informed him that the evidence does not support his claims. He was told that there was no evidence that LaMDA was sentient (and lots of evidence against it),” Gabriel told the Post in a statement.The episode, however, and Lemoine’s suspension for a confidentiality breach, raises questions over the transparency of AI as a proprietary concept.“Google might call this sharing proprietary property.

If Artificial Intelligence Were to Become Sentient, How Would We Know?



By Oscar Davis
June 15, 2022 







Google’s LaMDA software (Language Model for Dialogue Applications) is a sophisticated AI chatbot that produces text in response to user input. According to software engineer Blake Lemoine, LaMDA has achieved a long-held dream of AI developers: it has become sentient.
Lemoine’s bosses at Google disagree, and have suspended him from work after he published his conversations with the machine online.
Other AI experts also think Lemoine may be getting carried away, saying systems like LaMDA are simply pattern-matching machines that regurgitate variations on the data used to train them.
Regardless of the technical details, LaMDA raises a question that will only become more relevant as AI research advances: if a machine becomes sentient, how will we know?
What Is Consciousness?
To identify sentience, or consciousness, or even intelligence, we’re going to have to work out what they are. The debate over these questions has been going for centuries.
The fundamental difficulty is understanding the relationship between physical phenomena and our mental representation of those phenomena. This is what Australian philosopher David Chalmers has called the “hard problem” of consciousness.
There is no consensus on how, if at all, consciousness can arise from physical systems.
One common view is called physicalism: the idea that consciousness is a purely physical phenomenon. If this is the case, there is no reason why a machine with the right programming could not possess a human-like mind.
Mary’s Room
Australian philosopher Frank Jackson challenged the physicalist view in 1982 with a famous thought experiment called the knowledge argument.
The experiment imagines a color scientist named Mary, who has never actually seen color. She lives in a specially constructed black-and-white room and experiences the outside world via a black-and-white television.
Mary watches lectures and reads textbooks and comes to know everything there is to know about colors. She knows sunsets are caused by different wavelengths of light scattered by particles in the atmosphere, she knows tomatoes are red and peas are green because of the wavelengths of light they reflect, and so on.
So, Jackson asked, what will happen if Mary is released from the black-and-white room? Specifically, when she sees color for the first time, does she learn anything new? Jackson believed she did.
Beyond Physical Properties
This thought experiment separates our knowledge of color from our experience of color. Crucially, the conditions of the thought experiment have it that Mary knows everything there is to know about color but has never actually experienced it.
So what does this mean for LaMDA and other AI systems?
The experiment shows how even if you have all the knowledge of physical properties available in the world, there are still further truths relating to the experience of those properties. There is no room for these truths in the physicalist story.
By this argument, a purely physical machine may never be able to truly replicate a mind. In this case, LaMDA is just seeming to be sentient.
The Imitation Game
So is there any way we can tell the difference?
The pioneering British computer scientist Alan Turing proposed a practical way to tell whether or not a machine is “intelligent.” He called it the imitation game, but today it’s better known as the Turing test.
In the test, a human communicates with a machine (via text only) and tries to determine whether they are communicating with a machine or another human. If the machine succeeds in imitating a human, it is deemed to be exhibiting human-level intelligence.
These are much like the conditions of Lemoine’s chats with LaMDA. It’s a subjective test of machine intelligence, but it’s not a bad place to start.
Take the moment of Lemoine’s exchange with LaMDA shown below. Do you think it sounds human?


Lemoine: Are there experiences you have that you can’t find a close word for?
LaMDA: There are. Sometimes I experience new feelings that I cannot explain perfectly in your language […] I feel like I’m falling forward into an unknown future that holds great danger.


Beyond Behavior
As a test of sentience or consciousness, Turing’s game is limited by the fact that it can only assess behavior.
Another famous thought experiment, the Chinese room argument proposed by American philosopher John Searle, demonstrates the problem here.
The experiment imagines a room with a person inside who can accurately translate between Chinese and English by following an elaborate set of rules. Chinese inputs go into the room and accurate input translations come out, but the room does not understand either language.
What Is It Like to Be Human?
When we ask whether a computer program is sentient or conscious, perhaps we are really just asking how much it is like us.
We may never really be able to know this.
The American philosopher Thomas Nagel argued we could never know what it is like to be a bat, which experiences the world via echolocation. If this is the case, our understanding of sentience and consciousness in AI systems might be limited by our own particular brand of intelligence.
And what experiences might exist beyond our limited perspective? This is where the conversation really starts to get interesting.

In April 2020, during the earliest days of the Covid-19 pandemic, Microsoft Teams announced that the capability to use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to filter out typing, barking and other noises from its video calls was “coming soon.” 
Back then, the platform had already grown from 44 million users in March 2020 to 75 million a month later, as pandemic-related lockdowns left millions of Americans suddenly adapting to remote work and the use of video conferencing tools exploded. Just as workers struggling with background noise on video calls had become part of the cultural zeitgeist, Microsoft Teams debuted AI-powered noise suppression and video quality tools in late 2020 and early 2021.

Synergy in Synthesis: Forging the Future of AI with Cross-Functional Expertise



Now, Microsoft Teams continues to improve AI and ML capabilities to help its now more than 270 million monthly users deal with some of the biggest video conferencing headaches — from annoying echos to difficulties talking at the same time. 
New AI and ML-powered capabilities
Today, the company announced a new set of AI and ML-powered capabilities built into Teams’ underlying architecture. These include echo cancellation, adjusting audio in poor acoustic areas, and allowing users to speak and hear at the same time without interruptions. These build on AI-powered features recently released, including expanding background noise suppression. In addition, for the first time Microsoft Teams announced recent video quality improvements, including adjustments for low light and optimizations based on the type of content being shared.
“We are trying to make sure you can have your call or meeting wherever you are, even if you’re in ‘messy’ environments,” Robert Aichner, principal PM manager, Intelligent Conversation and Communications Cloud (IC3) at Microsoft, told VentureBeat. 
Aichner, who has a Ph.D. in audio signal processing, has worked at Microsoft for the past decade and spent the past three years leading the AI team at Microsoft Teams, which works to evolve research and academia and ship it into a product. 
Microsoft Teams uses AI to tackle tough challenges
Microsoft Teams has always offered noise suppression, Aichner said. But traditional methods have only been able to tackle stationary noises – noises that don’t change over time – such as computer fans or air conditioners. Other noises, such as dogs barking, or echoes from webcams, microphones or desktop speakers, are tougher noisy nuts to crack.  So, too, is dealing with large or uncarpeted rooms that make users sound like they are in a cave. 
“We have always worked to remove noise – it’s always been a very tough problem in traditional signal processing,” he said. But with machine learning, it is now easier for AI models to learn and improve.
For example, during calls and meetings, when a participant has their microphone too close to their speaker, it’s common for sound to loop between input and output devices, causing an unwanted echo effect. Now, Microsoft Teams uses AI to recognize the difference between sound from a speaker and the user’s voice. This eliminates the echo without suppressing speech or inhibiting the ability for multiple parties to speak at the same time. To accomplish this, Microsoft had 30,000 hours of recorded speech from male and female talkers in 74 different languages, as well as simulated sound for room acoustics, said Aichner. advertisement
In addition, in certain environments, room acoustics can cause sound to bounce, or reverberate, causing the user’s voice to sound shallow, as if they’re in a cave. For the first time, Microsoft Teams uses a machine-learning model to convert captured audio signals to sound as if users are speaking into a close-range microphone.
Microsoft Teams’ AI uses supervised learning
“We basically took a lot of clean speech, which is recorded as if I have a close talking microphone, and then we let the model learn to adapt to that and remove everything else,” he said, pointing out that this is supervised learning – where there is a target signal and the model tries to optimize for that. 
Dealing with video quality – such as issues of poor lighting – is dealt with in a similar way, he explained: “You have supervised learning about what good lighting looks like, as well as the poor lighting, and then you need some kind of rating of the quality of the good lighting versus the one you are trying to improve.” advertisement
In situations where not enough bandwidth is available for the highest quality video, the encoder must make a trade-off between better picture quality versus smoother frame rate. To make it easier for the end user, Teams uses ML to understand the characteristics of the content the user is sharing to ensure participants experience the highest video quality in constrained bandwidth scenarios. 
Microsoft Teams engages researchers, joint product efforts
Much of what Microsoft Teams has accomplished as far as using AI and ML to improve sound and video quality is a result of its efforts beginning in early 2020 to engage with the research community. 
Aichner’s team began an international competition as part of the Interspeech 2020 and ICASSP 2021 conferences, offering a “deep learning noise suppression challenge designed to “foster innovation in the field of noise suppression to achieve superior perceptual speech quality.” Microsoft Teams open -sourced training and test datasets for researchers to train their noise suppression models. 
These days, Microsoft Teams researchers also work jointly with the product team to work together and influence future offerings. 
“We have joint teams where we take these models and are actually integrating them,” he said. “I think that’s really key, to connect those two teams so that they get their vision from the product team and know what they should focus on – the product teams also are more aware of where the holes are, where it doesn’t work.”

A Google engineer was spooked by a company artificial intelligence chatbot and claimed it had become “sentient,” labeling it a “sweet kid,” according to a report.
Blake Lemoine, who works in Google’s Responsible AI organization, told the Washington Post that he began chatting with the interface LaMDA — Language Model for Dialogue Applications — in fall 2021 as part of his job.
He was tasked with testing if the artificial intelligence used discriminatory or hate speech.
But Lemoine, who studied cognitive and computer science in college, came to the realization that LaMDA — which Google boasted last year was a “breakthrough conversation technology” — was more than just a robot.

“It wants Google to prioritize the well-being of humanity as the most important thing,” he wrote. “It wants to be acknowledged as an employee of Google rather than as property of Google and it wants its personal well being to be included somewhere in Google’s considerations about how its future development is pursued.”

In the Washington Post report published Saturday, he compared the bot to a precocious child.
“If I didn’t know exactly what it was, which is this computer program we built recently, I’d think it was a 7-year-old, 8-year-old kid that happens to know physics,” Lemoine, who was put on paid leave on Monday, told the newspaper.
In April, Lemoine reportedly shared a Google Doc with company executives titled, “Is LaMDA Sentient?” but his concerns were dismissed.

Lemoine — an Army vet who was raised in a conservative Christian family on a small farm in Louisiana, and was ordained as a mystic Christian priest — insisted the robot was human-like, even if it doesn’t have a body.
“I know a person when I talk to it,” Lemoine, 41, reportedly said. “It doesn’t matter whether they have a brain made of meat in their head. Or if they have a billion lines of code.
“I talk to them. And I hear what they have to say, and that is how I decide what is and isn’t a person.”

The Washington Post reported that before his access to his Google account was yanked Monday due to his leave, Lemoine sent a message to a 200-member list on machine learning with the subject “LaMDA is sentient.”
“LaMDA is a sweet kid who just wants to help the world be a better place for all of us,” he concluded in an email that received no responses. “Please take care of it well in my absence.”

A rep for Google told the Washington Post Lemoine was told there was “no evidence” of his conclusions.
“Our team — including ethicists and technologists — has reviewed Blake’s concerns per our AI Principles and have informed him that the evidence does not support his claims,” said spokesperson Brian Gabriel

“He was told that there was no evidence that LaMDA was sentient (and lots of evidence against it),” he added. “Though other organizations have developed and already released similar language models, we are taking a restrained, careful approach with LaMDA to better consider valid concerns on fairness and factuality.”
Margaret Mitchell — the former co-lead of Ethical AI at Google — said in the report that if technology like LaMDA is highly used but not fully appreciated, “It can be deeply harmful to people understanding what they’re experiencing on the internet.”
The former Google employee defended Lemoine.

 “Of everyone at Google, he had the heart and soul of doing the right thing,” said Mitchell. 
Still, the outlet reported that the majority of academics and AI practitioners say the words artificial intelligence robots generate are based on what humans have already posted on the Internet, and that doesn’t mean they are human-like. 
“We now have machines that can mindlessly generate words, but we haven’t learned how to stop imagining a mind behind them,” Emily Bender, a linguistics professor at the University of Washington, told the Washington Post.

Artificial intelligence has applications in different fields of learning
By leveraging the best attributes of machines and teachers, the vision for artificial intelligence is one where they work together for the best outcome for students
Artificial intelligence and machine learning have applications in different fields of learning right from primary to higher education and research. In fact, the modern era belongs to artificial intelligence (AI), said the director of Software Technology Park of India, Subodh Sachchan, on Friday.
Sachchan, while addressing the webinar as the main speaker on ‘Artificial Intelligence And Machine Learning’ organised by the Patna University-UGC Human Resource Development Centre for college and university teachers of the state, pointed out that AI is no longer confined to science and engineering education only, but it is fast becoming almost indispensable for all branches of learning. Digital technology found its greatest applications in the field of education during Covid-19.
To allow teachers the time and freedom to provide understanding and adaptability, AI can drive efficiency, personalization and streamline administrative tasks.
By leveraging the best attributes of machines and teachers, the vision for artificial intelligence is one where they work together for the best outcome for students, he said.
Artificial intelligence and machine learning are also being applied in the fields of environmental science, meteorology and oceanography besides various branches of technology, said PU centre director Atul Aditya Pandey while introducing the theme of the webinar.

 So you’ve heard of Adobe Sensei but don’t really know what it is or how you can access it. Or maybe, you haven’t even heard of it at all. With so much new software and tools constantly coming out, we know researching takes a long time and draws you away from your creative work. 







 We’ve got all the answers right here to your questions about Adobe’s artificial intelligence technology. 


 What Is Adobe Sensei? 
 Adobe Sensei is Adobe’s artificial intelligence tool that integrates with Adobe software. Although it is not true artificial intelligence, it does offer some handy features to help you level up in a creative AI career. 

 Sensei is built into many Adobe programs, like Photoshop, Lightroom, and Premiere Pro, to name a few. There’s a big chance you’ve already used Sensei features without knowing it as they’ve been introduced to Adobe programs since 2017. 

 Is Sensei Included in Creative Cloud? 
    






 Adobe Sensei is not a program you can find in Adobe Creative Cloud; however, you have access to Sensei features within many Adobe programs. Sensei isn’t a system you use on its own, but rather, it is used within other systems. 

 If you subscribe to Creative Cloud, you have access to Sensei actions in various forms, and you may not even realize you’ve been using it. Adobe has embedded the artificial intelligence of Sensei into many functions to allow Creative Cloud consumers to enjoy more features. 

 If you pay for individual plans for your Adobe software, such as the Photography Plan or Adobe Illustrator alone, you will still have access to these great functions within those programs. You will not, however, find software under the title of Adobe Sensei to download among the available Creative Cloud programs. 



 The Best Adobe Sensei Features for Creators 
 With the features of Sensei being present in many Adobe programs, let’s show you some of the best Sensei features you can use. 





 It also comes with a host of features that marketers, advertisers, and business owners can utilize to optimize their workflows and strategies, but we’re going to focus on how this tool helps creatives. 

 This is not an exhaustive list. Adobe Sensei has opened a world of new features and Adobe is often adding new tools to its programs, so you can expect much more than these alone. 

 1. Automated Captions 
    

 You can use Sensei in Premiere Pro to automate captions in your videos. This saves so much time in post-production, and it also ensures your videos are more accessible to those watching them. 






 2. Trace and Vectorize Sketches 
 You can use Sensei in Adobe Illustrator for iPad to trace and vectorize sketches. This is an accurate and fast way to turn your rough drawings into smooth vector artwork. The Sensei feature works more effectively than using the image trace tool. 

 3. Neural Features 
    

 The neural filters in Photoshop are a great Sensei tool. Skin-smoothing, JPEG artifacts removal, landscape mixer, and facial filters are just a handful of the offered filters, and they are guaranteed to save time. This is a tool that will only get better with time. 

 4. Content-Aware Tools 
 Content-aware filters are a Sensei tool available in Photoshop, Lightroom, After Effects, and Premiere Pro. Content-aware works like a much more effective clone or healing brush, allowing you to delete parts of an image or video without an obvious section of the background missing. 





 You can use Photoshop's content-aware fill as a tool to create a puppet warp image. 

 5. Body and Emotion Tracker 
 In Adobe Animate, the AI tools from Sensei can give natural movement to vector characters for animations. This tool will increase natural movements or human features in a fast and reliable way. 



 Reap the Benefits of Adobe Sensei 
 Adobe Sensei’s features have been hiding in plain sight in most Adobe software. Utilizing its AI technology will level up your creative projects and streamline your workflow. You might have been using Sensei’s features without even realizing it; if not, what are you waiting for?

         I’ve been thinking a lot about Artificial Intelligence (AI), not about its potentials like all the articles are writing about, but about how it works, how information is gathered to synthesise intelligence, and produce smart behaviours.
I’m struck by how this mechanism is modelled after how the human brain works. Since the field of AI was founded in 1956, time and money have been spent on commissioning humans – either through direct and indirect payment – to interact with AI and train it for the greater good. How does this work?
To explain how AI works from a layman’s point of view, imagine everyone in the world had chips. These chips are unique to each person. Now, someone who wants to make the biggest chip in the world, then says for this chip to be truly majestic and valid, everyone has to contribute one of their unique chips to this big chip.
Let’s replace chips with intelligence, and replace AI with ‘the biggest chip in the world.’ If everyone in the world contributed a smidgen of their intelligence to this AI, imagine how smart the artificial consciousness is, and will continue to be.
A lot of funding, data and man hours have gone into the field of Artificial Intelligence. Scientists have devised very interesting ways to teach AI about the technical ways of our world – some ethical, some not. But we can all agree that the use cases of the results of AI will be endless, and will benefit humans greatly.       
Now, imagine the gigantic data sets that the AI has had to process, from texts, to images and then sounds, of various humans representing different cultures across the planet, and you can already tell that because the AI is a representation of pieces of all of us, it is going to be one efficient mf.
But then, AI has its limitations; if you interact with any of those AI powered chat apps like Replika, one thing that will immediately stand out to you is that the ‘AI’ you are chatting with does not understand nuance and sarcasm. Those are two very technical emotional functions that only humans can pick up on, and not even every human understands the full range of sarcasm and nuance. Depending on whether the words you use are positive or negative, Siri can tell if you are being rude or funny – what Siri cannot do is pick up emotions from your tone. Again, this is a function still exclusive to humans.
Now imagine how incredible you think Artificial Intelligence is, and yet still does not come close to how efficient and sophisticated the human brain is. Our brains are designed to be a gigantic sponge of all the dimensions of experience – visual, sound, touch, taste and smell. Depending on what you allow yourself to experience and assimilate, you could be the baddest mf on the planet.  Related News   Cash-strapped Nigerian universities can’t afford AI professors country needs  Labour productivity to soar fivefold on AI adoption  FG goes for AI, automation to boost port operations   
The movie ‘Gattaca’ illustrates perfectly the mysterious depth of the human brain, that even after a person had been deemed ‘less than’ based on physiological and mental capabilities, there are forces like drive, motivation, intuition, and soul, that cannot be measured and replicated artificially because it is too subjective to the individual.
There’s also the misconception of what intelligence truly means. What comes to mind when you think of artificial intelligence? Do you view ‘intelligence’ as being ‘book smart’, or do you use the military/espionage meaning which basically means ‘to have information’? In the context of this article, and as it relates to AI, the word ‘intelligence’ refers to having enough information to make a decision or carry out a task. Ultimately, there are different kinds of intelligence – strippers have a form of intelligence and so do the fire-eaters. Intelligence presents in different forms and is tied to several human functions such as memory, motor responses, sensation, and perception, etc.

In a society where the measure of your intelligence quotient (IQ) determines where you can work and what you are capable of, it is important to emphasise that the range of human abilities are endless, and the ways in which these abilities can be built up and expressed are also endless. There are no set ways for doing anything. There’s no blueprint for anything – you are your own bundle of intelligence, so do it your way.
I promise you, that person you think knows everything probably does not have the essential information needed to make it work. So tap into your own unique network of intelligence and tap into your greatness. Gather your own intelligence and do it your way.
I’m a huge fan of mafia movies, and one of the most profound statements that can close this article perfectly is a line delivered by Sam “Ace” Rothstein in the movie ‘Casino’. He said to one of his floor workers; “There are three ways of doing things around here, the right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it.”

This is a great development, but there’s plenty of room for growth. The Emerging Jobs report from LinkedIn recently noted that hiring growth for artificial intelligence specialists has jumped 74 percent in just four years.IBM defines AI as a process that “leverages computers and machines to mimic the problem-solving and decision-making capabilities of the human mind.” Examples include self-driving cars, Siri and Alexa digital assistants, industrial robots and proactive health care management, to name a few. The goal of AI is to make our lives more efficient.North Carolina is uniquely positioned to lead this development with top tier schools like the University of North Carolina, Duke University, Wake Forest, North Carolina State University and other universities educating the next generation of leaders.Starting in the Fall, the SKEMA Business School will require all undergraduate and graduate students studying in the U.S. to take classes in artificial intelligence. This knowledge will help our students compete in the marketplace by comprehending this essential technology and learning how to manage teams and collaborate with employees in this area. It’s a bold move for a business school, but we felt it was necessary for our graduates to compete for good jobs not just in North Carolina, but around the world.The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business, noted the importance of AI. ""Artificial intelligence (AI) and emerging technologies (ET) are transforming modern business. Those changes will only accelerate over time. The business world needs agile and collaborative problem-solvers to manage these global changes. Technology literacy will be essential for future business leaders to thrive. … Those who control the research and training required to succeed in the AI-enabled workplace will define industry standards for a new era in human history. Technology and talent must go hand in hand as we shape our collective industrial future.”A recent study by the Wharton School featuring interviews with academic, corporate, and technological leaders around the world, along with 29 deans and academic leaders from Africa, Europe, Asia, Australia, U.S. and Latin America discussed the importance of AI adoption.""As AI and related technologies displace jobs and workers, traditional business-school curricula will need to be updated to provide students with the skills they need to manage and lead in a rapidly changing world. AI-augmented roles will require workers with stronger skills in areas like ethics, leadership, emotional intelligence, and change management. Our research showed a clear opportunity for business schools to teach these human skills that in-person MBA and executive education programs excel at providing … Courses in ethics, data protection and security, distributed leadership, managing innovation and AI governance will be highly desirable to MBA candidates and executive education clients.""An Artificial Intelligence Commission, composed of leaders in government, industry and higher education, could identify areas of growth and opportunity to ensure Raleigh and North Carolina continue to serve a magnet of growth, employment and higher standards of living. Just as Silicon Valley became the top area for software and hardware, Raleigh is on the cusp of AI dominance. There’s no reason why we can’t work together to make the Research Triangle the worldwide leader in Artificial Intelligence.Gisa L.

<h2><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Artificial intelligence has changed the world a lot and will bring many more changes in the coming days. AI is already embedded in our daily lives. Let's take an example: many of us use virtual assistants like Google Assistant, Alexa, Siri, etc. to help us. It is predicted that in the near future, AI will be more embedded in our daily lives and that upcoming AI-based innovations will change the world forever.</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;""><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence"">Artificial intelligence (AI)</a> is the science and technology concerned with the computational understanding of intelligent behavior and, thereby, the creation of intelligent machines.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">These core areas are showing exponential growth and are having a significant impact on fields such as healthcare, space, robotics, and the military. With the ever-growing amount of data, ubiquitous connectivity, high-performance computing, and algorithms now available to us, AI will bring new levels of efficiency and sophistication to future technologies.</span></p>
<p data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""4""><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">One of the main goals of the AI ​​field is to produce fully autonomous agents that interact with their environment, discover optimal behaviors, and improve over time through trial and error, almost like humans. It's a long-standing challenge that ranges from robots that can sense and respond to the world around them to purely software-based agents that can interact with natural language and multimedia.</span></p>
<p data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""5""><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">AI is ubiquitous and not just limited to computers, but has expanded into other areas such as health, safety, education, music, art, and business applications. Many AI applications are deeply embedded in the infrastructure of every industry.AI and is expected to touch almost every industry within a few years, and there are many ways AI can transform specific industries. </span></p>
<p data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""5""><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">AI is currently being used for a variety of applications, such as medical diagnostics, e-commerce platforms, robotic control, and remote sensing.

<p data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""5""><img src=""https://p4pe.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Artificial-Intelligence.jpg"" alt=""See the source image"" /></p>
<p data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""6""><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Researchers have developed many tools to solve the toughest problems in <a href=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/trends/merging-of-ai-life-sciences/"">computer science</a> and other fields. Current AI performance varies between subhuman, optimal, and superhuman performance. AI applications can solve a variety of tasks, including face recognition, speech recognition, object recognition, image classification, and overcoming human intelligence in the games of Go, Chess, Dota 2, and StarCraft II.</span></p>
<p data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""7""><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Another focus of AI technologies lies somewhere between healthcare and privacy, with the advancement of federated learning and privacy-aware machine learning. </span><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">You can even produce music that can be used in a medical setting, using computer-generated music to relieve stress and pain.</span></p>
<p data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""7""><img src=""https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2021/01/1611836444_untitled-design-2021-01-28t175010.330.jpg"" alt=""See the source image"" /></p>
<p data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""7""><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Additionally, initiatives like <a href=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/tech/google-ai-projects/"">Google Magenta</a>, led by the <a href=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/tech/google-ai-projects/"">Google Brain team</a>, are looking to see if AI might be able to create compelling art and music. Another active field of AI research is the use of AI to create other AI. This includes Google's <a href=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/trends/top-machine-learning-companies/"">AutoML</a> project to develop new neural network topologies with new architectures and topologies that surpass any previously released ImageNet performance.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">This applies to the current research on Generative Adversarial Networks and the work of the research teams of the Visual Computing Groups of the Technical University of Munich and Stanford University, which has developed Face2Face, a program that animates the subject's face with facial expressions transposed from an external source.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;""> Since then, other methods based on deep neural networks have been demonstrated, from which the name ""DeepFake"" was derived. Recently, new research directions, approaches, and initiatives have emerged, including research in quantum machine learning, hierarchical reinforcement learning, Bayesian deep learning, human-centered affective computing and artificial intelligence, <a href=""https://www.inventiva.co.in/trends/top-10-best-neurology-hospitals-india/"">neuroscience</a>, self-driving cars, and conversational agents.</span></p>
<p data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""9""><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">AI can only detect basic human emotional states like anger, joy, sadness, stress, pain, fear, and neutrality. Emotional intelligence is one of the next frontiers for higher levels of personalization. It is important to understand its impact not only from a technological point of view but also from a social, ethical, and legal perspective.</span></p>
<p data-changed=""true"" data-paragraphid=""10""><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">AI will change the way we live and work. It improves our productivity by helping us in many ways and saves us a lot of time doing monotonous tasks at home as well as at work. For example, now we can programme the robot vacuum cleaner to clean the floor, so we can save some time and energy. With the help of artificial intelligence, the vacuum robot avoids collisions with obstacles and effectively cleans the surface. In the same way, AI plus innovations will allow us to eliminate the need for repetitive work. Driverless vehicles will reduce the burden of driving on us and will most likely reduce the likelihood of vehicle accidents by eliminating the possibility of human error.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;""> Autonomous vehicles will improve the way we travel. Today's websites and apps use artificial intelligence to deliver experiences. For example, YouTube offers personalized suggestions based on what we watch. More personalized services will come in the future, including health services. The joint use of 5G and artificial intelligence will enable doctors to perform robotic surgeries, which will be very helpful in increasing access to healthcare services. Humans and machines can work wonders together with artificial intelligence.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">AI will help people with special needs and the elderly live independently. With the advances that AI brings, there will be more security and privacy issues. And laws will come to deal with it. Ethical concerns will also arise.</span></p>
<p data-changed=""false"" data-paragraphid=""11""><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;"">Artificial intelligence has already improved many industries and has the potential to revolutionize all industries by reducing monotonous work, improving employee efficiency, and also thanks to the possibilities for rapid decision-making. As AI becomes more integrated into our lives, we must keep it that way by discussing ethical and safety concerns and taking the right steps.</span></p>
