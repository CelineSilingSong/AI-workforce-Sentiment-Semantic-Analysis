Generative AI – those large language models that can create new content based on a prompt from a user – has been in widespread use for nearly a year, since the release of ChatGPT.  Legal professionals have taken a particular interest, according to Zach Warren. Warren is the manager of Technology and Innovation at the Thomson Reuters Institute. On the recent webcast “Making sense of the intersection between AI and legal professionals,” he noted that a full 82 percent of legal professionals believe generative AI can be used for legal work. That’s a significant number for a profession that sometimes moves slowly with new technology.  Warren was joined on the webcast by Zena Applebaum, VP of Product Marketing for Thomson Reuters, and Andrew Fletcher, Director of AI Strategy & Partnerships for Thomson Reuters Labs. Zena Applebaum, VP, Product Marketing, Thomson ReutersAndrew Fletcher, Director, AI Strategy and Partnerships, Thomson Reuters LabsZach Warren, Manager, Technology and Innovation, Thomson Reuters Institute      What is generative AI? Generative AI refers to a subset of AI that uses deep learning algorithms to generate new data, text, images, and even videos that mimic the characteristics of human-generated content. Applebaum noted that, “You can ask a question as though there were someone in the room with you, and the tech will generate new content – like a summary of bulleted list overview of a document.” ChatGPT, Bard, and CoPilot are examples of open model tools available now.   How does generative AI support legal work? Fletcher noted the distinction between automation- taking the human out of the task – and augmentation – humans using a tool to complete a task.  “Automation is done with caution because when you’re dealing with wanting to focus on accuracy and outcomes being correct, you need to be pretty confident the automation is going to deliver what it is that you need,” he said. “It’s appropriate for low-value repetitive tasks.” Augmentation, on the other hand, puts tools in the hands of experts who make decisions based on what the tools tell them. He and Applebaum agreed that the tools on the market now can help augment legal work – you just don’t want to rely on their output without verifying it. “These tools don’t replace lawyers. They augment them and help them be more efficient. You can get to a first draft faster – but output from AI will not be your final document.” Warren concurred: “These are tools, not independent entities,” he said.  For legal professionals just getting started with generative AI, Applebaum offered three main skills that will help them: Curiosity, prompting skills, and the ability to validate the responses. Watch the webcast to learn more about these skills. Risks and how to overcome them Privacy and hallucinations are two of the main risks associated with the tools that are widely available now.  Regarding privacy, it is sometimes the case that once you enter text – say, asking to summarize a document – the tool owns that content. It can learn from it or resurface it in other responses. This can cause real problems when you’re inputting your own work product or a client’s confidential information. Hallucinations are instances where the tool returns a plausible but completely made-up response, including made-up cases and facts.  To overcome both these risks, choose tools that guarantee the confidentiality of your data and that show you where their answers are coming from. Fletcher noted that instead of a typical “black box model” of AI, Thomson Reuters uses a retrieval augmented generator (RAG) that shows users where the answers come from, so they can validate them.   Thomson Reuters’ plans for generative AI in the legal industryApplebaum is certain the legal industry will adopt generative AI tools. “No lawyer types documents on a typewriter, and most of us carry previously unimaginable computing power in our pockets,” she said. She also noted that workers from Gen Z will expect the tools they use in their personal lives to be available professionally. They believe that AI will increase the value of their skills. Generative AI will certainly help legal professionals work more efficiently and with even more confidence. What will it mean for job security? There’s good news, Fletcher said: “The people who embrace the change will get to focus on more interesting work.” The webcast “Making sense of the intersection between AI and legal professionals,” is available on-demand.Watch it here.   Facebook   Twitter   Linkedin   Email Artificial IntelligenceInnovationLegal Topics",http://schema.org,Organization,"[{'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'contactType': 'Call Us', 'telephone': '+1 646 540 3000', 'name': 'Call Us - United States', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint'}, {'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+1 647 480 7000', 'name': 'Call Us - Canada', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint1'}, {'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+44 20 3197 3000', 'name': 'Call Us - United Kingdom', '@id': 'http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem#ContactPoint2'}]","['https://www.youtube.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/thomson-reuters', 'https://twitter.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.facebook.com/thomsonreuters', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/ThomsonReutersLegal']",https://cdn.cookielaw.org/logos/dbf5ae8a-0a6a-4f4b-b527-7f94d0de6bbc/a08ca288-4428-47cc-857d-186e117c6b89/b1045116-2c1f-45a6-8366-a1c4a4118e2c/2021-site-brand-update-logos_PNG_tr_h_lg_rgb_ps.png,https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1141267,1-888-728-7677,https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en/products,Thomson Reuters Legal,"['Legal research & guidance', 'https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12042875', 'http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6517578']",http://schemaapp.com/db/ThomsonReuters_SharedDataItem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This article is part of WorkLife’s special edition, which examines how the jobs and careers of Generation Z professionals will be reshaped and evolve in the AI-informed era. More from the series →
Generative-AI whiplash is fast becoming a standard response to the dizzying speed at which the technology is evolving. 
Its capabilities and flaws are puzzling leaders at schools and universities as many try to ban or regulate its use among students. Meanwhile companies are either embracing the tools and creating their own proprietary large language models (LLMs), or still evaluating how to best incorporate AI into their operations.
One cohort in particular is keen to experiment and learn exactly what these tools are capable of: Generation Z. Born between 1997 and 2012, this digital-first generation is open to harnessing the tools that will reshape how they perform their jobs over the course of their careers. 
Their openness however is stirring up an array of misconceptions. Here are some key myths about Gen Z workers and their use of generative AI in school, the workplace and their personal lives.
Myth: Gen Z workers are experts in AI and won’t need training

Gen Z workers are arguably more comfortable with the introduction of transformative new technology than those in other generations who grew up without advancements like smartphones and the internet. But that doesn’t mean Gen Zers know exactly how AI works. Many have interacted with predictive AI tools by way of personalized music and video recommendations, though their experience with newer generative AI tools is limited.
“It’s the start of a whole new era, a whole new ecosystem, and you cannot upfront be proficient with it,” said Alexey Korotich, vp of product at Wrike, a collaborative work management platform. “Additional skills are going to be required and people do not get those skills at birth,” he added.

Prompt engineering — the skill of knowing exactly what to put in ChatGPT and other generative AI tools to elicit the best, desired output which doesn’t sound generic — is seeing growing demand from employers, though it takes a decent amount of practice and time using the tools to truly understand and master. “Becoming AI experts will require extensive training,” said Jay Shankar, vp of global talent acquisition at Amazon Web Services.
Not only will Gen Zers need extensive training to master AI tools but they’ll also need to be taught in a way that’s tailored to them specifically and considers their unique experiences with technology. “Even though it may seem easy to use generative AI tools by entering a prompt and then getting a response, generative AI is a very sophisticated and complex technology,” Shankar said.
Best practices when it comes to prompt engineering — but even more so when it comes to responsible and ethical use of the tools — are paramount for Gen Z employees to fully grasp. 
“You need to understand the limitations of this technology, and you need to understand where it is helpful to use it, versus going to be actually misleading or harmful,” Korotich said. 
Harmful outputs are most often those that are inaccurate or biased – two key flaws with today’s AI tools. 
Myth: Gen Z workers aren’t reckless with AI
While Gen Z workers are more willing and eager to experiment with AI and learn exactly how it works, they still haven’t had enough professional experience to understand the implications of using it in a work setting. 
One major generational difference already posing a problem when it comes to AI is differing attitudes toward sharing information online or through other public channels. Younger workers who grew up with social media and few protections around their online privacy are accustomed to accepting cookies and typing in their birthdates to enter a web page — much unlike those in Generation X, or Baby Boomers.
They’re equally open to sharing information with LLMs like ChatGPT — including private company information.







            “We have worked with many organizations where people have taken Excel spreadsheets, uploaded them to public chatGPT to get something done, and have exposed companies data in that manner. And almost always, it's been Gen Z's that have been there and done that.""

“We have worked with many organizations where people have taken Excel spreadsheets, uploaded them to public ChatGPT to get something done, and have exposed companies’ data in that manner,” said Jason Averbook, a senior partner and global leader of digital HR strategy at consulting firm Mercer. “And almost always, it’s been Gen Zs that have been there and done that,” Averbook added.
Their limited professional experience means they also have limited knowledge around safeguarding enterprise data, he said. “Gen Z needs to understand the ethics and governance that goes into generative AI in organizations before they just start using it the same way they would use it when they’re writing their thesis paper or things like that,” he said.
Myth: AI will make Gen Z workers lazy
A major myth about generative AI is that it encourages laziness, and in schools, that it’s a form of cheating. And laziness is an attribute Gen Z often gets labeled with (headlines range from it being a generation of quiet quitters, to fans of “Lazy Girl” jobs and bare minimum Mondays). 
But when it comes to AI, so-called laziness may result in higher efficiency. “Laziness is not necessarily a bad thing — it actually provokes the search for the tools that can do your job more effectively,” Korotich said.
The prevailing theme from experts is that AI will take over more mundane tasks and allow workers to perform more satisfying, engaging and higher-level work. AI tools currently are also helpful as a copilot or mentor for younger workers looking for a sounding board or expert to answer questions through tools like ChatGPT. 
“AI is not meant to do the work for you, but it’s there to help you save a ton of time on various tasks,” said Oliver Pour, an account executive at Luminance, an AI software for those in the legal field. 
And a human teamed up with AI can do much more than a human on their own. “This is not a new idea, a human plus the internet could do a lot more than just a human without the internet,” said Graham Glass, founder and CEO of Cypher Learning, an AI-powered platform designed to help educators generate curriculum and learning materials.







            “If you're in a good work environment, they're not going to allow you to be lazy because they're going to expect more.""

Accordingly, the way we perform most jobs will change as the assumption they’re being done with AI becomes more commonplace. “If you’re in a good work environment, they’re not going to allow you to be lazy because they’re going to expect more,” said Glass.
Myth: AI will replace Gen Z workers
Gen Z isn’t the first generation expected to be replaced by new technology. Jobs have been made obsolete by technological innovation for more than a century. The introduction of computers led many to fear their jobs would become defunct. But computers, the internet, email, and other innovations “were built to improve our productivity, and generative AI has the potential to follow suit,” Shankar said. 
Accordingly, AI is expected to widely augment the way everyone does their jobs in the future. 
Many of the jobs that generative AI assists with are administrative. As such, tasks that would typically always have been assigned to a junior in a desk-based workplace, are now at risk of being carried out within minutes, rather than days, by AI tools as older workers realize they can get faster results this way. But that doesn’t mean Gen Z workers will be replaced, simply that their roles will evolve. 
Plus, all jobs are at risk of generative-AI driven change, not just Gen Z’s, according to an Indeed analysis of skills listed in over 55 million job postings. About 20% of jobs face high levels of potential exposure, and the higher the odds are that a job can be done remotely, the greater its potential exposure is, that report found.
“Some jobs are not necessarily going to be replaced, they’re going to be augmented, they’re going to be adapted to these new technologies so that people will continue to do the job but focus on the things where they can drive value,” Korotich said. 
“It can be a threat in a way that it can replace what you do today,” Korotich said. “But it can also be a huge opportunity that can truly get your productivity, and your level of impact that you, as an individual bring, to the next level,” he said.

On Friday, Professor Scott Galloway released ProfG.ai, a “digital twin” trained on his writing and capable of answering questions in his voice.  
That’s just one of many experiments with different models on how generative AI can impact the future of work.  
A few weeks ago, BCG released the results of a fascinating Harvard-led study that researched how more than 750 BCG consultants worldwide use GPT-4.  
BCG found that generative AI adoption was a “double-edged sword.”  There was high variability depending on how generative AI was used by consultants and type of task.  In creative product innovation, GPT-4 boosted performance by an average of 40%.  In business problem solving, GPT-4 dropped performance by 23%.  
What’s more, consultants don’t appear to have a sense of when GPT-4 is helping or hurting.  As BCG put it:
“People seem to mistrust the technology in areas where it can contribute massive value and to trust it too much in areas where the technology isn’t competent.”
BCG also found a “creativity trap” even when consultants used GPT-4 for tasks that showed the greatest performance gains.  Despite individual improvement, collective creativity was lower.  The homogenous output of GPT-4 reduced “diversity of thought” by 41%. 
A bigger potential risk is what the lead Harvard researcher in the study, Fabrizio Dell’Acqua, described as “falling asleep at the wheel.”  He said that people using AI tend to “switch off their brains” and “outsource their judgement to AI.”  This could lead to atrophying skills: 70% of the BCG consultants in the study worried that using GPT-4 would “stifle their creative abilities over time.”  
As one BCG consultant put it:
“Like any technology, people can rely on it too much. GPS helped navigation immensely when it was first released, but today people can’t even drive without a GPS. As people rely on a technology too much, they lose abilities they once had.”
There are two emerging models to adopting generative AI at work: the Centaur and the Cyborg.  The Centaur model draws a clear line between human and machine work for different tasks.  The Cyborg model integrates human and machine tasks throughout.
It’s hard to believe it’s only been ten-and-a-half months since OpenAI released ChatGPT.  It will take time and experimentation to figure out the best ways for organizations to adapt.  
One of my favorite quotes from Scott Brinker holds true in this age of AI and the future of work:
“Technology changes exponentially; organizations change logarithmically.”
Here are a few related cartoons I’ve drawn over the years:

Are bigger language models always better?

  4 min read - As enterprises look to separate the hype from where AI can add true value, it’s unclear if increasingly larger language models will always lead to better business solutions.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
One-thirds of respondents to McKinsey’s survey said that their companies are using generative AI in at least one business function. More businesses are now looking to incorporate generative AI tools to reduce costs, optimize operations and find new revenue streams. The impact on job markets are inevitable.




Generative artificial intelligence is changing the business world. More businesses are now looking to incorporate generative AI tools to reduce costs, optimize operations, as well as find new revenue streams.
The growing popularity comes less than a year since the majority of generative AI tools, including text generator ChatGPT and image creator Midjourney, were introduced in 2022.
Generative AI is artificial intelligence technology that enables users to generate texts, images, sounds, animations, and other types of data based on a variety of inputs.
According to a 2023 survey by consulting firm McKinsey, one-third of survey respondents said their companies are using generative AI (GAI) in at least one business function.
There is so much hype around AI technology that 40% of the survey respondents said that their companies will increase their investments in overall AI.
Technology heavyweights like Google, Adobe, and Meta have released several GAI tools in the past year. Google has incorporated the technology to help users write emails and edit photos. Adobe launched image-generating tools to compete with front runners such as Midjourney. Meta rolled out a generative AI tool to help advertisers to generate several versions of their advertisements.Advertisements




Google CEO Sundar Pichai is so convinced about the AI revolution that he said that “AI will be the biggest technological shift we see in our lifetimes” and spoke of Google pivoting to an “AI-first company.”
Key Takeaways


The 2023 generative AI survey by McKinsey found that one-third of respondents stated that their companies are using generative AI in at least one business function.
40% of survey respondents said that their companies plan to increase their investments in overall AI.
Generative AI is expected to automate 60 to 70 percent of work activities, according to McKinsey, although this doesn’t necessarily mean the automation of entire job roles.
The service operations sector is expected to be the most impacted by the growth of generative AI, potentially leading to a decrease in the workforce in customer care and back-office support.


Are Jobs Safe From Generative AI?
Let’s talk about a worrying theme that everyone associates with the growth of AI: job losses.
Which industries are the most vulnerable to AI-related job losses, and which job markets will come out relatively unscathed?
Most Impacted
According to McKinsey, the emergence of generative AI is expected to automate 60 to 70 percent of work activities. However, the consulting firm said that “this doesn’t necessarily translate into the automation of an entire role.”
Jobs in the service operations sector is expected to be the one most affected by the growth of generative AI. The world will likely see a decrease in workforce in customer care and back-office support as humans are replaced by AI.
McKinsey’s survey revealed that marketing, sales, product development, and software engineering are the most likely to use generative AI tools. Thus, job markets in technology and financial services sectors are expected to see disruptive change from gen AI.
“Industries relying most heavily on knowledge work are likely to see more disruption—and potentially reap more value,” said McKinsey.
Least Impacted
Job markets in manufacturing-based industries such as aerospace, automotives, and advanced electronics are expected to be least impacted by the emergence of GAI.
“This stands in contrast to the impact of previous technology waves that affected manufacturing the most and is due to gen AI’s strengths in language-based activities, as opposed to those requiring physical labor,” wrote McKinsey.
Generative AI Use Cases in The Office
Here are the most popular use cases of GAI, according to 1,684 participants from different regions, industries, companies, and specialties surveyed by McKinsey:

Crafting first drafts of text documents
Personalized marketing
Summarizing text documents
Identifying trends in customer needs
Drafting technical documents
Creating new product designs
Use of chatbots for customer service
Forecasting service trends
Business opportunities in generative AI

Corporations see AI technology as the biggest disruption to come since the internet. Many are using AI to cut costs, while front runners are looking to create new markets to reap rewards from.
McKinsey’s survey showed that only 23 percent of respondent said AI contribute to at least 5 percent of their company’s earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). The data suggests that AI technology is still in its early innings and has enormous room to capture value.
Companies that are leading the AI revolution are playing the long game and are prioritizing the creation of new revenue sources over cost reduction. McKinsey refers to them as “AI high performers.”
These companies are creating new AI-based products, revamping existing products with AI capabilities, using AI in product development, supply chain management, product-development-cycle optimization, and human resource performance management.
“We continue to see a set of AI high performers that are building out the foundations and capabilities that allow them to generate value.
One way to interpret this is that “the rich are getting richer” when it comes to extracting value from AI. We’ll be interested in seeing whether the great interest in generative AI opens the door to higher overall adoption of AI going forward,” said Michael Chui, Partner at McKinsey Global Institute.
Risks Related to Generative AI
Inaccuracy was the most cited risk among survey respondents with regards to generative AI adoption. Cybersecurity risks and intellectual property infringement were among the top three risks.
McKinsey’s survey also indicated that most companies were not fully prepared to deal with risks related to GAI adoption. Only 21 percent of respondents said that their companies had established policies that govern an employee’s use of GAI at work.
While less than 40% said their organizations were actively working to mitigate risks related to inaccuracy, cybersecurity, and intellectual property infringement arising from generative AI.
In order to unlock the full potential of generative AI technology, there is a rising need for companies to place governance and operating model for AI use, learn how to best manage third parties, and find balance between short-term gains and long-term growth.
“The real trap, however, is that companies look at the risk too narrowly. There is a significant range of risks—social, humanitarian, sustainability—that companies need to pay attention to as well. In fact, the unintended consequences of generative AI are more likely to create issues for the world than the doomsday scenarios that some people espouse,” said Alexander Sukharevsky, Senior partner and global leader of QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey.
The Bottom Line
The wave of generative AI is a transformative force with vast potential for businesses, but it also presents challenges.
As industries increasingly adopt these technologies, it is essential to strike a balance between automation and human expertise, ensure ethical use, and prioritize ongoing education and reskilling to harness the full potential of generative AI while mitigating its drawbacks.

McKinsey’s recent findings suggest that by 2030, 30% of tasks across the U.S. economy might be automated, up from 21% before generative AI. But what does this mean for those senior professionals who have dedicated decades to developing skills in a specific field? A study from the impact of AI on the future of workforces in the European Union and U.S. explains that older workers are most exposed to AI, because AI performs tasks that belong to those jobs involving high levels of education and accumulated experience. This technology is promising but potentially intimidating, especially to those who have yet to work immersed in technology. But senior professionals without tech skills can still navigate and excel in this AI-driven world. AI isn’t here to replace but to augment.

A study from the impact of AI on the future of workforces in the European Union and U.S. explains that older workers are most exposed to AI, because AI performs tasks that belong to those jobs involving high levels of education and accumulated experience. This technology is promising but potentially intimidating, especially to those who have yet to work immersed in technology. But senior professionals without tech skills can still navigate and excel in this AI-driven world. AI isn’t here to replace but to augment. You can use it to leverage your expertise, gain deeper insights, and offer a unique perspective that only years of experience can bring. AI might be powerful, but it cannot replicate or truly understand all the experience you have gained over years of firsthand encounters and interactions.",N/A,Age and generational issues,N/A,N/A,https://schema.org,WebSite,,,,https://hbr.org/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://hbr.org/search?term={search_term_string}', 'query-input': 'required name=search_term_string'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The US Space Force has decided that generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT) and large-language models can't be used by employees of the space service.As Bloomberg reports, an internal memo written by by Dr. Lisa A. Costa, first permanent Chief Technology and Innovation Officer of the US Space Force, was sent to the ""Guardian Workforce"" on Sept. 29. The memo explains how a temporary ban is now in place on such tools and until further notice. A spokesperson for Space Force referred to it as a ""strategic pause."" As to why a ban is required, Costa points to concerns over cybersecurity, data handling, and procurement requirements within the space service when relying on external/web-based AI tools. The ban is temporary because Costa admits generative AI ""will undoubtedly revolutionize our workforce and enhance Guardian’s ability to operate at speed,"" but needs to be used responsibly. That suggests some kind of phased introduction with strict rules around the use of AI tools is required, and that's going to take time to plan and implement. However, it's an unusual decision when you consider at least 500 people at Space Force were using Ask Sage, which is a ""secure and extensible"" GPT platform catering to government and corporate teams created by former US Air Force chief software engineer Nicolas Chaillan.

If we want to achieve the net zero target by 2050, we need to transform our economy into one that works in tandem with the principle of sustainability. Fortunately, we can already see glimpses of these transformations in our global economy.

The green transition alone is estimated to create 30 million jobs in clean energy, efficiency, and low-emission technologies by 2030. If you look at the top ten fastest-growing roles on Linkedin over the last four years, they include jobs you might not have even heard of before - sustainability analysts, sustainability managers, power engineers, and so on.

Artificial Intelligence and Climate Battle

There are already many ways in which experts have imagined the role that artificial intelligence can play in our climate battle in the form of AI Innovations.&nbsp;

Transport management: The potential for AI in the mobility sector is almost limitless, ranging from changing traffic flow based on particulate matter emissions to making the public transport system more robust and efficient - thereby reducing the amount of carbon emissions.

Energy consumption regulation: AI predictions can help in grid management and smartly regulate energy consumption inside homes, offices and even SMEs by using smart metres that can make vital and real-time decisions based on the needs of the space.

Agriculture and smart food management: AI can also be used to upskill our workforce working in the food systems. Farmers can be skilled to help provide a path towards a more sustainable farming practice. Using drones or even smartphone and images captured, AI can help to monitor and measure crop and soil health. Farmers could be taught how to create an automated water distribution system, access soil health, and even predict weather changes in real&ndash;time and give information so that farmers can act accordingly.

Climate change: The United Nations Environment Programme is already using AI to analyse complex datasets to accurately predict carbon concentration in the atmosphere, monitor glaciers, and measure sea level rises.

The new reality: The combination of AI along with Metaverse can actually render the virtual realm as a more immersive and engaging reality. Can you imagine how much we could reduce our carbon emissions if leaders and executives around the world didn&rsquo;t have to travel for every conference? It is estimated that transitioning from in-person to virtual conferencing can actually reduce our carbon footprint by 94 per cent and energy use by 90 per cent.

But, these are just the most logistical and immediate ways in which the forces of AI are going to empower us for the climate battle. What about the workforce that is going to create these green solutions,&nbsp; and run these green technologies.

If we want the green economy to truly thrive, then sustainability needs to be taught horizontally across all subjects and professions as a core principle.

Our green workforce cannot just become an added layer of expertise, but a foundation that cuts across every single worker. We need energy-conscious engineers, environmental lawyers and eco-friendly businessmen. And for too long, our education system has been struggling to inculcate a more personalised learning journey.&nbsp;

Personalised learning paths: AI can be used to create and deploy personalised learning paths to impart green skills in a more effective manner. Its ability to collect, analyse, and learn from vast amounts of data allows AI-powered educational platforms to create highly personalised learning paths for each learner.

Simulation models: Not only can sustainability be taught in a more fun and immersive manner, but by using both immersive learning technologies like AR/VR and AI, simulation training models can train workers on how to assemble a windmill or repair a solar panel or even give a shop floor experience of servicing or repairing electric cars. Learners can get hands-on experience and build newer skills even when they&rsquo;re just sitting in their classrooms. And even our manufacturing workforce can be trained to use better machinery through simulation models.

Language and location agnostic: What&rsquo;s perhaps most crucial in a context like India is that these learning models can easily be deployed in any language and any location with minimal infrastructure cost and travel.

Despite all its promises, AI cannot solve the climate crisis in isolation. We have to think of it as one of the many tools in our arsenal of weapons in this battle against climate change, and deploy it thoughtfully. What we also need to do is develop a highly skilled green workforce to fuel the green economy. At this moment, India has the potential to become the global green hub if we can effectively upskill our workforce into a green workforce.

Webinars 



















On September 6, 2023, the NGA Center for Best Practices hosted a virtual event, “Introduction to Artificial Intelligence in State Government,” co-organized with the Center for Scientific Evidence in Public Issues at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS EPI Center).
The event aimed to provide state leaders with foundational knowledge about AI technologies and applications in state government. National experts and state leaders discussed both the potential and risks of AI applications and policies to help ensure its responsible use in the public sector.
The Latest In Washington, D.C., On AI


Sean Gallagher, Deputy Director for Government Affairs at AAAS, provided an overview of what the federal government and Congress are doing to regulate and oversee this technology. To date, there are no overarching federal regulations on the responsible development and use of AI. In practice, states are leading the way on new AI guidance. Much of the current focus at the federal level is about the impact of AI on jobs and the economy, equity in AI and maintaining the U.S.’s competitive edge.


In practice, states are leading the way on new AI guidance.


Gallagher described these recent federal-level activities:

White House: In October 2022, the White House released a Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights around principles that people should be able to expect from automated systems such as requiring entities to disclose when they use AI, giving individuals the ability to opt out, putting into place legal protections where the use of AI may cause someone harm, and ensuring individuals have agency over how their data is used and how it may affect equity.
Commerce/NIST: The U.S. Commerce Department’s National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) influences and sets standards for AI use in the federal government. In 2019, NIST issued the first tools for mitigating bias. In January 2023, the agency released a voluntary AI Risk Management Framework with a focus on governance and consideration of the entire AI life cycle when measuring, mapping and managing risks.
FTC, CFPB, DOJ, EEOC: In April 2023, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), U.S. Department of Justice’s (DOJ) Civil Rights Division and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) jointly issued a statement on enforcement efforts against discrimination and bias in automated systems. In 2023, the FTC began new investigations into inaccuracies stemming from the use of generative AI.
Congress: U.S. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer of New York is leading a bipartisan effort called the Safe Innovation Framework for AI with three other senators. First announced in June 2023, the bipartisan AI framework has five themes for AI legislation: safety, innovation, accountability, alignment with democratic values, and transparency.

Gallagher noted that AI is getting a lot of attention on Capitol Hill now, with many legislative efforts focused on AI. To date, AI has not fallen neatly along partisan lines. AI will be a cross-jurisdictional issue because it affects everything from healthcare to transportation and education.

Why Generative AI has Grabbed the World’s Attention Since Late 2022
Ellie Pavlick, Brown University Assistant Professor of Computer Science & Linguistics, compared traditional AI with generative AI. Professor Pavlick noted that we’ve been using AI systems in different capacities, such as predicting the weather, for the past several decades. Traditional AI models were often based on tabular data that was understood and yielded “yes or no” type outputs and predictions, such as answers to questions about whether it might rain or not. AI models of all types have received more attention recently as they’ve been used in high-impact applications such as hiring.


Pavlick noted generative AI is a new type of AI with open-ended outputs that aren’t yes or no decisions, and that they work like neural networks that learn associations such as common word pairs for a vocal language model. The model is first trained to predict the next word in a sentence and then sequences of words through a Google-like search of the Internet.


Now is a good time to begin using and understanding the technology within safe or “sandboxed” domains so we are ready to adapt quickly in response to progress.


She noted three major risks with generative AI: “hallucination,” thwarted technical guardrails and bias:

Hallucination: Generative AI models don’t know what they don’t know, so they may make up answers, whether true or not, when they do not have access to a database to ground the model in reality. For example, when Pavlik asked a generative AI system to create a biography of her, it made up awards she had never received. This is referred to as “hallucination.”
Technical issues: OpenAI and Google have worked to prevent generative AI models from, for example, generating false news stories or giving instructions on how to make a bomb. However, AI researchers have shown that it is easy to bypass technical guardrails through the same guess-and-check methods used by legitimate AI researchers.
Bias: With both traditional and generative AI, the relationship between inputs and outputs results from a statistical algorithm which is subject to unfair bias and other risks. Generative AI models, however, work in an unstructured way. The inputs are essentially a black box (pulled from the world wide web), and the associations that are made by the AI model can be hard to inspect. Compared to traditional AI, which benefits from decades of research, generative AI is too new to have recommended solutions to bias yet. As an example, Pavlick noted generative AI will most likely display pictures of white males when asked to create or display a picture of a surgeon.

She noted that large language models and generative AI, in general, open up exciting possibilities, but currently there are more questions than answers. Over the next 3-5 years we will likely see rapid advances in our understanding of the risk landscape.
While AI has enormous potential to make predictions or to help with decision-making and automating routine tasks, its risks should be weighed carefully. She told the audience that now is a good time to begin using and understanding the technology within safe or “sandboxed” domains so we are ready to adapt quickly in response to progress.

How States are Using AI
State speakers at the event included:

Washington Chief Technology Officer Nick Stowe
Ohio Chief Information Officer & Assistant Director of the Administrative Services Department Katrina Flory
Utah Chief Information Officer, Department of Technology Services Alan Fuller

The state speakers discussed ways their states are using AI to increase productivity and efficiencies creatively. They shared examples of AI use in everything from fraud detection to chat bots to identifying cattle brands. States are also implementing policies and related activities to explore the risks of AI, putting out guidelines on the uses of generative AI by government staff, standing up advisory committees and study centers, and implementing procurement guides based on principles of responsible and safe AI use. In addition, they addressed their challenges and concerns about working with AI at this time.
You can watch each of the state speakers’ presentations at this link, or below. A summary of key points made by each state are presented here:

Washington state is applying computer vision and pattern recognition for detecting and preventing wildfires. The state is also using generative AI for software code development through an application called Copilot; since it’s a relatively new application for the state, they are taking a cautious and purposeful approach. In terms of AI policies, the state is applying its existing privacy principles. The Washington state privacy officer co-chairs the state AI committee. Washington published interim guidelines for the responsible use of generative AI in state government. Washington also developed procurement guidelines (heavily drawn from the NIST Risk Management Framework) to ensure new AI tools are aligned with state principles.
The state of Ohio is using AI for chat bots on the state website, OHIO.gov, and for predicting fraud in unemployment insurance. InnovateOhio, an organization founded by Lieutenant Governor Jon Husted, led recent AI Forums in Cincinnati, Cleveland and Columbus that focused on using AI as a tool for productivity, education, customer service and quality of life. All three forums reached capacity within hours of being announced. The Lieutenant Governor assembled AI thought leaders from the education, business and technology fields to help lead the discussions. Attendees included K-12, higher education and workforce development professionals, technology and business leaders, and state and local elected officials.
Utah is using AI for threat detection in cybersecurity. Its Department of Agriculture is using AI to identify livestock brands using computer vision, saving significant time from the prior manual process. The state is currently drafting a policy on the use of generative AI, which generally encourages its use but advises caution. The state also created a Center of Excellence in AI. Utah is taking an enterprise approach to AI where any AI use is taking place within the state’s internal enterprise system, not on the open web. This allows the state to make sure that any data entered via a prompt won’t be made public, helping to ensure quality outputs from any AI models.


State AI Resources
The NGA Center for Best Practices has compiled a state resource list on artificial intelligence that currently provides links to federal-level activities, state executive branch activities, state legislative actions, local-level activities, and resources for technical assistance. As additional items are identified, the resource list will be expanded.
Governors’ offices and other policy experts and stakeholders are encouraged to contact NGA to share input on the resource list or offer suggestions of specific AI topics the NGA Center and the AAAS EPI Center can address in future events. NGA’s intended audience includes Governors’ advisors and staff, state policymakers and executive leaders, state procurement officials, state chief information and technology officers, state offices that oversee automated systems such as public benefits distribution, government hiring, fraud detection or other systems.
The AAAS EPI Center also has AI resources to share on the EPI Center website which includes, for example, Foundational Issues in AI and Glossary of AI Terms and other useful resources.

AI chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT are based on large language models that are fed a lot of information.
They're also trained by humans who guide the system to spit out appropriate and accurate responses.
Computer science experts explained to Insider how the bots determine what to say next.

ChatGPT and other chatbots driven by artificial intelligence can speak in fluent, grammatically sound sentences that may even have a natural rhythm to them.But don't be lulled into mistaking that well-executed speech for thought, emotion, or even intent, experts say. A chatbot is, in essence, no more than a machine performing mathematical calculations and statistical analysis to call up the right words and sentences. Bots like ChatGPT are trained on large amounts of text, which allows them to interact with human users in a natural way. There's also a lot of training done by humans, who help smooth out any wrinkles.OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, says on its website that its models are instructed on information from a range of sources, including from its users and material it has licensed.

Here's how AI chatbots workAI chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT are based on large language models, or LLMs, which are programs trained on volumes of text obtained from published writing and information online, which is generally produced by humans. The systems are trained on series of words and learn the importance of words in those series, experts said. So all of that imbibed knowledge not only trains large language models on factual information, but it helps them divine patterns of speech and how words are typically used and grouped together. Chatbots are further trained by humans on how to provide appropriate responses and limit harmful messages. One AI data trainer who works at Invisible Technologies, a company contracted to train ChatGPT, previously told Insider they are tasked with identifying factual inaccuracies; spelling and grammar errors; and harassment when testing the chatbot's responses.

""You can say, 'This is toxic, this is too political, this is opinion,' and frame it not to generate those things,"" said Kristian Hammond, a computer science professor at Northwestern University. Hammond is also the director of the university's Center for Advancing Safety of Machine Intelligence.When you ask a chatbot to answer a simple factual question, the recall process can be straightforward: It is deploying a set of algorithms to choose the most likely sentence to respond with. It selects the best possible responses within milliseconds, and of those top choices, presents one at random. That's why asking the same question repeatedly can generate slightly different answers.Chatbots can also break down questions into multiple parts and answer each part in sequence, as if thinking through the question.Say you asked the bot to name a US president who shares the first name of the male lead actor of the movie ""Camelot."" The bot might answer first that the actor in question is Richard Harris. It will then use that answer to give you Richard Nixon as the answer to your original question, Hammond said.

Chatbots aren't perfect — and they can get stuff wrongAI chatbots run into the most trouble when asked questions they don't have the answer to. They simply don't know what they don't know, so instead of refusing to answer, they extrapolate, based on what they do know, and make a guess. The issue is that they don't tell you they're guessing — they may simply present information as fact. When a chatbot invents information that it presents to a user as factual, it's called a ""hallucination.""The possibility of ChatGPT spitting out a hallucination is, in part, why some tech experts warn chatbot users to be careful. In a recent Boston Consulting Group study, researchers found that people using ChatGPT at work can actually perform worse on certain tasks if they take the chatbot's outputs at face value and don't screen them for errors.""This is what we call knowledge of knowledge or metacognition,"" said William Wang, an associate professor teaching computer science at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He's also a co-director of the university's natural language processing group.

""The model doesn't really understand the known unknowns very well,"" he said.

Bots like ChatGPT are trained on large amounts of text, which allows them to interact with human users in a natural way. There's also a lot of training done by humans, who help smooth out any wrinkles.OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, says on its website that its models are instructed on information from a range of sources, including from its users and material it has licensed. AI chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT are based on large language models, or LLMs, which are programs trained on volumes of text obtained from published writing and information online, which is generally produced by humans. The systems are trained on series of words and learn the importance of words in those series, experts said. So all of that imbibed knowledge not only trains large language models on factual information, but it helps them divine patterns of speech and how words are typically used and grouped together. Chatbots are further trained by humans on how to provide appropriate responses and limit harmful messages. One AI data trainer who works at Invisible Technologies, a company contracted to train ChatGPT, previously told Insider they are tasked with identifying factual inaccuracies; spelling and grammar errors; and harassment when testing the chatbot's responses.""You can say, 'This is toxic, this is too political, this is opinion,' and frame it not to generate those things,"" said Kristian Hammond, a computer science professor at Northwestern University. Hammond is also the director of the university's Center for Advancing Safety of Machine Intelligence.When you ask a chatbot to answer a simple factual question, the recall process can be straightforward: It is deploying a set of algorithms to choose the most likely sentence to respond with. It selects the best possible responses within milliseconds, and of those top choices, presents one at random. That's why asking the same question repeatedly can generate slightly different answers.Chatbots can also break down questions into multiple parts and answer each part in sequence, as if thinking through the question.Say you asked the bot to name a US president who shares the first name of the male lead actor of the movie ""Camelot."" The bot might answer first that the actor in question is Richard Harris. It will then use that answer to give you Richard Nixon as the answer to your original question, Hammond said. AI chatbots run into the most trouble when asked questions they don't have the answer to. They simply don't know what they don't know, so instead of refusing to answer, they extrapolate, based on what they do know, and make a guess. The issue is that they don't tell you they're guessing — they may simply present information as fact. When a chatbot invents information that it presents to a user as factual, it's called a ""hallucination.""The possibility of ChatGPT spitting out a hallucination is, in part, why some tech experts warn chatbot users to be careful. In a recent Boston Consulting Group study, researchers found that people using ChatGPT at work can actually perform worse on certain tasks if they take the chatbot's outputs at face value and don't screen them for errors.""This is what we call knowledge of knowledge or metacognition,"" said William Wang, an associate professor teaching computer science at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He's also a co-director of the university's natural language processing group. ""The model doesn't really understand the known unknowns very well,"" he said.",,,,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/', 'name': 'Business Insider'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/artificial-intelligence', 'name': 'AI'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/how-ai-chatbots-like-chatgpt-work-explainer-2023-7', 'name': ""How do AI chatbots like ChatGPT work?

However, experts who have researched GAI for decades advise people not to allow robots to take over before guardrails have been built through legislation and norms of use. It's possible that GAI won't result in job losses, but there's no denying that HR specialists who use it will be in more demand than those who don't. By June 2024, 58% of firms, according to Mercer, plan to implement GAI in HR. Although 76% believe it will increase efficiency, the strategy goes beyond simple cost-cutting.Using cues, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), a subset of artificial intelligence (AI), may produce text, images, and even music. It produces output by combining algorithms and deep learning models with patterns and data that it has been trained on. According to a recent WEF study, industry transformation, including using artificial intelligence and other text, picture, and speech processing technologies, will result in a 23% change in worldwide employment over the next five years.Utilising generative AI carries several risks, biases, and errors, and employees often lack the knowledge and abilities necessary to optimise the advantages and reduce the risks. In this article, let&rsquo;s explore the prospects and risks associated with the use of Generative AI in HR, and find out its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats through SWOT analysis.Saving time with GenAIWith its unmatched efficiency and accuracy, generative AI can automate regular HR processes like reviewing resumes, responding to frequently requested queries, and setting up interviews. This automation not only reduces the chance of human error, which improves the fairness and accuracy of these processes, but it also frees up HR experts' time.While it has the ability to save HR departments a lot of time by automating repetitive processes and helping with tasks like answering common employee questions, HR leaders must make sure they're embracing solutions that won't put their businesses at risk. Collecting and analysing vast amounts of employee data raises privacy concerns. Leaders should create ethical procurement guidelines for screening vendors and test any AI technology before implementing it. HR departments must navigate the delicate balance between collecting data for insights and respecting employees' privacy.Does GenAI put creativity at risk? With the ability to provide fresh ideas or solutions that humans would not have thought of, generative AI has the potential to stimulate creativity and innovation. Through the democratisation of information and creativity, GAI promotes creativity, innovation, and the ability to solve challenging problems. AI models can sometimes generate content that raises ethical questions. For example, they can generate essays, art, or music that closely resembles the work of human creators, potentially leading to intellectual property disputes. To mitigate these risks, it's essential to approach the use of generative AI with caution and ethical considerations. Could GenAI be a tool of misinformation?For better decision-making, generative AI is a powerful tool. It can produce actionable insights to help HR decision-makers make more informed choices by examining patterns and forecasting trends. A generative AI solution, for instance, may help identify which candidates are most likely to succeed in particular roles or flag workers who may be about to look for new possibilities.Gartner predicts that by 2027, 80% of business marketers will create a specific unit to handle content authenticity in order to counteract false information.In HR, for instance, this can imply that an AI system unintentionally spreads inaccurate or out-of-date information about a company's policies or job positions, causing a chain reaction of confusion and possibly serious legal issues.SWOT Analysis for aligning GenAI with human needs and limitationsWhile all the above aspects are common, it becomes crucial for every organisation to go through its own set of compliances, opportunities, and risks associated with GenAI implementation in HR.Conducting a SWOT Analysis will help you determine what are the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats associated with your GenAI software for your organisation&rsquo;s human resources:Here's a breakdown of a SWOT analysis for GenAI software:    AI software has significant strengths, such as automation, data processing, and predictive analytics, which can benefit various industries. However, it also faces challenges related to complexity, bias, and ethical concerns, as well as regulatory and security risks. Understanding the SWOT analysis of AI software is essential for organisations and individuals looking to harness its potential while mitigating its weaknesses and threats.In conclusion, the integration of generative AI into HR processes offers several advantages in terms of efficiency, personalisation, diversity, and data-driven decision-making. However, these benefits come with potential risks related to bias, privacy, job displacement, data security, and ethical considerations. HR professionals and organisations must carefully design, monitor, and regulate AI systems to maximise the benefits while mitigating the risks. The future of HR will likely involve a harmonious combination of AI and human expertise to create a more effective and equitable workplace.",,,,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@id': 'https://hrsea.economictimes.indiatimes.com', 'name': 'Home'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@id': 'https://hrsea.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news', 'name': 'News'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'item': {'@id': 'https://hrsea.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/industry', 'name': 'Industry'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 4, 'item': {'@id': 'https://hrsea.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/industry/generative-al-and-the-future-of-hr-prospects-and-risks/104444850', 'name': 'Generative Al and the future of HR: Prospects and risks'}}]",,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'Place', 'address': 'Times Internet Limited (Times Center), FC - 6, Sector 16 A, Film City, Noida - 201301 Uttar Pradesh, India'}",contactus@ethrworld.com

Court cases from comedian Sarah Silverman, a group of artists, Getty Images, and authors including John Grisham and George R.R. Martin, among others, allege generative artificial intelligence systems infringe on copyright by using copyrighted works without permission.“These systems can generate novel creative content in a wide variety of forms and even of quality comparable to works created by talented human artists,” said the consultation document released Thursday.Generative artificial intelligence like Open AI’s ChatGPT uses existing material to train the systems, which can produce text, audio or video in response to prompts. The rapid emergence of the technology in the past year has left governments grappling with how to regulate it, including in terms of copyright.Advertisement 3Story continues belowArticle contentOn one side are the rights holders and creators who want protections against the use of their works for training AI, and who are likely to urge the government to keep a human element to copyright authorship, the government outlined in an earlier document obtained through access to information. On the other, tech companies argue that using protected works to train AI systems isn’t an infringement of copyright, and are likely to support copyright protection for AI-generated content.The government indicated in the consultation it wants to balance the two perspectives. It said it wants to support innovation and investment in both AI and Canada’s creative industries.It’s seeking input on how copyright law should deal with the use of copyrighted material for training generative AI systems, as well as whether it should change the copyright and authorship regimes to account for AI-generated content. Comments are due Dec. 4.“AI can now create content that is difficult to distinguish from content created by human persons,” the consultation noted. “Over the years, AI systems’ capacity to independently generate works or other subject matter has increased and that is only expected to continue. There are now a number of AI applications that can write movie scripts, software, and music with little human input beyond the development of the AI itself.”The consultation paper outlined different options, including clarifying that copyright protection only applies to works created by humans, or attributing authorship to the person who set up the AI-generated work to be created, an approach that could “mean that AI-generated works receive similar copyright protection as works created by humans.”Our website is the place for the latest breaking news, exclusive scoops, longreads and provocative commentary.
