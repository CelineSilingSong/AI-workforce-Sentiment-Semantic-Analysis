Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have sparked renewed fears regarding the future of work. One widely discussed solution to this perceived problem is a universal basic income (UBI), provoking debates about the justice, efficiency and political feasibility of such an entitlement, whether such an income should be conditional, and how to ensure that it mitigates rather than exacerbates gender  as well as other inequalities. Leaving aside the question of whether AI will destroy more jobs than it creates, it is important to consider the future of work within the context of the broader struggle over the kind of political and economic settlement that will replace the neo-liberal consensus that has held sway since the 1980s. This model is currently in crisis, having entered what Abby Innes terms its ‘Brezhnevite’ phase of terminal decay, a notable symptom of which is the wave of right-wing nationalism sweeping the globe. If UBI policies are ever implemented they will likely form part of a wider settlement and encompass other transformations such as a green new deal. Since women’s interests are so often confined to the sidelines in such transformations, it is crucial to ensure that UBI proposals are developed using a gender lens.
Two prominent recent basic income proposals illustrate the frequent lack of such a perspective. Thomas Piketty’s Capital and Ideology offers an ambitious new analysis of the drivers of economic development, concluding with a section suggesting ‘elements for a participatory socialism’ – that is, his proposed route beyond the current crisis. In common with radical programmes of the twentieth century (for example, in revolutionary Russia and Germany in 1968), gender inequality and its implications for emancipatory politics are neglected in this analysis. Thus, Piketty’s discussion of the basic income and its potential contribution to securing a more just society does not examine the implications for the gender distribution of unpaid caring and household labour. Indeed, it does not mention gender at all. His basic income appears directed towards a genderless, universal citizen.
Meanwhile, Daniel Susskind’s detailed analysis of the consequences of A World Without Work argues that basic income should be conditional. Susskind displays more interest in gender than Piketty. He acknowledges, for example, that caring and household labour is largely performed on an unpaid basis, predominantly by women, with the combined value of cooking, childcare, laundry and other household chores performed in the UK annually estimated to be approximately £800 billion. Susskind stresses that such work, though crucial to society, is currently undervalued and that a conditional basic income (CBI) would provide “an opportunity to repair this mismatch.” But given that he devotes a whole book to analysing the issue, it is interesting that Susskind does not mention the potential of a basic income to challenge the gendered structures that leave women with the lion’s share of the currently unpaid burden of reproductive labour.
Nevertheless, Susskind’s idea of a conditional basic income does at least potentially address a key question that many analyses of the basic income ignore, that is, as Nancy Folbre asks, does the putative ‘Malibu surfer’ of UBI debates get the same income as the care-worn housewife? (Susskind’s implied answer is that the surfer would have to do some voluntary work as a condition of receiving income). Another solution is provided by Almaz Zelleke who argues that one way of compensating caring labour within the framework of a basic income would be to give it to children as well as adults, as occurs with the cash transfers from the Alaska Permanent Fund. This would provide additional income to those who provide childcare. This does not address all issues, such as the fact that disabled adults and children will likely require a higher level of income. Nevertheless, it highlights the kind of thinking required.
Yet, as is the case with Susskind, discussions of the UBI rarely engage with the potential of such income to challenge the resiliently gendered division of paid and unpaid labour. An exception is Kathy Week’s book The Problem of Work, a feminist analysis of ‘postwork imaginaries,’ which considers the potential of basic incomes to ‘de-centre’ paid work, as well as to disrupt the division of reproductive and productive work and its associated gendered strictures. That is, a basic income offers an opportunity to de-gender breadwinning, domestic labour and care giving by allowing individuals to organise paid work around their lives rather than vice versa. As Weeks stresses, however, such potential can only be realised if feminist perspectives are included in basic income debates.
Such a gendered approach is important for two reasons. First, as Nancy Fraser argues, the current crisis is multi-dimensional: it encompasses ecological, social and economic issues, including skyrocketing inequality. An often-overlooked element is the crisis of care resulting from a shift away from the male breadwinner model which relied on the unpaid caring labour of women. The rise in female employment has brought women vital gains such as economic independence and opportunities for personal development, but since there has been neither a gender redistribution of caring labour nor a socialisation of care work, it has created a ‘care gap’ that manifests itself in rising stress, as well as divisions between those who can afford to pay for care and those who cannot. As noted above, designed in the right way a basic income could begin to address this.
Second, in the current period of crisis gender politics are frequently ‘weaponised’ by right-wing nationalists who construct feminists as alien ‘others’ with interests antithetical to those of the ‘people,’ as if women were not part of that mythical body of homogenous citizens.  Such arguments have found resonance against a background of rising inequality and economic insecurity in which men in dominant ethnic groups fear a loss of status both within the labour market and in the domestic sphere where the challenge to male breadwinning threatens their primacy. Such politics has resulted in attempts to roll back women’s advances in particular through attacks on their reproductive rights. This highlights the need for any new settlement to develop gender solidarity by emphasising the potential gains for both men and women in eschewing constraining gender strictures. Again, a basic income could help to forge such solidarity, as part of a ‘gender new deal.’
Fear is currently trumping hope across much of the world.  It will not be easy to secure a change in political direction. The first step is to provide a positive and compelling vision of the future. It is therefore essential to develop the intellectual basis for a new settlement to address the pressing economic, ecological and social challenges of our troubled era. Debates about the basic income form part of that groundwork and must be informed by a gender perspective.

Machine learning (ML) and data science are often mentioned in the same breath – and for good reason. The two complement each other. However, understanding how they work – and work together – is important.
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that empowers computers to self-learn from data and apply that learning without human intervention. Data science, on the other hand, is the discipline of data cleansing, preparation, and analysis.

""At its core, data science is a field of practice and machine learning is a set of tools and methodologies.""
“At its core, data science is a field of practice and machine learning is a set of tools and methodologies,” says JP Baritugo, director at business transformation and outsourcing consultancy Pace Harmon. “Data science uses a broad array of expertise, business knowledge, tools, and methodologies to process big data to generate meaningful insights that drive actions and enable impactful business outcomes.”
Why machine learning demands data science
Effective ML demands good data science. “A data scientist’s expertise is absolutely required to ensure machine learning is used and deployed properly,” Baritugo says. The data scientist may ensure the model is provided with the requisite amount of cleaned and normalized datasets for training and that the right algorithms are used based on the datasets and the business question to be addressed.
""A data scientist’s expertise is absolutely required to ensure machine learning is used and deployed properly."" 
However, data science can be applied outside the realm of machine learning. “Data science is the practical application of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning – along with data preparation – in a business context,” says Ingo Mierswa, founder and president of data science platform RapidMiner.
“While the goal of data science is to extract insights from data, predict future developments, and suggest actions – sometimes even performing those actions automatically – this is achieved with tools like AI and ML,” Mierswa says.
At a basic level, a data scientist gathers and prepares data sets from multiple sources and then applies some capability to extract insight from them. In some cases, they may reach for machine learning. In others, a more basic analysis may make sense. “In my view at least, data science is just the manipulation of data,” says Wayne Butterfield, director of cognitive automation and innovation at ISG.
When to use machine learning
Machine learning excels at extracting data patterns.
When facing a situation in which a solution is hidden in a large volume of data, machine learning is your friend. “ML excels at processing that data, extracting patterns from it in a fraction the time a human would take, and producing otherwise inaccessible insight,” Mierswa says.
For example, machine learning (informed by data science) powers risk analysis, fraud detection, and portfolio management in financial services; GPS-based predictions in travel; and product and content recommendations for Amazon and Netflix.
Machine learning is best matched with problems for which large amounts of well labelled historical data already exist, or for which data can be simulated very quickly. “There isn’t much mileage in using ML if you don’t have enough existing data that it can train on,” says Butterfield.
ML models are only as good as the quality of the data they learn from. “Luckily, there are many types of problems for which lots of data exist,” says Timothy Havens, the William and Gloria Jackson Associate Professor of Computer Systems in the College of Computing at Michigan Technological University and director of the Institute of Computing and Cybersystems
“Certain problems lend themselves to ML very well,” Butterfield explains. Data science (minus machine learning) has been applied to forecasting and planning for years with limited accuracy, for example. “However, now because you can now build complex algorithms that can take into account multiple data sources – such as weather, historic sickness patterns, external events, past demand – you get a much more accurate forecast,” Butterfield says. “And this isn’t just on a daily basis, it can be hourly too.”
In financial services, machine learning and data science can power solutions for fraud prevention.
In financial services, ML and data science can power solutions for underwriting and fraud prevention. In IT, they can improve network management. Healthcare organizations can apply them to improve diagnostic accuracy, determine optimal price and volume mix, or predict patient outcomes. In customer experience management, they come together to improve customer interactions, predict customer lifetime value, and estimate churn. Retailers can tap them to forecast demand, optimize pricing, and segment customers. In manufacturing, data science and ML can be used to automate the supply chain and improve planning.
When data science is enough
With all the excitement around AI, every business problem can start to look like an opportunity to throw a little machine learning at it. However, there remain many instances in which ML may not work – or could be overkill.
Sometimes, data science is enough. “It is difficult to distinctly separate data science and ML since boundaries are blurry. At the end of the day, most of the algorithms use statistical techniques,” says Anil Vijayan, Vice President at Everest Group. “Not every problem requires AI to solve though. In many cases, using “traditional” data science may not just suffice, but also be more efficient.”

Traditional data science techniques (no ML required) may be more effective in scenarios in which the output is dependent on relatively few parameters, and those parameters do not change much over time, Vijayan says. In addition, when the relationship between the output and the parameters are well understood and not likely to shift, Vijayan adds, data science alone will suffice.

20 women doing fascinating work in AI, machine learning and data science


by Elaine Burke


9 Mar 2020 




Save article





Gender balance in AI conference line-ups has been noticeably poor. But women in AI exist and their work is multifaceted and extraordinary.
Artificial intelligence (AI) is the hot ticket in tech at the moment. Unfortunately, too many events and conferences delving into the subject, and its related disciplines of machine learning (ML) and data science, feature few women – if at all – among their speakers.
To prove it doesn’t have to be like this, and as a follow-on from International Women’s Day, we at Silicon Republic have found 20 terrific women in AI, ML and data science who we think should be turning up in speaker line-ups across the country (and around the world).

Alessandra Sala
Alessandra Sala is head of analytics research at Nokia Bell Labs and technology advisory board member at CeADAR, Ireland’s Centre for Applied AI. She’s also the chief ambassador of Women in AI Ireland.
Women in AI is a non-profit working towards gender-inclusive AI for the benefit of global society. The group’s most recent Dublin meet-up took place at Trinity Business School and posed challenging questions around ethically driven AI design.

— Gillian Armstrong (@virtualgill) January 24, 2020

A solutions architect with Liberty IT where she is helping to bring machine learning and serverless systems to the world of enterprise, Armstrong was recently named a global AWS Machine Learning Hero.
She is most excited by applied AI and exploring how software engineers and data scientists can work closer together with the right tools. She’s also passionate about ethical AI and human-centred design, and eagerly shares what she learns with others online and off.
Sarah Jarvis
Head of data science at Prowler, Sarah Jarvis was named among Re-Work’s 30 influential women advancing AI last year. She spoke last summer at CogX, the festival of AI and emerging technology, about building “a principled decision-based AI system” at the Cambridge-based company.

Prowler is building a platform that allows for complex decision-making in environments such as smart cities, logistics businesses and interconnected financial systems. Jarvis believes the future of tech-enabled decision-making will have to be instantaneous but also scalable and transmittable. She also believes there needs to be trust and, for that to happen, those who build AI need to be able to explain the how and why behind their tech’s decisions.
Jennifer Cruise
Head of data science at the Aon Centre for Innovation and Analytics in Dublin, Jennifer Cruise believes she’s in the “most exciting” industry for delving into data, and it’s true that insurance has deep roots in the history of analytics.

By the time you’re done reading this article, you’ll have a strong sense of clarity about the current and future applications of AI for online shopping. Before we begin exploring each company, we’ll present the common patterns that emerged throughout our research in this sector. Artificial Intelligence in eCommerce – Insights Up Front The most popular AI applications from the top four industry leaders currently using AI appear to be:  Chatbots/AI assistants: Responding to customer inquiries, responding to voice commands for simple tasks and providing product recommendations through interactions using natural language (see Alibaba and eBay below) Smart logistics: Machine learning algorithms are being applied to data to help automate warehouse operations. (see JD.com below). Recommendation engines: Companies are analyzing customer behavior on their websites and using algorithms to predict what products may appeal to customers and provide recommendations. (see Amazon below). In the full article below, we’ll explore the AI applications of each eCommerce firm individually. We will begin with Amazon, the #1 ranking eCommerce firm based on 2016 sales revenue. Amazon Machine learning – Recommendation Engine Alexa, which has become a household name, is one of Amazon’s more visible AI applications. However, one of the company’s most lucrative applications of AI is less apparent and more integral to its operations.  Machine learning drives the algorithms which are core to Amazon’s targeted marketing strategy, allowing the company to predict what products will most likely interest customers and to provide customized recommendations based on customer searches. It has been estimated that Amazon’s recommendation engine drives 35 percent of total sales.  Automation and Robotics – Amazon Robotics and Prime Air Automation also plays a central role in the evolution of the industry leader’s approach to warehouse operations. After Amazon’s estimated $775 million acquisition of warehouse robot manufacturer Kiva Systems, Inc (now Amazon Robotics) back in 2012, to date, the company has a reported 100,000 robots in operation across its warehouse locations worldwide. An emerging application is the company’s Prime Air delivery drones. The effort to improve delivery efficiency and reduce shipping cost is particularly relevant for the leading eCommerce firm. According the company’s 2016 annual report, from 2014 to 2016, Amazon’s net product shipping costs steadily increased from approximately $4.2 billion to $7.2 billion. Shipping costs are categorized under “cost of sales” which represented 70.5 percent and 64.9 percent of total operating expenses, in 2014 and 2016. In December 2016, Prime Air was launched in a private trail in the United Kingdom. Amazon claims the drone successfully delivered its first 5 lbs package within 30 minutes. It is estimated that Amazon once peaked at 26 million online item purchases in a single day.  The pilot started with just two customers and is expected gradually expand to more customers over time in other countries including the U.S. Current government restrictions on the use of drones may pose challenges to deploying Prime Air in the U.S. The company is reportedly in working with regulatory agencies both in the U.S. and other countries to expand Prime Air.    “At Amazon, we’ve been engaged in the practical application of machine learning for many years now. Some of this work is highly visible: our autonomous Prime Air delivery drones; the Amazon Go convenience store that uses machine vision to eliminate checkout lines; and Alexa, our cloud-based AI assistant. But much of what we do with machine learning happens beneath the surface. Machine learning drives our algorithms for demand forecasting, product search ranking, product and deals recommendations, merchandising placements, fraud detection, translations, and much more. Though less visible, much of the impact of machine learning will be of this type – quietly but meaningfully improving core operations.” – Jeff Bezos, Amazon CEO, Letter to Shareholders (2016) (For readers with a strong interest in drone applications, refer to our article on drone delivery, and our other article on commercial drone regulations.) Deep learning – Amazon Go Amazon Go is an emerging initiative which is part of the company’s heavier push into the grocery industry, evidenced by the estimated $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods Market. The company claims that it leverages deep learning combined with computer vision and sensor technologies to track “when products are taken from or returned to the shelves.” Products are tracked in a virtual cart and customers are charged via their Amazon accounts.  This process would eliminate the need for a traditional check-out system. Currently one Amazon Go store is in operation at Amazon’s headquarters in Seattle, Washington which opened in December 2016. However, an innovative initiative of this kind is not without its challenges.  In March 2017 it was reported that the system experienced technical difficulties processing and tracking payments for more than approximately 20 customers at one time. As Amazon works to improve its model, the ideal customer capacity for this technology may require a smaller store design and a certain number of human staff on site to monitor operations and provide tech support.   JD.com Automation and Robotics – Warehouse logistics In 2016, reports circulated that Beijing-based JD.com engaged in a strategic partnership with Siasun Robot & Automation Co Ltd. The purpose of the collaboration was to use automation technology, such as robots, to improve warehouse operations. Ideally, this system would improve the speed and efficiency of product sorting and delivery in warehouses, thereby cutting costs and ultimately increasing revenue.   As of May 2016, JD.com had reportedly established seven logistics centers responsible for operating 209 warehouses throughout China such as its automated logistics and warehouse complex in Gu’an China.  Reports claim that the number of online orders hit a total of 1.26 billion in 2015 (double the amount of orders in 2014) and approximately 85 percent of those orders were delivered within two days.  It is possible that the logistics centers improved the company’s capacity to process orders and product shipment speed, however, this was not specifically confirmed by the aforementioned reports.  In July 2017, Richard Liu, founder and CEO of Beijing-based JD.com, stated that AI is a necessary component of the company’s business strategy going forward. The company reportedly aims to use AI to reduce the number of JD.com employees from approximately 120,000 to 80,000 over a decade and significantly increase its profit margin. According to reports, November 2018 is the company’s target date for the debut of its “first unmanned warehouse” and AI and robots will be responsible for handling jobs related to “parcel sorting, packaging and categorization.” “Why must JD.com use AI and robots today? It is because we have exhausted all traditional technology and methods to improve retail costs and bring efficiency to its maximum potential. This is not because we like to follow a hot trend. This is our only choice to achieve another critical breakthrough in efficiency maximization.” – Richard Liu, CEO (July 2017) AI Assistant – LingLong DingDong Yeah that’s the legit name of the device. Legit. Moving on with the rest of the article now: While the product name may not allude to a bold statement at first glance, JD.com is looking to compete with Amazon Echo with its own home speaker technology. The LingLong DingDong, which essentially performs the same functions as the Echo, currently responds to natural language commands in Mandarin and Cantonese.  Priced at approximately $118 per unit JD.com offers its product at a reduced price point compared to the Echo which averages about $180 per unit. Below is a brief description of JD’s smart speaker, with some context on the Chinese smart speaker market:  Smart home technology in the Chinese market is projected to reach $28.8 billion by 2018. Alibaba AI assistants – Tmall Genie and Ali Assistant In June 2016, it was reported that Alibaba hired former Amazon senior principal scientist Ren Xiaofeng to lead its AI efforts. The move signals a concerted effort to enhance its competitive edge against the leading eCommerce firm. During his four years at Amazon, Xiaofeng states that he played an instrumental role in building the framework for Amazon Go.  The company’s efforts to compete with Amazon are also apparent in the launch of Tmall Genie, a very similar product to the Amazon Echo. The voice activated AI assistant debuted in July 2017 and is sold for less than its U.S. counterparts at 499 yuan (approximately $73.42).  Tmall Genie performs tasks, such as controlling smart-home devices, checking the weather or a user’s daily schedule. Currently the device is only available in China and is programmed to received commands in the Mandarin language. If Tmall Genie is successful, time will tell if and when Alibaba will attempt to expand its market reach beyond China. CNBC reported on Alibaba’s Amazon Echo competitor in July 2017:   Alibaba’s AI assistant technology also found in the Ali Assistant, a customer service chatbot that processes both written and spoken inquiries. The chatbot reportedly processes 95 percent of customer inquiries.  Machine learning – Recommendation engine Alibaba claims that AI algorithms are helping to drive internal and customer service operations including smart product and search recommendations: Alibaba’s software tracks customer browsing and interactions with the website to offer product recommendations. (For more insight on AI algorithms, read our full guide titled ‘Artificial Intelligence Algorithms and Their Business Applications’.) Machine learning – Smart logistics Through the company’s logistics affiliate Cainiao, AI is used to help map the most efficient delivery routes. Alibaba claims that smart logistics have resulted in a 10 percent reduction in vehicle use and a 30 percent reduction in travel distances. In March 2016, Alibaba invested 10 billion yuan (approximately $1.53 billion) in the Cainiao Network for roughly 47 percent equity interest in the company. eBay AI assistant – eBay Shopbot As a successful early competitor in the field of eCommerce, the company is looking to use AI to maintain consumer interest and a competitive edge. The eBay Shopbot, a chatbot accessed through the Facebook messenger platform was first piloted in October 2016.  The bot functions as an AI assistant to help users easily find products of interest using natural language. Users can communicate with the bot via text, voice or using pictures taken with their smartphone of images related to a particular product. A screen shot of eBay’s ShopBot – Source: ebayinc.com There is a lack of published evidence to substantiate whether the chatbot has proven to be a significant driver of revenue for the company. However, there is evidence to suggest that machine learning is an integral component of eBay’s business strategy.  “We apply machine learning techniques to item-to-product matching, price prediction and item categorization tasks on eBay. We also employ them for attribute extraction, generating the proper names of browse nodes, filtering product reviews and more. Machine learning helps us optimize the relevance of shoppers’ search and navigation experiences.” – Selcuk Kopru, eBay Research Scientist (August 2016) Two out of six of eBay’s acquisitions in 2016, Salespredict and Expertmaker, were companies with platforms built using AI.  “What AI is going to do is accelerate the pivot from simple clustering around inventory, to combining intelligence about individuals, behaviors, trends, and context…We recently acquired Expertmaker – a company that has created an advanced AI platform enabling optimization and automation. We currently expect to apply their technology across our platform, to help improve shipping and delivery times, trust, pricing, and more.” – Devin Wenig, eBay President and CEO, May 2016 Concluding Thoughts on Artificial Intelligence in eCommerce AI is emerging in the eCommerce segment of the retail industry and is being applied across multiple areas including processing customer service inquires, product packaging and delivery, and internal operations.  The economic impact of eCommerce must also be considered as some firms anticipate reducing their number of employees in favor of increased efficiency and cost savings. While a certain degree of job losses may be inevitable, research findings published in a 2017 report by the Progressive Policy Institute suggest that from 2007 to 2016 eCommerce produced 355,000 jobs while 51,000 jobs were lost in the general retail sector. Emerj’s research on the retail industry at-large has revealed an important trend that is also applicable in the eCommerce sector: Applications that have the highest likelihood of broader retail adoption are those that have a direct, hard-line return on investment. Therefore, smart logistics and recommendation engines are poised to continue to bring value to to companies investing in these technologies and are proving profitable for industry leaders such as Amazon.com. In Emerj’s interview with eBay’s chief data officer Zoher Karu, Karu suggests that small and mid-sized businesses should organize their data around their customers in order to gain real business value.  Karu posits that the majority of businesses typically organize data in other ways such as by region, country or channel. As a result this often leaves gaps in gaining a thorough understanding of the customer perspective. Examples of customer-centric data include customer type, highest value customers and customer purchasing frequency.  We will continue to monitor how the eCommerce sector evolves as we anticipate the field will continue to be impacted by AI over time.   Header image credit: HerCampus.com Related Posts Big Data Analytics in eCommerce - Data Platforms and Artificial IntelligenceDigitally-native eCommerce businesses are used to working with their customer data in order to write… Artificial Intelligence Initiatives at India’s Top IT Services FirmsTo stay competitive and relevant in the fast-changing world led by digital, India’s leading IT… Artificial Intelligence at the Top Medical Device CompaniesPredictive and prescriptive analytics seem to be the most common types of AI applications at… Artificial Intelligence at the Top 5 US Defense ContractorswikiMany of the pivotal technologies utilized by the public today have their roots in military… Artificial Intelligence at Wells Fargo - A Brief OverviewWells Fargo has begun a number of AI initiatives, some they've created in-house and some… Share to: LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Email Stay Ahead of the AI Curve Discover the critical AI trends and applications that separate winners from losers in the future of business.

Imagine you run a bakery. So you want to know every morning how much bread to bake. For this, you use historical data, which you collect before, like:Predicting by just date is hardly feasible, but you notice that your demand depends on:weather conditions (in cold or rainy weather, fewer people go outside for purchases)month (in summer, your customers go on holidays)day of the week (as you are closed on Sundays, people buy more before and after)some events in the neighbourhood (imagine your bakery is close to a football stadium)So you add columns with values for every day. You call the column you’re predicting the “target” and the columns you’re using for predictions the “features”.The questionSo you give your data to a guy who calls him/herself a data scientist and ask them to create something for predicting the demand — the data scientist calls this the “model”. You can imagine a model to be a decision tree which will be created by an algorithm using your data. After the model is delivered, you need to know if you can trust it (blindly) and use the predictions in your daily work.To answer this question, we focus on the methodical part and consider the model itself to be a black box. This should give guidance to QA, managers, developers and infrastructure people who need to ensure the quality of software which uses AI. I’m convinced that an understanding of QA and common sense are sufficient prerequisites for this if you learn the playbook of how AI models are developed. You don’t need to take additional classes in math, statistics or deep learning.I also want to provide ideas and best practices for data scientists, as they often have to ensure the quality of the data and models by themselves. Especially if your experience comes primarily from ML classes, research or Kaggle challenges, which cover only a part of the model lifecycle, you may be interested in additional QA techniques needed when working in the industry.AI model lifecycleFrom a lifecycle perspective, AI projects usually involve 3 stages:collecting and preparing datatraining the modeldeploying the model in production for making predictions, monitoring the modelThus, QA performs different checks or reviews depending on stage:Is the data which will be used for model training of sufficient quality? This is the topic of this blog post.Is the built model which goes live of sufficient quality? That will be the topic of the next post.Does the model keep delivering sufficient quality when running in production? I will deal with that in the last post in this series.Some QA steps come down to a check comparing a metric of your data or model to a predefined value or threshold. Others are rather analyses or reviews, requiring time, manual effort, domain knowledge and common sense.On automationThe chance that you won’t need to retrain your model once it is live, even if the approach and the tools stay the same, is close to zero. Apart from technological changes and new requirements, there are some reasons specific to AI:You are likely to get more or higher-quality data later. As data amount and quality is what gives you the main edge in AI, you won’t let this chance slip.If your challenge is about predictions, you need data from today/this week/this month to predict something for tomorrow/next week/next month. So you need to retrain the model with recent data.As time goes by, the world changes, and with it the reality your model used to reflect well a time ago. Think about estimating house prices and the changing real estate market.Users of your system will most likely find conditions under which your model makes wrong decisions. Especially if your system is worth cheating (such as the automatic processing of insurance claims), expect bad guys who will try it. So you need to adapt your model to eliminate or at least reduce the impact.The frequency of model updating depends on the use case and may range from hours to years. This frequency has a heavy impact on the level of automation you need for the flow from raw data to the new production-stage model. You can implement this automation in different ways which is a separate topic not considered here. But, in any case, you must provide the same level of automation for QA checks. This way, you make QA an unavoidable step properly integrated in the model development process.Imagine you have a nightly running script flow which collects data from different sources, starts the model training, builds the service with the new model and replaces the old version of this service. In this case, checks for data and model quality must be scripts running as part of your flow and raising a red flag if defined conditions are not met.Detecting data collection errorsIn very rare cases like our small bakery, all the data used in a model may come from a single source. For companies which are at least middle-sized, the data which is useful for predictions may be spread over multiple systems. In an average e-commerce company, the CRM knows about customer’s demographic data, the payment system about their buying behaviour, the web tracking system knows what they search for, the inventory system knows about the product you offer, and in addition, you want to use weather data from an external service. So most of the data takes a non-trivial multistep path before data science touches it. Whether that path involves manual operations or is fully automated with ETL tools — something can go wrong. And source systems may contain errors as well. So we need a set of “entrance checks” before training the model.Let us assume the data collection run is complete (we consider it to be a black box, leaving the details to data engineers) and you have a freshly updated table with customers or a folder with images.The easiest types of checks are statistics-based. Once the data collection process is implemented, verify the correctness of final results manually, i.e. by tracking selected entries in the source and target system (if your data engineering colleagues already did this, you’re lucky). Once that is verified, count entities which are important for model training (accounts, images, customer reviews, audio files). Introduce thresholds as to how many of them must be available to assume that data collection worked without major errors.Consider calculating further statistics which should not change significantly for your data in the long term: how your accounts are distributed by gender, what is the average review length, what is the most frequent image type, etc. For every statistic, define a threshold or range which will be validated before model training.You may want to know how many records (at least as an order of magnitude) are sufficient to train a good enough model. It’s hardly possible to get this number just out of problem description and data. Let’s judge the accuracy of the model after training; we will address that in the next blog post.Detecting data quality issuesAs next step think if you really want to use all available records in your model. Entries you will most likely fix or get rid of before training the model are:duplicatesentries created for testingentries with a wrong date entered unintentionally (like a birth year 1897, instead of 1987)entries covering use cases your model should not serve (like corporate accounts if you want a model for personal accounts only)Perform some exploratory data analysis. For every column/feature used in your model, you should know what exactly it means and what values it can take. Maybe a piece of documentation will be around, maybe it will be up-to-date. But don’t assume everything to be correct and aligned with documentation.For numeric columns like “age”, build a histogram. For categorical columns like “education”, list all possible values. To discover duplicates, check the uniqueness of technical keys and maybe also of some set of features (like the name and address for a customer).Another, more advanced way to discover strange records is “anomaly detection.” Imagine a customer who is 21 years old, has a PhD and 10 years of work experience. All the 3 data points are fine in themselves, but their combination is very unlikely; we can assume somebody just entered the wrong age. Discovering anomalies like this is a pure machine learning topic with a lot of great papers about it.Searching for explanationIf your data landscape is old enough, you likely discover a lot of issues. For some of them the explanation will be easy to find or obvious — but most likely not for all the issues. A lot of questions like “a record with this date looks strange, should I fix it or filter it out or leave it as it is?” will remain, and the only way I know is to get up from your chair and go ask some questions. Good candidates to ask are:colleagues who work with edge cases: customer support, operationscolleagues with a good knowledge of how the system will be used: customer support (again), QAcolleagues who just have been in the company for a long timeFixing data quality issuesWe just briefly touch upon this topic as it is mostly about data science and less about QA. Once you discover an issue, consider addressing it at its origin — a duplicate user record should be fixed directly in the CRM, a wrong aggregation of payments must be repaired in the ETL part. But you still should assume upstream systems as having data issues (one will be fixed but another will arise by implementing a new feature), and have checks and/or fixes for them.If the issue has an explanation but is not repairable (in the short term), which is often the case, you should fix it in order to prevent an impact of wrong data on your model. The fix is usually aboutfiltering out the record: you can e.g. remove duplicates by IDenriching missing data points from another source: e.g., missing gender can be guessed by looking up the first name in a dictionaryimputing missing data point: i.e. if age is missing use median age of the data setIn any case, cleaning every data issue is not mandatory for proceeding; a subset of your data may do for training as well. So fix first the issues which are (1) about important features (2) occur frequently and (3) easy to fix — and then train your model candidate. If it won’t show sufficient quality, you can go after harder issues.What’s nextNow we’re done with QA for the dataset and can proceed with building a model. QA for models will be the topic of our next post.Image from Biodiversity Heritage Library",Quality Assurance for Artificial Intelligence - Towards Data Science,,,,Quality Assurance for Artificial Intelligence - Towards Data Science,d935fc6b238,['Michael Perlin'],,,,,,,,

Here's How Including Artificial Intelligence in a Business Can Bolster the Productivity of a Team (infographic)

Artificial Intelligence, AI, is rapidly growing; especially in a working environment. However, the current state of our AI means that we can work alongside it in harmony.

AI is often seen in sci-fi movies. We’re watching these movies on our screens thinking “that is such a lifetime away from us, I won’t be around to see robots and hovercrafts” when in reality, it’s amongst us now. But, with how fast technology is growing, is that really a shock?

The question that you’re all asking yourself is “will AI replace my job?” and the answer is no. As it currently stands, AI has been formed in order to improve your life, rather than hinder it. What we’re seeing in current releases, is AI that will boost productivity and help you to effectively manage a workforce and the day-to-day running of your business.

By implementing AI into your business, you’ll improve the mental health of your staff, and give your workforce more space to breathe which, without AI, they wouldn’t have. It’s ironic but by introducing AI into your business, you actually make it more human.

As it stands, only 23% of businesses have incorporated AI into their day-to-day working life. Over the next 5 years, Forbes has estimated that AI in the workplace is expected to grow by a massive 50%.

Adzooma understands the importance of a healthy workforce and wants to demonstrate how including AI in a business can bolster the productivity of a team. They have done some extensive research into AI within the workplace and have created the visual below to show you how AI can be utilized.

How AI Will Improve Your Recruitment Process
Artificial Intelligence can be implemented into your recruitment process to take the long-winded initial stages out of your hands. When you begin your recruitment process, one of your first major tasks is to whittle down your list of potential candidates. If you’re doing this yourself, you’ll lose a lot of time that you could have spent doing something else. Or, if you’re working with a recruitment agency, they’ll do this for you. The downside to this is that recruitment agencies aren’t cheap.

AI tools such as Pymetrics assess candidates based on their emotional and cognitive characteristics and pair them up to your business and your current employees. While finding a knowledgeable candidate is essential, you also want them to fit into your business and become a great part of the workforce.

By implementing Pymetrics into your recruitment strategy, it’s estimated that your staff retention will increase by 50%, and it’ll take 75% less of your time to recruit someone.

Give AI Your Long, Boring Jobs
We all have tasks to do that we really don’t want to. Not because they’re difficult, but because they’re boring and time-consuming. And, when we don’t want to do something, our productivity takes a deep dive. We put it off and put it off until we can no longer get away with not doing it. Or, we push through it with paying little attention; this is often where mistakes will be made.

The main area where AI will improve your team’s productivity is by taking over your admin tasks. We understand how scary this sounds for Administrators, but actually, it’s known that by 2030, job growth will soar and those Administrators will be transitioned into a higher-skilled role.

There are many benefits to implementing AI into your workforce:

The accuracy of the work will vastly improve as no human errors will occur.
If an employee is doing a mundane task, they’ll get bored. This means that the task will take longer to complete as their productivity will freefall. A machine won’t get bored.
AI can carry out numerous tasks and make millions of decisions all at the same time. This means the speed of execution will skyrocket.
We all like to think that we’re not biased, but the majority of humans will cast judgement at some point in their working life. A machine has no thoughts or feelings and can, therefore, carry out tasks unbiased.
As humans, if we overwork ourselves, we’ll burn out. With a machine, burn out is eliminated. Not to mention they don’t need to take breaks or nip off to have lunch.


So, what jobs should succumb to AI?
We aren’t suggesting that you should fire everybody and hand over all your work to an AI system. We’re saying that maybe you should think about improving the productivity in your workforce by implementing an AI system that’ll take away boring daily tasks. It’s both productive and profitable.

As an example, here are some tasks that would benefit from having an AI system in place:

Data Analysing
Data analysing is a very long-winded task that consists of gathering and analysing large quantities of data. This data is used to spot trends and highlight opportunities where a business can target its customers to improve the turnover of their business.

Since 2010, there has been a 344% increase in the need for data scientists within a business; what with all the eCommerce websites and social media accounts. However, a data scientist can set a company back a tremendous amount of money. On average, the salary of a data scientist is $130,000 per year.

Deloitte’s LaborWise is an AI system that does your data analysing for you. It collects data from your website and uses analytics to identify trends, roadblocks, areas in the business that are spending a lot of money, and departments within the business that are understaffed.

Demand Forecasting
Demand forecasting is an integral part of an eCommerce business. In order to maintain correct stock levels, monitor supply disruptions, and predict changes in product demand, forecasting needs to be done effectively; incorrect forecasting can have disastrous outcomes.

Implementing an AI system to handle forecasting for the business is estimated to reduce errors within the supply chain by 50%.

Administration
An AI system to carry out administrative tasks is a great place to start if you’re thinking about implementing AI in the workplace. Again, this isn’t to replace Administrators, it’s simply to lighten the workload and remove any long-winded tasks; opening up your Administrators to carry out more important tasks.

Here are a few AI tools that will help lighten the load:

X.ai - This AI tool collates all of your calendars and figures out when the best time is for you to conduct, or be a part of, a meeting. Whether that’s with your work colleagues or a client.

Otter.ai - An AI tool that takes away the task of minute writing. Otter.ai has a microphone which listens to voices and creates detailed notes. It’s great for meetings, interviews and board meetings, where you wouldn’t want to miss out on any important details.

Spoke - Spoke is a very clever AI system that is incredibly knowledgeable when it comes to every HR-related. By asking the system a HR-related question, Spoke will produce the answer quickly. Users can ask Spoke questions across multiple channels such as text, email, Slack or web browser. If it can’t find the appropriate answer, the AI system will send the question off to the most appropriate person within your team, such as the HR manager.

Skype Translator - This is probably the most known form of AI systems - a real-time translator. Skype Translator has a microphone and speaker system, where users can speak or type their sentence into the tool, and Skype Translator will then translate the text into the desired language. It’s great for worldwide communications.

MobileMonkey - MobileMonkey is another AI system that you may be familiar with. MobileMonkey is a tool that’s plugged into your website. It’s essentially a trained chatbot that will answer customer queries. If the chatbot can’t find the correct answer, the message will automatically be fed through to a human.

Marketing
The main market for AI systems is digital marketing. Advances in technology mean that digital marketing agencies can personalise their products, offers, and services and target consumers more effectively than ever before.

Google recently launched machine learning algorithms which embrace artificial intelligence. Google’s algorithms consist of NLP or Natural Language Processing for SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) and Smart Bidding for paid advertising.

Training with AI
There are a handful of AI systems that have developed in recent years that help businesses train their staff. Whether staff need a refresher course in a specific tool or you’re teaching new staff the general rules and guidelines of the business. Here are two of our favourite on-site AI training systems:

Chorus - is a great tool for sales representatives. This AI system is plugged into your phone lines and listens and records calls. Chorus also offers its users tips during their calls, and in real-time. This piece of technology is sure to remove the need for training and allows the employees to learn at their own pace.

Cogito - is a similar phone system, however, it listens out for your tone, the words that you’re using and your approach with the person that you’re talking to. It’s all about mindfulness with this system. Cogito will listen to your phone conversations and give you tips as you’re talking, telling you to slow down if nerves have got the better of you and you’re speaking too quickly.

The Future of AI
We understand the concerns of implementing AI in the workplace. As humans, we want to be needed, and having our jobs taken from us by a robot, is all but slightly embarrassing. With how our technology is forming, the future of AI is set to ensure that staff are efficient, productive and are putting their time to better use. Who knows what career paths this could open for us?

Artificial intelligence would detect hate speech and offensive words on social media and then encourage users to reconsider their posts as part of a new system that gives two Daniel High School students a chance to work alongside Clemson University researchers.
The system, HateDefender, is in its early stages, but the idea is to prevent the spread of hate speech on social media without resorting to censorship.
Roger Hu is a Daniel High School student who is working with Clemson University professors and graduate students to detect hate speech on social media.
Researchers are wrapping up the first version of their system as the run-up to the U.S. presidential election inspires a fresh wave of venomous attacks. About four in 10 Americans have personally experienced online harassment and 63% consider it a major problem, according to a 2017 report from the Pew Research Center.
Once HateDefender is up and running, a social-media user who posts objectionable material would receive a warning that points out which words were potentially insulting. It would be up to users to decide whether to edit their comments.
“Too much censorship is not generally acceptable by users,” said Nishant Vishwamitra, a Ph.D. student who is working on the project. “Sometimes we need to explain the problem and at the same time give social networks the freedom to continue operating.”
If adopted, HateDefender would be embedded on social media sites. Users wouldn’t have to download an additional app or plug-in for it to function.
The team found that HateDefender accurately detects hate speech 90.82% of the time and offensive language 89.1% of the time.
Feng Luo is overseeing the creation of HateDefender.
The team has developed a new way of detecting hate speech and offensive language based on pronunciation. Researchers found that much of the speech they were targeting contained spelling and lexical errors that created “noise,” making it harder for the computer to detect.
What also makes HateDefender stand out is the educational opportunity it presents to Daniel High students, which includes Roger Hu, who is working alongside professors and graduate students to create the system.
Hu, a junior, said he helped write papers, made graphs with data sets, labeled hate words and helped write code. It’s a unique experience that he plans to use throughout life.
“When I go to college, I want to major in computer science,” he said. “Because I’m interested in AI, I want to learn more advanced techniques in such an emerging area.”
The project is overseen by Professor Feng Luo from Clemson’s School of Computing.
The idea to focus on hate speech came from Matthew Costello, an assistant professor of sociology at Clemson.  He approached Luo after conducting research into the online habits that lead people to come into contact with hate and become targets of hate. He also researched how people respond to hate. 
“I had the idea that it would be great to auto-detect hate speech and then potentially block it, if people were interested in trying to block it,” Costello said. “Dr. Luo has the skills to do that.”
Amy Apon, the C. Tycho Howle Director of the School of Computing, said the project underscores the growing role of computing in a wide range of research, including in the social sciences. 
“Working across disciplines and departments is becoming increasingly important,” she said. “Artificial intelligence and other advanced techniques are opening new doors for scientific discovery and helping create new products and services. HateDefender is a great example of a team effort that addresses a real-world problem while creating a unique educational experience.”
HateDefender and the method for detecting hate speech are detailed in two papers the team plans to present at an Association for Computing Machinery workshop and conference. Co-authors on both papers are Hu, Dorris, Vishwamitra, Luo, and Costello.
“I think it’s a huge experience for high school students,” Luo said. “They are learning what research is about and how to write a meaningful paper for publication. It helps establish an interest in research and gives them confidence that they can do it.”
The names of the papers are, “Towards Automatic Detection and Explanation of Hate Speech and Offensive Language” and “On the Impact of Word Representation in Hate Speech and Offensive Language Detection and Explanation.” 
HateDefender is the latest artificial intelligence research to come from Luo, who invites about two or three high school students to work as interns each summer.
Luo’s team has applied some of the same artificial intelligence techniques to create BullyDefender, an app designed to counteract visual cyberbullying.
