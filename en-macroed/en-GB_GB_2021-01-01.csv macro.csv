Humanity have always dreamed of some omniscient, omnipotent genie that can shoulder its workloads. Now, thanks to the hard work of computer scientists in the labs, we have our answer in artificial intelligence, which if you buy into the hype can do just about anything your company needs done — at least some of it, some of the time.
Yes, the AI innovations are amazing. Virtual helpers like Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant would seem magical to a time traveler from as recently as 10 to 15 years ago. Your word is their command, and unlike voice recognition tools from the 1990s, they often come up with the right answer — if you avoid curveball questions like asking how many angels can dance on the head of a pin.

[ Cut through the hype with our practical guide to machine learning in business and find out the10 signs you’re ready for AI — but might not succeed. | | Get the latest insights with our CIO Daily newsletter. ]

But for all of their magic, AIs are still reliant on computer programming and that means they suffer from all of the limitations that hold back the more pedestrian code such as spreadsheets or word processors. They do a better job juggling the statistical vagaries of the world, but ultimately, they’re still just computers that make decisions by computing a function and determining whether some number is bigger or smaller than a threshold. Underneath all of the clever mystery and sophisticated algorithms is a set of transistors implementing an IF-THEN decision.











 
 
 
Can we live with this? Do we have any choice? With the drumbeat for AI across all industries only getting louder, we must begin to learn to live with the following dark secrets of artificial intelligence.

Much of what you find with AI is obvious
The toughest job for an AI scientist is telling the boss that the AI has discovered what everyone already knew. Perhaps it examined 10 billion photographs and discovered the sky is blue. But if you forgot to put night-time photos in the training set, it won’t realize that it gets dark at night. 
But how can an AI avoid the obvious conclusions? The strongest signals in the data will be obvious to anyone working in the trenches and they’ll also be obvious to the computer algorithms digging through the numbers. They’ll be the first answer that the retriever will bring back and drop at your feet. At least the algorithms won’t expect a treat.











 
 
 
Exploiting nuanced AI insights may not be worth it
Of course, good AIs also lock on to small differences when the data is precise. But using these small insights can require deep strategic shifts to the company’s workflow. Some of the subtle distinctions will be too subtle to be worth chasing. And computers will still obsess over them. The problem is that big signals are obvious and small signals may yield small or even nonexistent gains.
Mysterious computers are more threatening
While early researchers hoped that the mathematical approach of a computer algorithm would lend an air of respectability to the final decision, many people in the world aren’t willing to surrender to the god of logic. If anything, the complexity and mystery of AI make it easier for anyone unhappy with the answer to attack the process. Was the algorithm biased? The more mystery and complexity under the hood, the more reasons for the world to be suspicious and angry.
AI is mainly curve fitting
Scientists have been plotting some noisy data and drawing lines through the points for hundreds of years. Many of the AI algorithms at the core of machine learning algorithms do just that. They take some data and draw a line through them. Much of the advancement has come from finding ways to break the problem into thousands, millions, or maybe even billions of little problems and then drawing lines through all of them. It’s not magic; it’s just an assembly line for how we’ve been doing science for centuries. People who don’t like AI and find it easy to poke holes in its decisions focus on the fact that there’s often no deep theory or philosophical scaffolding to lend credibility to the answer. It’s just a guesstimate for the slope of some line.











 
 
 
Gathering data is the real job
Everyone who’s started studying data science begins to realize that there’s not much time for science because finding the data is the real job. AI is a close cousin to data science and it has the same challenges. It’s 0.01% inspiration and 99.99% perspiring over file formats, missing data fields, and character codes.
You need massive data to reach deeper conclusions
Some answers are easy to find, but deeper, more complex answers often require more and more data. Sometimes the amount of data will rise exponentially. AI can leave you with an insatiable appetite for more and more bits.
You’re stuck with the biases of your data
Just like the inhabitants of Plato’s Cave, we’re all limited by what we can see and perceive. AIs are no different. They’re explicitly limited by their training set. If there are biases in the data — and there will be some — the AI will inherit them. If there are holes in the data, there will be holes in the AI’s understanding of the world.  











 
 
 
AI is a black hole for electricity
Most good games have a final level or an ultimate goal. AIs, though, can keep getting more and more complex. As long as you’re willing to pay the electricity bill, they’ll keep churning out more complex models with more nodes, more levels, and more internal state. Maybe this extra complexity will be enough to make the model truly useful. Maybe some emergent sentient behavior will come out of the next run. But maybe we’ll need an even larger collection of GPUs running through the night to really capture the effect.
Explainable AI is just another turtle
AI researchers have been devoting more time of late trying to explain just what the AI is doing.  We can dig into the data and discover that the trained model relies heavily on these parameters that come from a particular corner of the data set. Often, though, the explanations are like those offered by magicians who explain one trick by performing another. Answering the question why is surprisingly hard. You can look at the simplest linear models and stare at the parameters, but often you’ll be left scratching your head. If the model says to multiply the number of miles driven each year by a factor of 0.043255, you might wonder why not 0.043256 or 0.7, or maybe something outrageously different like 411 or 10 billion. Once you’re using a continuum, all of the numbers along the axis might be right. 
It’s like the old model where the Earth was just sitting on a giant Turtle. And where did this turtle stand? On the back of another Turtle. And where does the next stand? It’s turtles all the way down.











 
 
 
Trying to be fair is a challenge
You could leave height out of the training set, but the odds are pretty good that your AI program will find some other proxy to flag the taller people and choose them for your basketball squad. Maybe it will be shoe size. Or perhaps reach. People have dreamed that asking a neutral AI to make an unbiased decision would make the world a fairer place, but sometimes the issues are deeply embedded in reality and the algorithms can’t do any better.
Sometimes the fixes are even worse
Is forcing an AI to be fair any real solution? Some try to insist that AIs generate results with certain preordained percentages. They put their thumb on the scale and rewrite the algorithms to change the output. But then people start to wonder why we bother with any training or data analysis if you’ve already decided the answer you want.
Humans are the real problem
We’re generally happy with AIs when the stakes are low. If you’ve got 10 million pictures to sort, you’re going to be happy if some AI will generate reasonably accurate results most of the time. Sure, there may be issues and mistakes. Some of the glitches might even reflect deep problems with the AI’s biases, issues that might be worthy of a 200-page hairsplitting thesis.











 
 
 
But the AIs aren’t the problem. They will do what they’re told. If they get fussy and start generating error messages, we can hide those messages. If the training set doesn’t generate perfect results, we can put aside the whining result asking for more data. If the accuracy isn’t as high as possible, we can just file that result away. The AIs will go back to work and do the best they can.
Humans, though, are a completely different animal. The AIs are their tools and the humans will be the ones who want to use them to find an advantage and profit from it. Some of these plans will be relatively innocent, but some will be driven by secret malice aforethought. Many times, when we run into a bad AI, it’s because it’s the puppet on the string for some human that’s profiting from the bad behavior.

Scientists have developed a machine-learning method that crunches massive amounts of data to help determine which existing medications could improve outcomes in diseases for which they are not prescribed.The intent of this work is to speed up drug repurposing, which is not a new concept – think Botox injections, first approved to treat crossed eyes and now a migraine treatment and top cosmetic strategy to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.Ping ZhangBut getting to those new uses typically involves a mix of serendipity and time-consuming and expensive randomized clinical trials to ensure that a drug deemed effective for one disorder will be useful as a treatment for something else.The Ohio State University researchers created a framework that combines enormous patient care-related datasets with high-powered computation to arrive at repurposed drug candidates and the estimated effects of those existing medications on a defined set of outcomes.Though this study focused on proposed repurposing of drugs to prevent heart failure and stroke in patients with coronary artery disease, the framework is flexible – and could be applied to most diseases.“This work shows how artificial intelligence can be used to ‘test’ a drug on a patient, and speed up hypothesis generation and potentially speed up a clinical trial,” said senior author Ping Zhang, assistant professor of computer science and engineering and biomedical informatics at Ohio State. “But we will never replace the physician – drug decisions will always be made by clinicians.”The research is published today (Jan. 4, 2021) in Nature Machine Intelligence.Drug repurposing is an attractive pursuit because it could lower the risk associated with safety testing of new medications and dramatically reduce the time it takes to get a drug into the marketplace for clinical use.Randomized clinical trials are the gold standard for determining a drug’s effectiveness against a disease, but Zhang noted that machine learning can account for hundreds – or thousands – of human differences within a large population that could influence how medicine works in the body. These factors, or confounders, ranging from age, sex and race to disease severity and the presence of other illnesses, function as parameters in the deep learning computer algorithm on which the framework is based.That information comes from “real-world evidence,” which is longitudinal observational data about millions of patients captured by electronic medical records or insurance claims and prescription data.“Real-world data has so many confounders. This is the reason we have to introduce the deep learning algorithm, which can handle multiple parameters,” said Zhang, who leads the Artificial Intelligence in Medicine Lab and is a core faculty member in the Translational Data Analytics Institute at Ohio State. “If we have hundreds or thousands of confounders, no human being can work with that. So we have to use artificial intelligence to solve the problem.“We are the first team to introduce use of the deep learning algorithm to handle the real-world data, control for multiple confounders, and emulate clinical trials.”The research team used insurance claims data on nearly 1.2 million heart-disease patients, which provided information on their assigned treatment, disease outcomes and various values for potential confounders. The deep learning algorithm also has the power to take into account the passage of time in each patient’s experience – for every visit, prescription and diagnostic test. The model input for drugs is based on their active ingredients.Applying what is called causal inference theory, the researchers categorized, for the purposes of this analysis, the active drug and placebo patient groups that would be found in a clinical trial. The model tracked patients for two years – and compared their disease status at that end point to whether or not they took medications, which drugs they took and when they started the regimen.“With causal inference, we can address the problem of having multiple treatments. We don’t answer whether drug A or drug B works for this disease or not, but figure out which treatment will have the better performance,” Zhang said.Their hypothesis: that the model would identify drugs that could lower the risk for heart failure and stroke in coronary artery disease patients.The model yielded nine drugs considered likely to provide those therapeutic benefits, three of which are currently in use – meaning the analysis identified six candidates for drug repurposing. Among other findings, the analysis suggested that a diabetes medication, metformin, and escitalopram, used to treat depression and anxiety, could lower risk for heart failure and stroke in the model patient population. As it turns out, both of those drugs are currently being tested for their effectiveness against heart disease.Zhang stressed that what the team found in this case study is less important than how they got there.“My motivation is applying this, along with other experts, to find drugs for diseases without any current treatment. This is very flexible, and we can adjust case-by-case,” he said. “The general model could be applied to any disease if you can define the disease outcome.”The research was supported by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, which funds the Center for Clinical and Translational Science at Ohio State.Graduate student Ruoqi Liu and research assistant professor Lai Wei, both at Ohio State, also worked on the study.

Artificial Intelligence Falls Short in Detecting Diabetic Eye Disease


Of seven artificial intelligence algorithms tested, only one performed better than human clinicians in detecting diabetic eye diseases.

Artificial intelligence algorithms designed to detect diabetic eye disease may not perform as well as developers claim, according to a study published in Diabetes Care.







Diabetes is the leading cause of new cases of blindness among adults in the US, researchers stated. The current shortage of eye-care providers would make it impossible to keep up with demand to provide the requisite annual screenings for this population. And because current approaches of treating retinopathy are most effective when the condition is caught early, eye doctors need an accurate way to quickly identify patients who need treatment. 
To overcome this issue, researchers and vendors have developed artificial intelligence algorithms to help accurately detect diabetic retinopathy. Researchers set out to test the effectiveness of seven AI-based screening algorithms to diagnose diabetic retinopathy against the diagnostic expertise of retina specialists.
Five companies produced the algorithms tested in the study – two in the US, one in China, one in Portugal, and one in France. While many of these companies report excellent results in clinical trials, their performance in real-world settings was unknown.
Researchers used the algorithm-based technologies on retinal images from nearly 24,000 veterans who sought diabetic retinopathy screening at the Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Healthcare System and the Atlanta VA Healthcare System from 2006 to 2018.
The team conducted a test in which the performance of each algorithm and the performance of the human screeners who work in the VA teleretinal screening system were all compared to the diagnoses that expert ophthalmologists gave when looking at the same images.
The results showed that the algorithms don’t perform as well as human clinicians. Three of the algorithms performed reasonably well when compared to the physicians’ diagnoses and one did worse, with a sensitivity of 74.42 percent.
Just one algorithm performed as well as human screeners in the test, achieving a comparable sensitivity of 80.47 percent and specificity of 81.28 percent.
Researchers also found that the algorithms’ performance varied when analyzing images from patient populations in Seattle and Atlanta care settings – indicating that algorithms may need to be trained with a wider range of images.
“It’s alarming that some of these algorithms are not performing consistently since they are being used somewhere in the world,"" said lead researcher Aaron Lee, assistant professor of ophthalmology at the University of Washington School of Medicine.
The team noted that differences in camera equipment and technique could be one explanation, and that their study demonstrates how critical it is for practices to test AI screeners and follow the guidelines about how to properly obtain images of patients’ eyes, because the algorithms are designed to work with a minimum quality of images.
While many studies highlight the potential for AI and machine learning to enhance the work of healthcare professionals, the findings of this research show that the technology is still very much in its infancy. Additionally, the results suggest that while these algorithms may have a high degree of accuracy and sensitivity on their own in the research realm, they may benefit from human input when being used in real-world clinical settings.
Separate studies have found that advanced analytics tools are most effective when combined with the expertise of human providers. In October 2019, a team from NYU School of Medicine and the NYU Center for Data Science showed that combining AI with analysis from human radiologists significantly improved breast cancer detection.
“Our study found that AI identified cancer-related patterns in the data that radiologists could not, and vice versa,” said senior study author Krzysztof J. Geras, PhD, assistant professor in the Department of Radiology at NYU Langone.
“AI detected pixel-level changes in tissue invisible to the human eye, while humans used forms of reasoning not available to AI. The ultimate goal of our work is to augment, not replace, human radiologists,” added Geras, who is also an affiliated faculty member at the NYU Center for Data Science.
In order to ensure humans aren’t left out of the equation, some researchers are working to develop algorithms that have the option to defer clinical decisions to human experts. A machine learning tool recently designed by MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL) is able to adapt when and how often it defers to human experts based on factors such as the expert’s availability and level of experience.
“Our algorithms allow you to optimize for whatever choice you want, whether that’s the specific prediction accuracy or the cost of the expert’s time and effort,” said David Sontag, the Von Helmholtz Associate Professor of Medical Engineering in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.
“Moreover, by interpreting the learned rejector, the system provides insights into how experts make decisions, and in which settings AI may be more appropriate, or vice-versa.”

Innovation: Puntambekar contributing to $20 million, NSF-funded artificial intelligence initiative 

January 2, 2021 




















By Lynn Armitage, WCER Communications
UW–Madison’s Sadhana Puntambekar will collaborate with national researchers on establishing one of five artificial intelligence (AI) institutes and education hubs. A $100 million initiative of the National Science Foundation, the centers are the single most significant federal investment to date in exploring how AI can benefit the United States’ quality of life, economy, and international competitiveness.
Puntambekar
With an investment of $20 million over five years in each AI institute, the NSF has formed collaborations among researchers from some 30 universities across the country. Puntambekar, the sole representative from UW–Madison, will collaborate with peers from nine universities on the project known as the NSF AI Institute for Student-AI Teaming, spearheaded by the University of Colorado, Boulder. This institute will examine how AI can contribute to the future of education and workforce development.
“What is most exciting about this project is that it takes my previous work on distributed scaffolding to new levels in which we will develop paradigms for students, teachers, and AI agents, each bringing different strengths to work together and complement each other,” says Puntambekar, a Sears-Bascom professor with the School of Education’s Department of Educational Psychology and director of the Interactive Design and Learning Lab within the Wisconsin Center for Education Research. She adds that the institute’s vision is to create a classroom in which teachers, students, and AI work synergistically for effective teaching and learning.
According to Puntambekar, “AI models will help identify learning and collaboration patterns that would be nearly impossible for teachers to identify on their own, let alone in real time. For instance, using content and semantic analysis, AI could recognize two groups that are developing complementary arguments and suggest they share their work to develop more complete reasoning.” She says that AI can also help alert teachers about when, where, and why it may be productive for them to engage with students.
In addition to collaborating with the University of Colorado, Boulder, Puntambekar will work closely on this AI initiative with education partners from seven other universities: Colorado State University; the University of California, Santa Cruz; the University of California, Berkeley; Brandeis University; Worcester Polytechnic University; Georgia Institute of Technology; and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
This last month has been exceptionally rewarding for the WCER researcher. Puntambekar has received two other NSF grants exceeding a million dollars each to help advance STEM learning in middle school.
“It’s quite unbelievable to land three grants, one after the other,” shares Puntambekar. “All the projects that were funded proposed innovative uses of technology to support and understand students’ learning. And they all build on my prior work on federally funded projects.”

In 2017, I visited one of the world’s first and most innovative Artificial Intelligence  companies, DeepMind Technologies on Pancras Square in London. This was an eye-opening experience for me as it heightened my understanding of what the best people in the game worked on and just how far exactly the technology has reached beyond the hype. I came face to face with applications that not only demonstrated the immense possibilities of Artificial Intelligence like the Alpha, which famously beat the human world champion of the complex board game, ‘Go’ but also some great examples of how machine learning is helping revolutionise areas like Healthcare with DeepMind’s work with some hospitals and even the United Kingdom’s NHS.  However, my earlier observation was that Artificial Intelligence was at best aspirational at the time, with a lot of future potentials but not quite there yet as the best examples where games, or toys or social media influence.
Since my visit to DeepMind, they have gone from AlphaZero to AlphaGo and now to AlphaFold, which is far from a chess winning machine learning algorithm. AlphaFold accurately predicts the shape of proteins. Not the protein in the context of nutrition but the self-assembling nanomachines that do almost everything in the body. Our cellular processes — everything, which can be said to make us alive — are tasks carried out by proteins. Protein folding (one of the toughest problems in science) could thus help scientists understand the biological processes of every living thing. This is because a protein’s shape is closely linked with its function, and the ability to predict this structure unlocks a greater understanding of what it does and how it works. This means drugs could be discovered more rapidly, diseases treated faster and the unlocking of many great mysteries. Thanks to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. But just what are these terms that people throw around a lot and how do these techniques work?

Artificial Intelligence
In global terms, 2021 heralds us into a new decade of exciting advancements in technology. One of the most talked-about aspects of technology is Artificial Intelligence or AI. Because it is constantly evolving and transforming, the definition of AI is complicated, depending on who you ask. Hollywood movies have for long used sentient humanoid robots to define it, while another popular culture has popularised self-driving cars and chess-playing bots. In simple terms, AI refers to machines that can reason and act on their own. Like humans and animals, artificially intelligent machines can make decisions for themselves when faced with new situations.


Machine Learning
The quest for artificial intelligence and its builders is the creation of machines that can reason, learn, and act intelligently. Most of the advancements in AI you hear about today are machine learning-based. Machine Learning is, therefore, a type of artificial intelligence that utilises statistics to find patterns in huge sets of data. Data here refers to anything in the digital form fed into the machine learning algorithm ranging from numbers, words, pictures, likes, clicks, etc. Popular examples of machine learning applications are recommendation systems on YouTube and Netflix, search engines like google, social network feeds like Facebook and voice assistants like Siri. Within all these examples is the deep observation of your behavior whether it’s what you watch, click, listen to, like or what you ignore, dislike or say in the case of voice assistance. A pattern is then established by machine learning and an educated guess is made about what you may like or do on the platforms.
Deep Learning
This brings me to a type of machine learning called Deep Learning. Imagine a tremendously better machine learning that can identify and amplify even the smallest pattern. It is also referred to as a deep neural network due to its multi-layered computational nodes that work cohesively to predict, with relative accuracy, based on the data it is fed.  So, in essence, deep learning is basically neural networks; which get their name inspired by the inner workings of the human brain with the nodes acting like neurons and the network acting like a brain. 




You now get the idea of Artificial Intelligence and you know that Machine Learning is by far its most prevalent application. You understand how machine and deep learning work. To complete this gamut, you should know that machine learning (and deep learning) has three varieties. Supervised, unsupervised and reinforced learning.  Supervised learning is the most prevalent variety whereby the computer or machine is told what to look for by labelling the data in order to signal to the machine to look for similar patterns. Every time you watch a show on Netflix, the algorithm will remember it and try to find similar shows based on that reference.
On the contrary, unsupervised learning allows the machine to look for whatever patterns it can find. Here the data has no labels and the algorithm just combs through everything and sorts or arranges based on a wide-ranging parameter identified in the patterns. This is way less popular than supervised learning but has strong applications and is gaining a lot of ground in cybersecurity.
Lastly, there is Reinforcement Learning, which involves the algorithm learning from trial and error to achieve a clear objective. Many consider this to be the latest frontier of machine learning. The algorithm tries out various things towards achieving the set objective and gets either rewarded or penalised depending on how much the particular behaviour helps or hinders it from achieving the set objective.


These are the basic concepts around artificial intelligence and are pretty much the areas to get the most attention from this decade onwards, as we set into a different type of world where artificial intelligence will take on new definitions and become much more practical rather than aspirational as it has been in the past decades.

A week earlier, The New York Times reported that the company had paid tens of millions of dollars to two executives who had been accused of sexual misconduct toward our co-workers, staying silent about the alleged abuse and letting them walk away with no consequences.People speaking at the protests that morning recounted their own experiences of harassment and discrimination at the company. In San Francisco, one woman held up a sign reading, “I reported and he got promoted.” Others read, “Happy to quit for $90 million, no sexual harassment required” and “Unfair workplaces create unfair platforms.”We’d had enough.The two of us are software engineers, and we were recently elected executive chair and vice chair of the Alphabet Workers Union, a group of more than 200 workers in the United States who believe our company’s structure needs to change.For far too long, thousands of us at Google — and other subsidiaries of Alphabet, Google’s parent company — have had our workplace concerns dismissed by executives. Our bosses have collaborated with repressive governments around the world. They have developed artificial intelligence technology for use by the Department of Defense and profited from ads by a hate group. They have failed to make the changes necessary to meaningfully address our retention issues with people of color.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTMost recently, Timnit Gebru, a leading artificial intelligence researcher and one of the few Black women in her field, said she was fired over her work to fight bias. Her offense? Conducting research that was critical of large-scale A.I. models and being critical of existing diversity and inclusion efforts. In response, thousands of our colleagues organized, demanding an explanation. Both of us have heard from colleagues — some new, some with over a decade at the company — who have decided that working at Alphabet is no longer a choice they can make in good conscience.Sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter  Get expert analysis of the news and a guide to the big ideas shaping the world every weekday morning.  Get it sent to your inbox.Workers have mobilized against these abuses before. Organized workers at the company forced executives to drop Project Maven, the company’s artificial-intelligence program with the Pentagon, and Project Dragonfly, its plan to launch a censored search engine in China. Some of Alphabet’s subcontractors won a $15 minimum hourly wage, parental leave, and health insurance after an employee outcry. And the practice of forced arbitration for claims of sexual harassment was ended after the November 2018 walkout — albeit only for full-time employees, not contractors. A few months later, Google announced that it would end forced arbitration for employees for all claims.To those who are skeptical of unions or believe that tech companies are more innovative without unions, we want to point out that these and other larger problems persist. Discrimination and harassment continue. Alphabet continues to crack down on those who dare to speak out, and keep workers from speaking on sensitive and publicly important topics, like antitrust and monopoly power. For a handful of wealthy executives, this discrimination and unethical working environment are working as intended, at the cost of workers with less institutional power, especially Black, brown, queer, trans, disabled, and female workers. Each time workers organize to demand change, Alphabet’s executives make token promises, doing the bare minimum in the hopes of placating workers.It’s not enough. Today, we’re building on years of organizing efforts at Google to create a formal structure for workers. So far, 226 of us have signed union cards with the Communications Workers of America — the first step in winning a recognized bargaining unit under U.S. law. In other words, we are forming a union.We are the workers who built Alphabet. We write code, clean offices, serve food, drive buses, test self-driving cars and do everything needed to keep this behemoth running. We joined Alphabet because we wanted to build technology that improves the world. Yet time and again, company leaders have put profits ahead of our concerns. We are joining together — temps, vendors, contractors, and full-time employees — to create a unified worker voice. We want Alphabet to be a company where workers have a meaningful say in decisions that affect us and the societies we live in.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTAs union members, we have created an elected leadership and representative structure with dues-paying members. Our union will be open to all Alphabet workers, regardless of classification. About half of the workers at Google are temps, vendors or contractors. They are paid lower salaries, receive fewer benefits, and have little job stability compared with full-time employees, even though they often do the exact same work. They are also more likely to be Black or brown — a segregated employment system that keeps half of the company’s work force in second-class roles. Our union will seek to undo this grave inequity.Everyone at Alphabet — from bus drivers to programmers, from salespeople to janitors — plays a critical part in developing our technology. But right now, a few wealthy executives define what the company produces and how its workers are treated. This isn’t the company we want to work for. We care deeply about what we build and what it’s used for. We are responsible for the technology we bring into the world. And we recognize that its implications reach far beyond the walls of Alphabet.Our union will work to ensure that workers know what they’re working on, and can do their work at a fair wage, without fear of abuse, retaliation or discrimination. When Google went public in 2004, it said it would be a company that “does good things for the world even if we forgo some short-term gains.” Its motto used to be “Don’t be evil.”We will live by that motto. Alphabet is a powerful company, responsible for vast swaths of the internet. It is used by billions of people across the world. It has a responsibility to prioritize the public good. It has a responsibility to its thousands of workers and billions of users to make the world a better place.

A popular misconception is that programming languages are crucial for an AI framework based on neural networks. The results of an AI application are determined by the model architecture rather than the particular language.
Unsurprisingly, Natural Language Processing (NLP), computer vision, and image processing are massive driving forces in AI.
Most popular neural processing frameworks are available as cloud services, such as Google's Tensorflow. According to my data analysis from Stack Overflow, Google's Tensorflow was the most popular machine learning framework, both by installations and downloads, in 2018.
Let us now look at the top open-source AI frameworks.

1) Tensorflow
Google Tensorflow, an open-source software framework for building and using machine learning neural networks, is very easy to set up and extend. It's the most popular deep learning framework, with the largest number of GitHub stars and the second-highest percentage of open source repositories. 
Tensorflow is probably the most comfortable framework for beginners to work with. However, some neural processing experts may feel a little overwhelmed by the sheer amount of tools and features, making it almost impenetrable to experienced developers.
We will now learn about the next AI framework, RNN.
2) RNN
RNN is an emerging framework for supervised learning and has an extremely flexible and intuitive interface. It's also suitable for designing algorithms for ""deep learning,"" which can be used to distinguish between ""like"" and ""dislike"" in data sets. 
RNN is the second most popular deep learning framework for neural processing and natural language processing. The user community has been extraordinarily active and very helpful, and the project is under active development. According to neural processing experts, it's not the right choice for general ML coding because of the extra layers of abstraction. Neural processing expert Joe Callaghan compared RNN to WATM and said, ""RNN is too hard to learn, but a lot of fun to experiment with."" (Source: Stack Overflow)
The next AI framework is theano.
3) Theano
Theano, an open-source python library for deep learning, is also popular in the neural processing and data science communities. It's widely known for making it easy to implement complex neural networks by abstracting away the neural network components (such as the layers and hidden layers). It's often used to build and train AI models on graphics processing units (GPUs) and has been adopted by Facebook for both training and deploying AI applications.
Theano comes with a library of algorithms that perform neural network operations on data frames. It works with Python, C++, Java, Julia, Scala, and Tensorflow and is currently the most popular AI framework used by developers who use either Tensorflow or Theano. Theoretically, Theano can be used on any platform, but most Theano developers use Tensorflow and Tensorboard.
Theano is a deep learning framework with a comprehensive library of complex algorithms. It is used for training models to perform image classification, object detection, language translation, and speech recognition. Theano has the most extensive library of popular machine learning algorithms, easily combined with Tensorflow.
Tensorflow and Theano are used for most deep learning applications. However, they are not the best choice for NLP.
4) PyTorch
PyTorch is an optimized Python framework for building machine learning algorithms. Researchers often use it for research purposes, but it's also popular among developers who use Tensorflow. 
Medium is a free, open-source Python framework for creating systems, large or small. According to the developers, it's the most ""intuitive"" framework for building systems because it has the most comprehensive interface to hardware accelerators and a friendly API. However, it has a reputation for slow response times when dealing with GPUs.
Torch's versatility is impressive, and developers can use it to train, test, and deploy systems for deep learning and NLP. However, it can also be challenging to set up and maintain, and it doesn't seem to be used as much as other, more established frameworks. 
Parsey McParseface is a Python library for building machine learning models. Its interface is similar to Theano, but it supports a broader set of APIs and supports a more comprehensive range of training data types. 
We will now look at the next AI framework.
5) Caffe2
It is essential to understand that Caffe2 is not a traditional framework for AI training. Instead, it is a trained inference engine based on Neural Networks. The end goal of Caffe2 is to provide the best results in a highly efficient manner compared to Caffe. 
Caffe2 is a powerful open-source library that makes it easy to create deep learning models using the PyTorch framework. We can quickly develop scalable models and get rid of the typical computations involved in traditional models. That is why with Caffe2, we can make the most of our machines and get maximum efficiency out of them.
It is a Python library, and there is no need to worry about any other libraries or third party applications as you can rely on it to furnish the whole framework you will use in the project.
The Best Neural Processing Frameworks for Beginners
Some advanced deep learning frameworks allow neural processing, but many developers are unaware of the many prebuilt plugins and libraries that can enhance RNN and Tensorflow. These frameworks have been incorporated into products such as Microsoft Azure ML and Google Cloud Machine Learning.

Mylica is a Python framework for running neural processing, reinforcement learning, and reinforcement learning, easily customized for specific projects' needs. 
Karos is an open-source reinforcement learning framework that includes a library of reinforcement learning algorithms. It's famous for training reinforcement learning systems on GPUs, and it is compatible with Tensorflow. 
Trainedata is a Python library for creating large-scale reinforcement learning systems. The library's algorithms can run on Python 2.7, 3.4, and 4.x.
Vowpal Wabbit is an open-source deep learning framework that supports reinforcement learning. The idea behind Vowpal Wabbit is to accelerate the training of neural networks in reinforcement learning systems. 

Python has emerged as the most popular language for NLP development. Although useful for other applications, most of these frameworks and libraries are optimized for running on the Python Virtual Machine, which provides highly efficient performance for processing tensor data. It is a very convenient framework for the development of neural network applications.
Deep learning and neural networks are becoming more popular in some fields, including computer vision, health care, and cybersecurity. Machine learning in this emerging field has led to many new applications. As data sources increase, data scientists' demand is likely to increase significantly, leading to more demand for neural processing skills. To take advantage of this trend for your career, consider a comprehensive skilling programs like the Caltech Post Graduate Program in AI and Machine Learning, a collaboration between Simplilearn and Caltech CTME and The Masters in Artificial Intelligence, a dual degree program in collaboration with the International University of Applied Sciences (IU) Germany in collaboration with the London South Bank University (LSBU).

 Replika: My AI Friend is an app unlike any other. While most apps out there with chatbots use them as virtual assistants, Replika markets its chatbot as—you guessed it—a friend. 








 With its promised ability to ""perceive"" and evaluate abstract quantities such as emotion, Replika’s chatbot might just do justice to its aspirationally human description. 

 From a heart-wrenching origin story to an awe-inspiring backend, Replika is one of those fascinating things that never stop being interesting. Read on to find out about what it is that makes Replika’s AI so remarkable and what promises it holds for the future. 


 The Origins of Replika 
 Replika’s earliest version—a simple AI chatbot—was created by Eugenia Kuyda to replace the void left by the untimely loss of her closest friend, Roman Mazurenko. Built by feeding Roman’s text messages into a neural network to construct a bot that texted just like him, it was meant to serve as a ""digital monument"" of sorts to keep his memory alive. 






 Eventually, with the addition of more complex language models into the equation, the project soon morphed into what it is today—a personal AI that offers a space where you can safely discuss your thoughts, feelings, beliefs, experiences, memories, dreams—your “private perceptual world”. 

 But besides the immense technical and social prospects of this artificially sentient therapist of sorts, what really makes Replika impressive is the technology at its core. 



 Under the Hood 
 At Replika’s heart lies a complex autoregressive language model called GPT-3 that utilizes deep learning to produce human-like text. In this context, the term ""autoregressive"" suggests that the system learns from values (text in this case) that it has previously interacted with. 

 In layman's terms, the more you use it, the better it becomes. 

    





 Replika’s entire UX is built around the user’s interactions with a bot programmed using GPT-3. But what exactly is GPT-3 and how is it powerful enough to emulate human speech? 



 GPT-3: An Overview 
 GPT-3, or Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3, is a more advanced adaptation of Google’s Transformer. Broadly speaking, it’s a neural network architecture that helps machine learning algorithms perform tasks such as language modeling and machine translation. 

 The nodes of such a neural network represent parameters and processes which modify inputs accordingly (somewhat similar to logic and/or conditional statements in programming), while the edges or connections of the network act as signaling channels from one node to another. 

    





 Every connection in this neural network has a weight, or an importance level, which determines the flow of signals from one node to the other. In an autoregressive learning model such as GPT-3, the system receives real-time feedback and continually adjusts the weights of its connections in order to provide more accurate and relevant output. It's these weights that help a neural network ‘learn’ artificially. 

  Related: What Is Machine Learning? Google's Free Course Breaks It Down for You 

 GPT-3 uses a whopping 175 billion connection weight levels or parameters. A parameter is a calculation in a neural network that adjusts the weight of some aspect of the data, to give that aspect greater or lesser prominence in the overall calculation of the data. 

 Hailed as the ultimate autocomplete, GPT-3’s language model, which is purposed to provide predictive text, has been trained on such a vast dataset that all of Wikipedia constitutes merely 0.6 percent of its training data. 





 It includes not only things like news articles, recipes, and poetry, but also coding manuals, fanfiction, religious prophecy, guides to the mountains of Nepal, and whatever else you can imagine. 

    

 As a deep learning system, GPT-3 scours for patterns in data. To put it simply, the program has been trained on a massive collection of text which it mines for statistical regularities. These regularities, such as language conventions or general grammatical structure are often taken for granted by humans, but they’re stored as billions of weighted connections between the different nodes in GPT-3’s neural network. 






 For example, If you input the word “ear” into GPT-3, the program knows, based on the weights in its networks, that the words “ache” and “phone” are much more likely to follow than “American” or “angry”. 



 GPT-3 and Replika: A Meaningful Confluence 
 Replika is what you get when you take something like GPT-3 and distill it to address specific types of conversation. In this case, this includes the empathetic, emotional, and therapeutic aspects of a conversation. 

 While the technology behind Replika is still under development, it offers a plausible gateway to easily accessible interpersonal conversation. 

 Commenting on its usability, the creators claim that they have created a bot that not only talks but also listens. What this means for its users is that their talks with the AI are not a mere exchange of facts and information, but rather a dialogue equipped with linguistic nuances. 






 But talks with Replika aren’t just a matter of sensible dialogue. They also happen to be surprisingly meaningful and emotive in many cases. While interacting with a user, Replika’s AI ""understands"" what the user says, and finds a human response by using its predictive learning model. 

    

 As an autoregressive system, Replika learns and adapts its conversational patterns based on the user’s own way of talking to it. 

 This means that the more you use Replika, the more it trains on your own texts, and the more it becomes like you. A good proportion of users have also mentioned that they have a significant level of emotional attachment to their Replika—something that is not achieved by merely knowing ""how to talk."" 






 Replika of course goes above and beyond that. It adds depth to its conversations in the form of semantic generalization, inflective speech, and conversation tracking. Its algorithm tries to understand who you are—both in terms of your personality and emotions—and then molds the dialogue based on this information. 



 A Closer Look at the Efficacy of GPT-3 
 However, Replika’s humanness is still largely theoretical due to the operational limitations of GPT-3. As such, there is much work to be done for the AI to competently replicate and participate in human conversation. 

 Close inspections of GPT-3 still reveal clearly distinguishable errors as well as nonsensical and plain sloppy writing in some cases. Industry experts suggest that a language processing model would need to have upwards of 1 trillion weighted connections before it can be used to produce bots that are able to effectively replicate human lingo. 








 The Best is Yet to Come 
 Given that GPT-3 is already considered to be an exponential leap in years when compared to predecessors such as Microsoft’s Turing NLG, it is safe to assume that it might be a while before we come up with something better. 

 That said, with future improvements in computing, the processing power afforded by newer systems will surely narrow the gap between human and machine even further. 

 In the meantime, Replika remains a formidable product that combines the best of psychology and artificial intelligence. Its successful integration of a human-friendly UX with a state-of-the-art NLP model is indeed a testament to the immense potential of human-computer interaction technologies.

Artificial intelligence is embodied in a range of applications that can offer businesses in many industries a competitive advantage. Investment in such technologies is soaring, and analysts forecast AI spending worldwide will more than double over the next three years, exceeding US$79 billion by 2022.The effect of AI on jobs is still uncertain, but early signs suggest human workers and AI adoption will augment each other, changing the nature of work for the better.Learn more about the talent and workforce effects of AI.Read more











































To achieve the most positive AI outcomes, companies will need the right mix of talent to translate business requirements into the most efficient solutions. This will mean building and deploying AI systems, integrating them into processes and correctly interpreting the results. But early AI adopters will need to bridge a skills gap if they are to maximize the technology’s capabilities.What do leaders regard as the “most needed” roles to fill their company’s AI skills gap? What do leaders regard as the “most needed” roles to fill their company’s AI skills gap? The top four most-needed roles are “AI builders,” who are instrumental in creating AI solutions:
                    Researchers to invent new kinds of AI algorithms and systemsSoftware developers to architect and code AI systemsData scientists to analyze and extract meaningful insights from dataProject managers to ensure that AI projects are executed according to planAlso required will be “translators” who can bridge the business/tech staff divide at both the front and back ends of building AI solutions.















































































































































































































Companies in the AI game have a sense of urgency. At a time when competition for AI skills is fierce, a competitive advantage will depend on the right strategy for dealing with AI talent shortages and the changing nature of work.Early adopters should consider the following to strengthen their AI foothold.
Decide what skills are needed.AI adopters should examine their requirements closely, then consider whether they really need AI research superstars to break new ground, or if goals can be achieved with a skilled engineering team retrained to use available AI tools.Adopters should also involve the organization’s leadership early on and throughout the life cycle of AI initiatives. This will connect the company’s business models and strategy with AI system requirements and help establish metrics for project success. AI adopters also should consider using change management experts to address the challenge of integrating AI into the company’s roles and functions. These professionals, who help ensure organizations actually use new systems or processes after developing them, can be key to overcoming a significant AI integration hurdle.

















































































































































Find the right balance between hiring and reskilling.Leaders also should consider identifying and reskilling current developers, IT staff and other current employees to build the company’s AI expertise. Programs to train developers to create AI solutions and IT staff to deploy those solutions can be tailored to the organization’s specific needs. These can include training employees how to use AI systems in the course of their jobs, as well as to develop structured ways of integrating AI into their roles and functions. For their part, employees should embrace an attitude of lifelong learning and a perspective of how AI assistance may supercharge their future work.





















































































































































































































































Redesign work for the age of AI.Automation’s role extends beyond reducing headcount or optimizing processes. Organizations can use AI to free workers from repetitive or error-prone tasks, bringing their human skills of judgment, interpretation, and empathy to bear on more complex decisions. Leaders should advance a vision of what their “augmented workforce” looks like—and evolve it as their AI capabilities change. They should have a strategy for “redefining work” that lets workers with freed-up capacity create new sources of business value.

He said a union would keep pressure on management.Credit...Damien Maloney for The New York TimesBy Kate CongerJan. 4, 2021OAKLAND, Calif. — More than 400 Google engineers and other workers have formed a union, the group revealed on Monday, capping years of growing activism at one of the world’s largest companies and presenting a rare beachhead for labor organizers in staunchly anti-union Silicon Valley.The union’s creation is highly unusual for the tech industry, which has long resisted efforts to organize its largely white-collar work force. It follows increasing demands by employees at Google for policy overhauls on pay, harassment and ethics, and is likely to escalate tensions with top leadership.The new union, called the Alphabet Workers Union after Google’s parent company, Alphabet, was organized in secret for the better part of a year and elected its leadership last month. The group is affiliated with the Communications Workers of America, a union that represents workers in telecommunications and media in the United States and Canada.But unlike a traditional union, which demands that an employer come to the bargaining table to agree on a contract, the Alphabet Workers Union is a so-called minority union that represents a fraction of the company’s more than 260,000 full-time employees and contractors. Workers said it was primarily an effort to give structure and longevity to activism at Google, rather than to negotiate for a contract.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTChewy Shaw, an engineer at Google in the San Francisco Bay Area and the vice chair of the union’s leadership council, said the union was a necessary tool to sustain pressure on management so that workers could force changes on workplace issues.“Our goals go beyond the workplace questions of ‘Are people getting paid enough?’ Our issues are going much broader,” he said. “It is a time where a union is an answer to these problems.”In response, Kara Silverstein, Google’s director of people operations, said: “We’ve always worked hard to create a supportive and rewarding workplace for our work force. Of course, our employees have protected labor rights that we support. But as we’ve always done, we’ll continue engaging directly with all our employees.”The new union is the clearest sign of how thoroughly employee activism has swept through Silicon Valley over the past few years. While software engineers and other tech workers largely kept quiet in the past on societal and political issues, employees at Amazon, Salesforce, Pinterest and others have become more vocal on matters like diversity, pay discrimination and sexual harassment.Image“Our goals go beyond the workplace questions of ‘Are people getting paid enough?’” Mr. Shaw said.Credit...Damien Maloney for The New York TimesImageTimnit Gebru, an artificial intelligence researcher, said Google had fired her after she criticized biases in A.I. systems.Credit...Cody O'Loughlin for The New York TimesAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTNowhere have those voices been louder than at Google. In 2018, more than 20,000 employees staged a walkout to protest how the company handled sexual harassment. Others have opposed business decisions that they deemed unethical, such as developing artificial intelligence for the Defense Department and providing technology to Customs and Border Protection.Even so, unions have not gained traction in Silicon Valley. Many tech workers shunned them, arguing that labor groups were focused on issues like wages — not a top concern in the high-earning industry — and were not equipped to address their concerns about ethics and the role of technology in society. Labor organizers also found it difficult to corral the tech companies’ huge work forces, which are scattered around the globe.Only a few small union drives have succeeded in tech in the past. Workers at the crowdfunding site Kickstarter and at the app development platform Glitch won union campaigns last year, and a small group of contractors at a Google office in Pittsburgh unionized in 2019. Thousands of employees at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama are also set to vote on a union in the coming months.“There are those who would want you to believe that organizing in the tech industry is completely impossible,” Sara Steffens, C.W.A.’s secretary-treasurer, said of the new Google union. “If you don’t have unions in the tech industry, what does that mean for our country? That’s one reason, from C.W.A.’s point of view, that we see this as a priority.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTVeena Dubal, a law professor at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law, said the Google union was a “powerful experiment” because it brought unionization into a major tech company and skirted barriers that had prevented such organizing.“If it grows — which Google will do everything they can to prevent — it could have huge impacts not just for the workers but for the broader issues that we are all thinking about in terms of tech power in society,” she said.The union is likely to ratchet up tensions between Google engineers, who work on autonomous cars, artificial intelligence and internet search, and the company’s management. Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, and other executives have tried to come to grips with an increasingly activist work force — but have made missteps.Last month, federal officials said Google had most likely wrongly fired two employees who protested its work with immigration authorities in 2019. Timnit Gebru, a Black woman who is a respected artificial intelligence researcher, also said last month that Google had fired her after she criticized the company’s approach to minority hiring and the biases built into A.I. systems. Her departure set off a storm of criticism about Google’s treatment of minority employees.“These companies find it a bone in their throat to even have a small group of people who say, ‘We work at Google and have another point of view,’” said Nelson Lichtenstein, the director of the Center for the Study of Work, Labor and Democracy at the University of California, Santa Barbara. “Google might well succeed in decimating any organization that comes to the floor.”AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe Alphabet Workers Union, which represents employees in Silicon Valley and cities like Cambridge, Mass., and Seattle, gives protection and resources to workers who join. Those who opt to become members will contribute 1 percent of their total compensation to the union to fund its efforts.Over the past year, the C.W.A. has pushed to unionize white-collar tech workers. (The NewsGuild, a union that represents New York Times employees, is part of the C.W.A.) The drive focused initially on employees at video game companies, who often work grueling hours and face layoffs.In late 2019, C.W.A. organizers began meeting with Google employees to discuss a union drive, workers who attended the meetings said. Some employees were receptive and signed cards to officially join the union last summer. In December, the Alphabet Workers Union held elections to select a seven-person executive council.But several Google employees who had previously organized petitions and protests at the company objected to the C.W.A.’s overtures. They said they had declined to join because they worried that the effort had sidelined experienced organizers and played down the risks of organizing as it recruited members.ImageGoogle employees staged a walkout in 2018 to protest how the company handled sexual harassment.Credit...Bebeto Matthews/Associated PressAmr Gaber, a Google software engineer who helped organize the 2018 walkout, said C.W.A. officials were dismissive of other labor groups that had supported Google workers during a December 2019 phone call with him and others.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“They are more concerned about claiming turf than the needs of the workers who were on the phone call,” Mr. Gaber said. “As a long-term labor organizer and brown man, that’s not the type of union I want to build.”The C.W.A. said it had been selected by Google workers to help organize the union and had not elbowed its way in. “It’s really the workers who chose,” Ms. Steffens of C.W.A. said.Traditional unions typically enroll a majority of a work force and petition a state or federal labor board like the National Labor Relations Board to hold an election. If they win the vote, they can bargain with their employer on a contract. A minority union allows employees to organize without first winning a formal vote before the N.L.R.B.The C.W.A. has used this model to organize groups in states where it said labor laws were unfavorable, like the Texas State Employees Union and the United Campus Workers in Tennessee.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTThe structure also gives the union the latitude to include Google contractors, who outnumber full-time workers and who would be excluded from a traditional union. Some Google employees have considered establishing a minority or solidarity union for several years, and ride-hailing drivers have formed similar groups.Although they will not be able to negotiate a contract, the Alphabet Workers Union can use other tactics to pressure Google into changing its policies, labor experts said. Minority unions often turn to public pressure campaigns and lobby legislative or regulatory bodies to influence employers.“We’re going to use every tool that we can to use our collective action to protect people who we think are being discriminated against or retaliated against,” Mr. Shaw said.Members cited the recent N.L.R.B. finding on the firing of two employees and the exit of Dr. Gebru, the prominent researcher, as reasons to broaden its membership and publicly step up its efforts.“Google is making it all the more clear why we need this now,” said Auni Ahsan, a software engineer at Google and an at-large member of the union’s executive council. “Sometimes the boss is the best organizer.”Kate Conger is a technology reporter in San Francisco, covering privacy, policy and labor.

Traditionally, policymakers and urban planners haven’t had access to city data that can reveal complex patterns and relationships between factors that influence urban development. In some cases, data is too laborious or costly to measure at frequent time intervals, and in others, unexpected or unforeseen circumstances such as a pandemic like COVID-19 are responsible for invalidating earlier forecasts.
But this is changing rapidly, with emerging technologies unlocking new possibilities for urban planning. Advances in emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning can help us understand our cities better and derive useful insights from real-time data collected through automated models that provide a much closer view of the situation on-ground compared to traditional approaches.Play VideoPlaySkip BackwardSkip ForwardUnmuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration 50:00Loaded: 1.03%00:00Stream Type LIVESeek to live, currently behind liveLIVERemaining Time -50:00 1xPlayback RateChaptersChaptersDescriptionsdescriptions off, selectedCaptionscaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedAudio Trackdefault, selectedPicture-in-PictureFullscreenThis is a modal window.Beginning of dialog window.

These insights can properly assess public interests and help policymakers in making decisions that are more sustainable.
In this article, we will explore some sophisticated ways in which Artificial Intelligence can enhance Urban Planning.

Improve road infrastructure with AI-based traffic systems

Narrow roads in cities can be a tremendous inconvenience. The combination of small country roads and heavy trucks, sometimes driven by workers unfamiliar with the region, has resulted in countless instances of large vehicles running off the road, rolling over on narrow turns, or being involved in accidents. Problems like traffic and congestion are also common, especially in urban centers.
The obvious solution to solve this is to upgrade the existing road infrastructure or build new highways but accurately predicting their need and maintenance schedule can be difficult. This can be fixed with the help of AI-based traffic and mobility systems. These systems collect and analyze traffic data, generate solutions, and apply them to traffic infrastructure. AI-based traffic systems work by collecting data from connected traffic systems, which provides input about live traffic or years of historical traffic behavior.
These systems can also take into account data about a host of other potential problems that can impact roads and traffic in the future. In order to understand this data, such systems use machine learning models to process, analyze, and learn about traffic infrastructure. The AI then uses those insights to suggest solutions that can enable authorities to build better and safer infrastructure.
A deep learning algorithm can also help in successfully predicting maintenance requirements of road infrastructure and thus prevent expensive and unplanned failures.
Cambridge-based AI company, Intellegens, announced details of a proof of concept project with global construction and infrastructure group Skanska, which could save Hampshire County Council in excess of £100,000 per annum on road drainage and gully maintenance work. In a trial, drainage data of Hampshire County was passed through a deep learning solution which turned it into a series of models that could enable stakeholders to predict where drainage issues were most likely to occur.
Another example is the automatic recognition of road damage by ARCADIS in which images are taken with a camera of a certain road section using annual images from CycloMedia or with a GoPro. These images are then read into a custom-developed software module, which is can determine the exact location of the defect, the type of defect, the extent of the defect, and even recommended a maintenance measure. Using historical data, this model can also calculate the deterioration of roads, allowing road authorities to draw up a predictive maintenance plan.

Forecasting population

Having accurate population forecasts helps the government with long-term infrastructure planning, particularly where land resources are scarce and the infrastructure is expensive and may take many years to build.
Forecasts try to estimate the rate of population growth, but anticipating the numbers and characteristics of the future population is very difficult as it can be influenced by unforeseen circumstances like a pandemic, war, and other mass catastrophes. Death rates can even decrease with advances in medicine and healthcare. Even the United Nations has issued multiple projections of the future world population and revises it every two years. The revisions from the projections released just two years earlier look small but become significant when accumulated over several decades.
Mathematical models can be inadequate in including all the datasets that can influence population growth and making accurate predictions. On the other hand, the cost of collecting the data required for the task is huge. To tackle these problems, machine learning algorithms can be brought to the rescue.
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning have gained considerable prominence over the last decade fuelled by a number of high-profile applications. It is used for forecasting too and can be very much efficient in forecasting population with automated collection and analysis of a broad and diverse set of data. These algorithms are used to quickly analyze huge and diverse datasets that can influence the growth of the population and increase the accuracy of forecasts by reducing human errors. 

Water resource management

The vast networks of buried water, wastewater, and stormwater infrastructure are the veins and arteries feeding our people, our cities, and protecting our environment. Without sustainable and viable water, waste, and stormwater solutions, our quality of life is in peril. Society’s water, wastewater, and stormwater systems have always played significant roles in eliminating disease, safeguarding the environment, and protecting communities.
There is a significant strain on water utilities’ ability to continue delivering critical services to customers while operating with limited resources. But using AI in water resource management can make way for need-based water supply and water-saving systems.
Utilities can deploy smart meters, sensors, and other IoT hardware that will inevitably result in the collection of huge amounts of data about water consumption of a region and can also detect leakages to recommend quick action. Automated analysis of this data using Machine Learning and AI will enable building an efficient water system, optimizing current water resources, infrastructure planning for water structures, and give necessary flexibility to handle unforeseen circumstances.

Problems with sewage systems

Sewers are the most important part of sewerage systems. They are laid below the ground and are difficult to repair, often taking up significant time and resources. Smart hardware like small, rugged, low power sensors that are able to communicate with specially-designed machine learning and AI solutions can help authorities to minimize expensive repairs by automatically detecting abnormalities in real-time and recommending timely actions.
Such smart systems getting data from smart sensors installed underground can also significantly reduce the total costs to inspect and assess underground infrastructure. With the help of these systems, utilities can monitor real-time performance and AI models can predict when and where problems may arise.
External data such as weather and tides or migration trends can also be incorporated in the solutions to increases accuracy over the long-term and to actively operate and maintain these sewage systems. These smart systems can also aid in future planning for sewage systems when the data sets become large enough to apply advanced artificial intelligence tools.
AI can also be used to help residents and organizations track their waste in real-time and send notifications to users to correctly sort their waste whenever irregularities are detected.

Smarter and safer driving

The safety of passengers, pedestrians, and drivers has always been the top concern for the transportation industry and AI can bring us closer to ensuring that. Taking advantage of AI models not only decreases accidents or mishaps caused by human errors but can also monitor safety regulation compliance and help drivers in vehicle maintenance by sending them timely alerts.
Using data analytics in logistics, on the other hand, provides a data-driven view on routes and driving behavior, which upgrades the transportation planning process, increase efficiency, and makes the process safer.
Traffic prediction models can allow users to do smarter route planning using historical as well as real-time traffic data, road and weather conditions, and even information about sporting events or construction in the area.
What lies ahead?
Artificial Intelligence is quickly revolutionizing every field from food to aviation. Several of the applications of AI in Urban Planning suggested above are even being utilized in the real-world albeit at a small scale. Some applications can be scaled up quickly to be utilized in many parts of the world.
But the barriers, especially for developing countries, to applying these technologies can still seem daunting. Investments needed to facilitate the collection of data to train AI models can be huge and the upgradation of existing infrastructure can be discouraging.
Under these circumstances, several successful examples of smart cities leading the way could be the boom AI needs to transform urban planning and our lives along with it.
