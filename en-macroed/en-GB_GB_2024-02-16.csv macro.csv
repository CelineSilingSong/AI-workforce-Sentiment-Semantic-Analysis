However, the fourth industrial revolution, characterised by digital technologies and AI, is complicating the historical narrative: global studies have highlighted its impact on higher-wage earners.AI Is Projected to Have the Greatest Impact on Knowledge WorkersThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has predicted that almost 40 per cent of global employment will be exposed to AI, with the number climbing to 60 per cent in advanced economies due to their proportion of highly skilled jobs. These predictions are in line with other global studies indicating that “knowledge workers” will be most prone to automation and augmentation. With reference to the emergence of generative AI (GenAI) and the advent of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, the International Labour Organization (ILO) has predicted that high-skilled, white-collar occupations (such as managers, chief executives, and science and engineering professionals) are likely to face considerable exposure to AI’s recent progress.These occupations, previously assumed to be safe from job displacement, have recently come under scrutiny due to GenAI’s startling ability to automate the type of tasks that are part of many white-collar jobs: analysing large datasets, information synthesis and content generation, all at astonishing speeds. Addressing the impact of GenAI, industry projections indicate that it could lead to the loss of 300 million full-time jobs, and that half of today’s work tasks will be automated somewhere between 2030 and 2060.However, caveats remain. Limitations (such as the speed at which AI is being adopted, and bottlenecks due to certain skills being more resistant to automation) challenge the accuracy of these estimates. So too do rapid technological advancements: an update to a decade-old study that estimated up to 47 per cent of jobs in the United States were at risk indicates that, instead, lower-skilled workers actually stand to benefit most from GenAI.These findings are echoed elsewhere too. A study of customer-support agents found that when call-centre operators used GenAI-based assistants in their work they became 14 per cent more productive. There was also a 34 per cent increase in productivity for the lowest-skilled agents, who moved up the learning curve faster with GenAI assistance. Another study on the use of LLMs, involving more than 750 business consultants, reached a similar conclusion.There is also agreement that most jobs that are partially exposed to automation are more likely to be transformed than fully automated, emphasising the potential of augmentation in many occupations.Asia’s Unique Labour-Market Environment Warrants a Closer LookAlthough some degree of consensus can be found in studies from around the globe, most of the above insights were derived from research that tapped into the O*NET database. This is a comprehensive, standardised, occupation-specific set of descriptors covering the entire US economy that is generally applicable to many Western economies. However, the data may have limited application in Asia, not least due to the continent’s unique labour-market environment and regional concerns.In South Asia, large parts of the workforce are in the informal sector, where employees don’t have fixed working hours and wages. As such, their data are not adequately captured. Informal work in Asia rose from an average of 50 per cent in the 2000s to 60 per cent over the period between 2010 and 2016. In India alone about 90 per cent of the workforce engages in informal work, notwithstanding fast economic growth and technology adoption. Data capture aside, there are pertinent concerns over the lower wages and protections for workers in the informal sector, as well as the knock-on effect for productivity.The growth of the informal sector in Asia can be seen through the increasing prominence of digital labour platforms, which mediate jobs that are short-term, task-based and on-demand. Increasingly, studies have highlighted the emergence of “microtasks” (image and data annotation, labelling, categorisation and data processing, for example) on such platforms. These tasks, which power the development of AI systems in advanced economies, are often outsourced to workers in South Asia and Africa. Studies highlight how some microtasks can be harmful to workers’ mental health (such as reviewing disturbing images or videos) and are often unrelated to their educational qualifications. More importantly, the poor quality of such jobs can lead to the deskilling of workers and the creation of low-end service economies.While digitalisation can create jobs and raise productivity and competitiveness, there are concerns that GenAI could imminently absorb roles in the business-process outsourcing (BPO) sector in the Philippines. BPO is a key sector: it employs about 1.3 million workers in call centres, knowledge-process outsourcing and back offices, software development, game development and the like, generating $30 billion a year (or 7 per cent of GDP). More than half of employers in information technology BPO in the country – 59 per cent – reported that they had adopted “4IR technologies” (referring to data exchange technologies, cyber-physical systems, the internet of things, AI, cloud computing and cognitive computing).With the forecast that at least 1.1 million Filipinos will have lost their jobs as a result of AI by 2028, Senator Imee Marcos has filed a resolution to the Senate of the Philippines to review AI use in the country’s factories and call centres. While more jobs in developed markets are exposed to automation than in emerging markets, it is predicted that nearly 20 per cent of jobs in the Philippines – and more than 10 per cent in India – could be lost to AI.More Efforts Are Needed to Achieve a Balanced Distributional EffectHistorical evidence suggests that technological advancements can boost wages without reducing the labour share. While some jobs will inevitably be lost or transformed, the impact will be counterbalanced by the beneficial productivity effect and the creation of novel job opportunities; this can lead to market expansion and the emergence of new sectors through technological innovation. AI may have the potential to create positive impact on workplace safety but concerns persist regarding job displacement, job quality, income distribution and gendered impact.Asia’s unique labour-market environment means that low- and middle-income countries in the region need to act urgently to realise the potential of digitally driven jobs as a step towards improved sustainable development. Failure to act promptly could exacerbate digital and wage inequality, and ramp up social tensions. Policymakers need to consider the current and longer-term needs of the workforce and economy, taking into account ways to integrate the future of work with economic and industrial strategies. While new jobs are being created through the development and adoption of new AI technologies, governments need to ensure that their economic, education and skills strategies work in a cohesive way to bring about structural transformation, sustainable growth and good work.Given the significant presence of BPO jobs in Asia, one focus area could be to encourage and incentivise employers to support middle- and low-skilled workers in benefitting the most from AI technologies, putting the emphasis on tech adoption and upskilling. Education and skills strategies also need to go hand in hand with the needs of the economy to ensure that the skills and talent pipeline is robust. People should be able to not only use and adopt technology, but also innovate and create value-added businesses.A Multifaceted, Participatory Approach Is NeededAcknowledging the dual nature of AI’s impact, researchers have proposed policy measures to manage disruption effectively. Existing recommendations include strategic workforce planning, lifelong learning systems and social safety nets. Other integral components of policy suggestions are the enforcement of principles for the use of AI, support for low-wage workers and consultation between employers and workers.AI’s impact on the future of work will depend on the paths and decisions that policymakers take. The IMF findings revealed that, although advanced economies face greater exposure to AI, they are also more prepared for the disruption that it will bring. Countries such as Singapore and the US, which are top of IMF’s AI Preparedness Index, are poised to take advantage of the AI wave thanks to their consistent and strategic investment in human capital, digital infrastructure, innovation and AI governance. As such, policymakers in other countries should explore ways to enable a systematic approach to developing human capital for the fourth industrial revolution, not least by focusing on linking up education and skills with industrial strategies.Given the rapid development of AI, it is paramount that multi-stakeholder groups come together – and this includes a voice for workers, who are so often on the receiving end of technology adoption. Countries should put concerted effort into uncovering real-life insights on the ground and take a participatory approach to engage workers, employers and unions alike. The disruptive nature of technology warrants this multifaceted and inclusive approach so that all of us can benefit from its transformational potential.Lead image: GettyArticle TagsArtificial IntelligenceScience & InnovationTechFuture of Work",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The UK’s artificial intelligence minister has offered to work with the EU on regulation, and said that London would likely take an approach to copyright in AI that was “reasonably close” to Brussels. 
Jonathan Berry took part in a Brussels discussion last week on AI regulation including MEP Axel Voss, rapporteur on the EU’s AI Act, which is now close to being agreed. 
While the UK is still not close to enacting similar legislation, and has instead told existing regulators to draw up rules on AI, Berry said the two sides should work with each other and trade information as the technology evolves. 
“I think there are really valuable opportunities for shared learning here,” he told the event, held on 15 February, co-hosted by Voss and the UK’s EU mission.

Vocal assessments. Gamified tests. CV scanners. These are some of the tools companies use to screen candidates with artificial intelligence recruiting software. Job applicants face these machine prompts – and AI decides whether they are a good match or fall short.Businesses are increasingly relying on them. A late-2023 IBM survey of more than 8,500 global IT professionals showed 42% of companies were using AI screening ""to improve recruiting and human resources"". Another 40% of respondents were considering integrating the technology.Many leaders across the corporate world hoped AI recruiting tech would end biases in the hiring process. Yet in some cases, the opposite is happening. Some experts say these tools are inaccurately screening some of the most qualified job applicants – and concerns are growing the software may be excising the best candidates.""We haven't seen a whole lot of evidence that there's no bias here… or that the tool picks out the most qualified candidates,"" says Hilke Schellmann, US-based author of the Algorithm: How AI Can Hijack Your Career and Steal Your Future, and an assistant professor of journalism at New York University. She believes the biggest risk such software poses to jobs is not machines taking workers' positions, as is often feared – but rather preventing them from getting a role at all. Untold harmSome qualified job candidates have already found themselves at odds with these hiring platforms.In one high-profile case in 2020, UK-based make-up artist Anthea Mairoudhiou said her company told her to re-apply for her role after being furloughed during the pandemic. She was evaluated both based on past performance and via an AI-screening programme, HireVue. She says she ranked well in the skills evaluation – but after the AI tool scored her body language poorly, she was out of a job for good. (HireVue, the firm in question, removed its facial analysis function in 2021.) Other workers have filed complaints against similar platforms, says Schellmann.AlamyMany selection algorithms are trained on one type of employee – which means candidates with different backgrounds or credentials may be filtered out (Credit: Alamy)She adds job candidates rarely ever know if these tools are the sole reason companies reject them – by and large, the software doesn't tell users how they've been evaluated. Yet she says there are many glaring examples of systemic flaws.In one case, one user who'd been screened out submitted the same application but tweaked the birthdate to make themselves younger. With this change, they landed an interview. At another company, an AI resume screener had been trained on CVs of employees already at the firm, giving people extra marks if they listed ""baseball"" or ""basketball"" – hobbies that were linked to more successful staff, often men. Those who mentioned ""softball"" – typically women – were downgraded.Marginalised groups often ""fall through the cracks, because they have different hobbies, they went to different schools"", says Schellmann.In some cases, biased selection criteria is clear – like ageism or sexism – but in others, it is opaque. In her research, Schellmann applied to a call centre job, to be screened by AI. Then, she logged in from the employer's side. She'd received a high rating in the interview, despite speaking nonsense German when she was supposed to be speaking English, but received a poor rating for her actual relevant credentials on her LinkedIn profile. She worries the negative effects will spread as the technology does. ""One biased human hiring manager can harm a lot of people in a year, and that's not great,"" she says. ""But an algorithm that is maybe used in all incoming applications at a large company… that could harm hundreds of thousands of applicants."" 'No-one knows exactly where the harm is'""The problem [is] no-one knows exactly where the harm is,"" she explains. And, given that companies have saved money by replacing human HR staff with AI – which can process piles of resumes in a fraction of the time – she believes firms may have little motivation to interrogate kinks in the machine. One biased human hiring manager can harm a lot of people in a year, and that's not great. But an algorithm that is maybe used in all incoming applications at a large company… that could harm hundreds of thousands of applicants – Hilke SchellmanFrom her research, Schellmann is also concerned screening-software companies are ""rushing"" underdeveloped, even flawed products to market to cash in on demand. ""Vendors are not going to come out publicly and say our tool didn't work, or it was harmful to people"", and companies who have used them remain ""afraid that there's going to be a gigantic class action lawsuit against them"".It's important to get this tech right, says Sandra Wachter, professor of technology and regulation at the University of Oxford's Internet Institute.""Having AI that is unbiased and fair is not only the ethical and legally necessary thing to do, it is also something that makes a company more profitable,"" she says. ""There is a very clear opportunity to allow AI to be applied in a way so it makes fairer, and more equitable decisions that are based on merit and that also increase the bottom line of a company.""  Wachter is working to help companies identify bias through the co-creation of the Conditional Demographic Disparity test, a publicly available tool which ""acts as an alarm system that notifies you if your algorithm is biased. It then gives you the opportunity to figure out which [hiring] decision criteria cause this inequality and allows you to make adjustments to make your system fairer and more accurate"", she says. Since its development in 2020, Amazon and IBM are among the businesses that have implemented it. Schellmann, meanwhile, is calling for industry-wide ""guardrails and regulation"" from governments or non-profits to ensure current problems do not persist. If there is no intervention now, she fears AI could make the workplace of the future more unequal than before.Artificial intelligenceFeaturesHow we workTechnology of BusinessWork culture",['https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0hbx9q4.jpg'],2024-02-16T17:31:01.564Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Generative AI is one of the most transformative technologies that humans have ever had access to. And the impact of this new technology will be felt right across organizations – including, of course, in the HR function. According to Gartner, 76 percent of HR leaders believe that if their organization does not adopt AI solutions, including generative AI, in the next 12–24 months, they will lag behind those companies that do. So, this is clearly a topic on HR leaders’ minds.


But how exactly might generative AI influence the work of HR? Here are my top predictions.

Increasing HR Productivity With Generative AI
Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT will revolutionize so much of what HR does. It will streamline processes such as recruitment, onboarding, personal development, and day-to-day HR administrative tasks. Plus, it will be used to automatically create content, analyze data, and generate reports. In short, generative AI can unlock significant productivity gains – potentially up to 30 percent, according to that same Gartner report.

PROMOTED
Providing A Better, More Personalized Service To Employees
Generative AI isn’t just about behind-the-scenes improvements; it can also lead to new employee-facing tools that provide a better employee experience.

A super-simple example is HR chatbots. These conversational AIs can be used to aid recruitment, assist with onboarding tasks, and generally answer routine employee questions. Generative AI, therefore, enables HR teams to provide more self-service applications – but in a more intuitive, more personal, and more helpful way than ever before. With their advanced language capabilities, generative AI chatbots can understand context as well as content – making them infinitely better than the basic chatbots of old. And, of course, these tools can be available 24/7, on-demand. Best of all, by not having to manually respond to routine queries, HR professionals will have more bandwidth for more complex issues and situations that absolutely require the human touch.

Generative AI can also enable a more personalized approach to serving employees. For example, HR “co-pilots” can help guide employees on aspects such as career development, learning opportunities, reminders about personal goals, or even flagging when an employee might be stressed, in need of some time off, or in need of additional support. What’s more, Generative AI can be used to create customized learning and development plans or onboarding plans for each individual employee.

Managing The Human Implications of Digital Transformation
Of course, another thing that HR functions will be grappling with is the impact of generative AI on the wider workforce. This isn’t just about supporting the workforce through job augmentation and job displacement – important as that is – it’s also about equipping people with the skills needed to thrive in the generative AI era. HR teams will need to guide business leaders accordingly, striking a balance between the efficiency boosts that generative AI can provide and the human qualities that will still be essential for businesses. For instance, we can expect that human qualities and abilities like strategic thinking, complex problem solving, creativity, and emotional intelligence will be more in demand in the future.

Enabling HR To Play a Deeper Role In Shaping The Organization’s Future
By automating many of the daily, repetitive, and simpler HR tasks, generative AI frees up human HR professionals to focus their time on more complex or bigger-picture tasks. This, in turn, allows the HR team to become a more insightful, more strategic partner within the business. With all organizations facing a massive wave of digital transformation, the need for HR to play a leading role in navigating business change has never been more pressing. In other words, generative AI can help HR functions add even more value to the organization.
HR Can Lead The Way
With many business leaders unsure where to start the digital transformation, there’s an opportunity for HR to lead by example – by embracing generative AI and digital transformation in general.
Of course, this is easier said than done. But here are some pointers to help you on that journey:
· Plan for workforce impact. Consider carefully how generative AI – and AI in general – will impact the workforce, the kinds of skills that will be essential to future business success, and how HR can support people through the changes.
· Practice empathy. Change is scary, so as you lead the way in navigating change and uncertainty, do so with compassion and empathy.
· Embrace new tools. Learn from how other organizations have successfully implemented generative AI and find your own use cases – ideally a mixture of longer-term, more strategic ways to deploy generative AI, and some shorter-term quick-win projects that can help to build knowledge and enthusiasm.
· Publicize your successes. When generative AI adds value to HR’s work, tell that story within the business. Showcase the wins, big and small, to help increase buy-in across the business.
Generative AI heralds a new frontier in HR, offering a transformative pathway for enhancing efficiency and shaping the future of work, positioning HR leaders at the helm of digital innovation and organizational progress.

Governments and public service agencies understand the enormous potential of generative AI. Recent research by McGuire Research Services for Avanade, shows 82% of government employees are using AI on a daily or weekly basis, while 84% of organisations plan to increase their IT investments by up to 24% to take advantage of AI.
Many see AI as a driving force for a sector that has often lagged behind on technology, but which now has an opportunity to take a leadership position. What’s more, the technology is available right now.
Microsoft Copilot brings the power of large language models (LLMs) directly into the applications agencies already use, enabling powerful productivity tools to be harnessed through simple words and phrases. It can bring vast pools of data together from Word documents and Excel spreadsheets, calendars and emails, chats and meeting notes, along with Power BI reports. It can then use this data to generate new content and deliver information and insights when most needed: as a brief summary, an answer to a question or the first draft of a detailed proposal or report.
In a sector where huge amounts of time and energy are spent on mundane and repetitive tasks, the impact is dramatic. A copilot can help employees by prepopulating digital forms with data from word documents, then automating reminders and follow-up communications, summarising meetings and drafting paperwork. According to Avanade’s research, improving efficiency is the number one objective for AI in government right now, according to 44% of respondents. It’s estimated that by automating mundane tasks, workers might gain up to 20 hours per week to focus on activities where their intervention counts.
Yet this is only the beginning, given Copilot’s ability for content synthesis and summarisation. Take case workers in a government agency. Right now, simply pulling in all the information on a specific case is challenging, particularly with multiple workers or agencies involved. Copilot can summarise data from submitted applications, case notes, email or social media interactions, then synthesise it with existing policies and guidance to give workers the best available information and advice, complete with references where required. There are also obvious benefits for new workers. After all, nobody has all the relevant knowledge and resources at their fingertips from day one.
Transforming data to informed decisionsCopilot can also help teams develop a more data-driven approach to strategy and decision-making. Just by asking simple questions, workers can extract insights from a range of complex data sources, isolating trends and patterns, or even getting recommendations on potential actions. This could help supervisors generate reports to highlight where their teams need to focus resources, or recruiting teams to fill new roles to cover changes in requirements or demand. It could aid project managers in identifying how climate events or emerging financial pressures might impact budgets and delivery timelines.  
What’s more, using Copilot could transform the way governments and agencies interact and communicate with citizens, enabling them to generate more relevant, personalised content at scale. It becomes easier to target and tailor communications to specific groups and individuals, enabling them to access public services in their own language. And by helping workers generate everything from reports and requirement documents to statements of work, speeches and policy proposals, a copilot can assist them in delivering high-quality work in less time.
Getting up to speed with Generative AI takes work and vision, but this is where Avanade can help. With its established expertise in Microsoft technologies, including generative AI and data management, Avanade is uniquely equipped to help agencies and organisations work through potential use cases and workflows. Along with the supporting technical architecture. With the right strategy in place, the time and cost savings could be significant, and the potential for improvement stellar.

Well, you certainly aren’t alone, but depending on your industry, you might have nothing to worry about at all.Given the rise in popularity of platforms like ChatGPT and Google Bard, it’s safe to assume that employees around the world are concerned about the longevity of their careers. After all, these tools have been proven to seriously improve productivity when it comes to a wide range of tasks performed in the workplace.But is AI actually replacing jobs in the business world today? In this guide, we’ll explore which roles are at risk, how widespread AI job replacements actually are, and what might be holding back advancements in the technology.

Which Jobs Is AI Replacing?Our research into the Impact of Technology on the Workplace solicited a lot of information, not the least important of which was the kinds of jobs and tasks that are being replaced by AI.Given the generative nature of AI platforms on the market today, some jobs seem riper for replacement than others. However, our research actually found the opposite, with writing (63%), design (51%), and language translation (50%) representing the tasks where AI tools have no impact on removing job roles.However, other roles were not so lucky. Supply chain optimization, for example, was the most likely to be replaced by AI, with 72% of businesses admitting that had removed at least some jobs to perform the task. Other roles at the bottom of the list include legal research (65%), financial analysis (64%), and predictive maintenance on fixed assets (65%).As for why, the report had some notable insights around the reasoning for job roles being replaced by AI:“This is likely nothing more than a bottom-line decision, with these time-consuming, complex data-processing roles costing a lot of money to fill with well-trained professionals. Subsequently, being able to replace them with an automated system will save the company the most money, which is why they’re willing to risk forgoing a full-time employee to make it happen.” – Jennifer McIlveen, managing editor of Tech.coAs is often the case, the decisions on which roles are replaced by AI is largely driven by money. Subsequently, understanding how widespread AI job replacement can help you plan for the future.      How Widespread Are AI Job Replacements?Artificial intelligence (AI) and the many platforms that have arisen from its advancement over the last few years are providing businesses with the tools to tackle big problems. In many cases, these services are streamlining and even automating roles, which means that some jobs are being replaced.But how widespread is this change? Our research found that AI isn’t influencing job replacement nearly as much as you’d think, with only 4% of businesses saying that AI has had an extensive impact on replacing job roles. Even better, a whopping 53% of businesses surveyed noted that AI has had no impact on removing job roles.“The problem isn’t dire just yet. Obviously, technology and AI have begun having an effect on job roles, but for the majority of professionals, there’s plenty of time before the need to sound any alarms.” – Jennifer McIlveen, managing editor of Tech.coSimply put, if you’re worried about your job being replaced by AI, you probably have some time before you need to start updating your resume, particularly because the AI platforms on the market now are far from perfect.      What Is Keeping AI Job Replacement Low?Considering AI platforms have become so popular and productivity over such a short period of time, it might be hard to understand exactly why job replacement isn’t higher. Don’t get us wrong, we’re happy to global economy isn’t crumbling due to this new technology, but what is keeping AI job replacement so low?Well, according to our research, trust in AI isn’t very high right now, particularly when it comes to providing false information. In fact, 49% of businesses surveyed said that they were concerned about the risk of large language AI models generating false information.Subsequently, most businesses don’t feel comfortable turning over their entire operation to an AI that makes mistakes, which means that there are still plenty of jobs and skills that won’t be replaced in the near future.      Which Job Skills Are Still Valued?While some roles and tasks are eliminated by AI, there are still some valuable skills that recruiters, business owners, and managers are looking for when it comes to new employees, and they are some of the most human skills you can imagine.“Those still worried about AI taking their job, or worse, preventing them from finding a new one, will likely be reassured by Tech.co’s findings on what hiring managers consider to be the most valuable skills in a new employee.” – Jennifer McIlveen, managing editor of Tech.coCommunication, problem solving, and time management, for instance, were at the top of the list, with 98% of respondents noting these skills as at least moderately important when it comes to hiring. People management (91%) and networking (90%) were also quite notable in regard to these kinds of valuable skills.Perhaps more importantly, the value of AI skills in the workplace hasn’t taken off yet either. In fact, only 43% of respondents said that AI expertise was at least moderately important to the hiring decision, the lowest score across our research.

Is artificial intelligence coming for your banking job? That depends, experts say.
The more senior you are, the less likely your role will see an impact from AI. Generative AI technologies are much more likely to impact entry-level roles, according to research from Gartner. About 52% of entry level individual contributor positions will be impacted by generative AI, compared to 16% of first level managers and 17% of mid-level managers, Gartner finds. By the time you reach the executive level, that percentage shrinks even further. Just 3% of senior management (think: CEO, COO) are set to be impacted by AI technology.
AI is never going to fully replace human employees, and is widely expected to be a boon for the workplace. About 30% of the hours employees currently work will be automated by 2030, according to a report from McKinsey. This will free up some workers to focus on more strategic projects. But it will require some employees to embrace new skills — particularly those working in customer service and office support.
But why, exactly, are certain roles set to be affected more significantly than others? Below, we broke down which roles will be the most impacted by AI and the trends bank employees can expect over the next few years.

Entry-Level Jobs Will Experience the Most Significant Change
Less experienced workers will see the most impact from artificial intelligence. In some cases, certain tasks or responsibilities could be entirely automated, says Agustín Rubini, director analyst in the Financial Services and Banking team at Gartner.
“AI doesn’t replace jobs, AI replaces tasks,” he says. “The jobs that typically a junior person does, they have more tasks. Eighty percent of your tasks can be automated.”
This isn’t always a bad thing, Rubini adds. AI can open up new job opportunities for employees or make onerous tasks less difficult, freeing up time for more interesting pursuits.
“What you end up having is a worker who is being helped by IT to do some of their tasks, so they’re going to have to distribute their time in a different way,” he says.
However, while generative AI tools are getting smarter, they still aren’t very good at dealing with complicated people problems. There will always be a need for customer service jobs — but AI may be used to handle more basic queries or keep track of worker productivity.
Across the board, individual contributors are much more likely to use artificial intelligence than top managers. AI is “doing activities on a computer rather than being face to face with people,” Rubini says.

AI Will Create New Jobs at Banks
Big banks are rapidly developing AI technology — in some cases even outpacing tech companies.
For example, five big banks including JPMorgan Chase and TD Bank, published 67% of all the AI research done between 2017 and 2023, according to a report from Evident, a platform that tracks AI adoption in financial services. Capital One, Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and TD Bank filed for 94% of the AI patents in that same time period, the report found.
In some cases, banks are poaching tech talent from Big Tech companies. Roughly 68% of leaders say they are hiring for general AI expert roles, Gartner research found. The next highest role they’re hiring for is data scientists (57%).

And many are also investing in upskilling their current workforces. Ally Bank, for example, has a program specifically focused on improving workers’ fluency with AI, says Sathish Muthukrishnan, the bank’s chief information, data and digital officer. The bank has its own proprietary, cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) platform called Ally.ai.
The AI fluency program gives workers the opportunity to learn more about the bank’s tools and policies surrounding AI. They also focus on how employees can incorporate AI into their work, and addresses common challenges and questions.
“We have several versions of training that we allocate and make available for our employees,” Muthukrishnan says. “The goal is to drive AI fluency for our organization.”
The drive for digital transformation needs to come from within the bank, Muthukrishnan says. Investing in developing current employees who already know your business and culture, is a good way.
“We want fair and equitable access to technology and more important AI. That should start from within,” Muthukrishnan says. “You have to give opportunities for internal employees and create a culture of a learning organization.”

AI Can Save Time on Difficult Tasks
Right now, the biggest way employees are seeing the impact of generative AI is by using large language models to synthesize information. Ally, for example, has used generative AI to help write more concise FAQs for the bank’s website, creating a more streamlined experience for customers, Muthukrishnan says.
“The time it takes to sift through information and arrive at an answer is considerably reduced, their ability to manage FAQs is so simple now,” he adds. Tools like ChatGPT can also help to write emails or other communications.
Generative AI could also be used to synthesize and transcribe information from earnings calls to create a summary, Muthukrishnan says. The tools save Ally’s investor relations teams tons of time when compiling information for earnings reports.
“It’s about how you apply the technology,” he says.



Every Bank is Different
Remember: No two banks’ AI strategies are the same. The impact of AI felt on everyday workers will likely vary greatly from organization to organization. Community banks, for example, may be slower to implement new technologies than mid-sized or large banks. However, community banks are still investing in these technologies at a rapid pace.

There are likely business opportunities that can be pursued using AI at every level of the bank, says Sophia Velastegui, chief product officer at Aptiv and the former chief technology officer for AI at Microsoft.
“Banks will need to evaluate jobs and divisions to uncover where the biggest business opportunities are for AI to provide a competitive advantage,” she says. “The real question is, what are key areas where both traditional and generative AI can assist?”

Late last week, OpenAI announced a new generative AI system named Sora, which produces short videos from text prompts. While Sora is not yet available to the public, the high quality of the sample outputs published so far has provoked both excited and concerned reactions.
The sample videos published by OpenAI, which the company says were created directly by Sora without modification, show outputs from prompts like “photorealistic closeup video of two pirate ships battling each other as they sail inside a cup of coffee” and “historical footage of California during the gold rush”. 



At first glance, it is often hard to tell they are generated by AI, due to the high quality of the videos, textures, dynamics of scenes, camera movements, and a good level of consistency. 
OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman also posted some videos to X (formerly Twitter) generated in response to user-suggested prompts, to demonstrate Sora’s capabilities.

How does Sora work?
Sora combines features of text and image generating tools in what is called a “diffusion transformer model”. 
Transformers are a type of neural network first introduced by Google in 2017. They are best known for their use in large language models such as ChatGPT and Google Gemini.
Diffusion models, on the other hand, are the foundation of many AI image generators. They work by starting with random noise and iterating towards a “clean” image that fits an input prompt.



Diffusion models (in this case Stable Diffusion) generate images from noise over many iterations.

A video can be made from a sequence of such images. However, in a video, coherence and consistency between frames are essential. 
Sora uses the transformer architecture to handle how frames relate to one another. While transformers were initially designed to find patterns in tokens representing text, Sora instead uses tokens representing small patches of space and time.
Leading the pack
Sora is not the first text-to-video model. Earlier models include Emu by Meta, Gen-2 by Runway, Stable Video Diffusion by Stability AI, and recently Lumiere by Google. 
Lumiere, released just a few weeks ago, claimed to produce better video than its predecessors. But Sora appears to be more powerful than Lumiere in at least some respects.
Sora can generate videos with a resolution of up to 1920 × 1080 pixels, and in a variety of aspect ratios, while Lumiere is limited to 512 × 512 pixels. Lumiere’s videos are around 5 seconds long, while Sora makes videos up to 60 seconds. 
Lumiere cannot make videos composed of multiple shots, while Sora can. Sora, like other models, is also reportedly capable of video-editing tasks such as creating videos from images or other videos, combining elements from different videos, and extending videos in time.



Both models generate broadly realistic videos, but may suffer from hallucinations. Lumiere’s videos may be more easily recognised as AI-generated. Sora’s videos look more dynamic, having more interactions between elements. 
However, in many of the example videos inconsistencies become apparent on close inspection.
Promising applications
Video content is currently produced either by filming the real world or by using special effects, both of which can be costly and time consuming. If Sora becomes available at a reasonable price, people may start using it as a prototyping software to visualise ideas at a much lower cost. 
Based on what we know of Sora’s capabilities it could even be used to create short videos for some applications in entertainment, advertising and education.
OpenAI’s technical paper about Sora is titled “Video generation models as world simulators”. The paper argues that bigger versions of video generators like Sora may be “capable simulators of the physical and digital world, and the objects, animals and people that live within them”.

If this is correct, future versions may have scientific applications for physical, chemical, and even societal experiments. For example, one might be able to test the impact of tsunamis of different sizes on different kinds of infrastructure – and on the physical and mental health of the people nearby.
Achieving this level of simulation is highly challenging, and some experts say a system like Sora is fundamentally incapable of doing it.
A complete simulator would need to calculate physical and chemical reactions at the most detailed levels of the universe. However, simulating a rough approximation of the world and making realistic videos to human eyes might be within reach in the coming years.
Risks and ethical concerns
The main concerns around tools like Sora revolve around their societal and ethical impact. In a world already plagued by disinformation, tools like Sora may make things worse.
It’s easy to see how the ability to generate realistic video of any scene you can describe could be used to spread convincing fake news or throw doubt on real footage. It may endanger public health measures, be used to influence elections, or even burden the justice system with potential fake evidence.

Video generators may also enable direct threats to targeted individuals, via deepfakes – particularly pornographic ones. These may have terrible repercussions on the lives of the affected individuals and their families.
Beyond these concerns, there are also questions of copyright and intellectual property. Generative AI tools require vast amounts of data for training, and OpenAI has not revealed where Sora’s training data came from.
Large language models and image generators have also been criticised for this reason. In the United States, a group of famous authors have sued OpenAI over a potential misuse of their materials. The case argues that large language models and the companies who use them are stealing the authors’ work to create new content.

It is not the first time in recent memory that technology has run ahead of the law. For instance, the question of the obligations of social media platforms in moderating content has created heated debate in the past couple of years – much of it revolving around Section 230 of the US Code.
While these concerns are real, based on past experience we would not expect them to stop the development of video-generating technology. OpenAI says it is “taking several important safety steps” before making Sora available to the public, including working with experts in “misinformation, hateful content, and bias” and “building tools to help detect misleading content”.

Automation may be possible — but when will businesses want to do it?

Why It Matters		



Looking specifically at computer vision, the researchers found that technical and cost barriers could lead to gradual rather than rapid AI task automation.

The emergence of generative artificial intelligence has companies scrambling to define AI strategy and find use cases as workers fret that automation is coming for their jobs.

But while AI job displacement will likely be substantial in the long run, the roll out will be gradual. A new working paper, “Beyond AI Exposure: Which Tasks Are Cost-Effective to Automate With Computer Vision,” found that while AI will likely change labor patterns, predictions of rapid, widespread automation do not consider a slow adoption curve and the technical feasibility and economic attractiveness of building AI systems to do a specific job.
Researchers Neil Thompson, Maja S. Svanberg, and Wensu Li of MIT; Martin Fleming of The Productivity Institute; and Brian Goehring of IBM created a new AI task automation model to more accurately predict the pace of automation. Looking specifically at computer vision, they found that technical and cost barriers could leave about three-quarters of jobs unchanged in the near term.
“Our work highlights the importance of moving beyond ‘AI exposure,’ which looks at technologically what might be automated, to accounting for the economics of the adoption decision to know what is attractive to automate,” said Thompson, a research scientist at MIT Sloan and the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. “It is important to split apart the impact of AI on job automation from job augmentation, which is likely to have much different effects on the economy.”
A new model to predict AI automation 
While previous automation studies have measured the overall potential for AI to affect a particular area or job, the researchers created a model to look at when AI adoption is economically attractive, based on the following:
The level of performance required for an automated system to complete a particular task, based on surveys of workers familiar with the task.
The technical considerations of actually building an AI system capable of that performance.
The economic factors involved in building and deploying such a system.
The model looked specifically at computer vision applications, where cost modeling is more developed. The researchers found that at today’s costs, only 23% of worker wages associated with vision tasks would actually be attractive to automate. This means U.S. businesses would likely opt out of automating most vision tasks that lend themselves to AI.
To illustrate how the model works, the researchers used the example of a small bakery deciding whether to automate with computer vision. Bakers visually check ingredients for quality, a task that could be replaced by a computer vision system able to detect when food has gone bad.
Based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, bakers spend about 6% of their time checking food quality. That means a small bakery with five bakers making a typical salary of $48,000 each is looking at a potential labor savings of $14,000 a year to automate that one task. “This amount is far less than the cost of developing, deploying, and maintaining a computer vision system,” the researchers write. “We would conclude that it is not economical to substitute human labor with an AI system at this bakery.”
Many tasks are simply not attractive to automate because the AI systems required to do them would be far too costly to build to ensure a proper return on investment, Thompson said, and there typically aren’t enough workers doing a task to justify the cost of creating and deploying a system for automation.
The researchers also noted that most evaluations of AI’s impact mix together full task automation, which is more likely to displace workers, and partial automation, which will likely improve worker productivity.
Other key findings from the research
Expect an adoption curve. Large companies are more likely to be interested in and ultimately deploy AI systems than smaller companies with more limited resources. However, the slow rollout of AI could be accelerated if costs for systems decline or if applications are deployed using AI-as-a-service platforms, which deliver greater scale.
There are challenges with the AI-as-a-service approach, however. It will require industry collaboration and policy initiatives to promote data sharing across companies, and it will also demand major industry and organizational recalibration if tasks are parceled out and handed off to third-party providers.

AI automation probably won’t outpace existing job automation. Automation has already come for workers’ jobs, and it is unclear whether adding AI to the mix will substantially alter the number of jobs lost, the researchers found. A large part of AI task automation will be channeled to areas where traditional automation is already happening. “Hence the two types will substitute for each other, at least in part, and the net effect will be less than the sum of each,” the researchers write.
The researchers also found that after an initial spike, job loss from computer vision will likely be smaller than the existing job churn seen in the market.
Gradual adoption allows time for intervention. A slow adoption curve creates time to institute new policies or employee retraining programs that address the impact of automation on workers.
“Our results point to a notably different path for AI automation than previously explored in the literature — one where the pace is more in-line with traditional job churn and more amenable to traditional policy interventions, and where the cost-effectiveness of systems is crucial to determining their spread,” the researchers write.

Search algorithms are algorithms designed to search for or retrieve elements from a data structure, where they are stored. They are essential to access desired elements in a data structure and retrieve them when a need arises. A vital aspect of search algorithms is Path Finding, which is used to find paths that can be taken to traverse from one point to another, by finding the most optimum route.
In this tutorial titled ‘A* Algorithm - An Introduction To The powerful search algorithm’, you will be dealing with the A* algorithm, which is a search algorithm that finds the shortest path between two points.
Your AI/ML Career is Just Around The Corner!AI Engineer Master's ProgramExplore Program
What is an A* Algorithm?
It is a searching algorithm that is used to find the shortest path between an initial and a final point.
It is a handy algorithm that is often used for map traversal to find the shortest path to be taken. A* was initially designed as a graph traversal problem, to help build a robot that can find its own course. It still remains a widely popular algorithm for graph traversal.
It searches for shorter paths first, thus making it an optimal and complete algorithm. An optimal algorithm will find the least cost outcome for a problem, while a complete algorithm finds all the possible outcomes of a problem.
Another aspect that makes A* so powerful is the use of weighted graphs in its implementation. A weighted graph uses numbers to represent the cost of taking each path or course of action. This means that the algorithms can take the path with the least cost, and find the best route in terms of distance and time.

Figure 1: Weighted Graph
A major drawback of the algorithm is its space and time complexity. It takes a large amount of space to store all possible paths and a lot of time to find them.

Applications of A* Algorithm
The A* algorithm is widely used in various domains for pathfinding and optimization problems. It has applications in robotics, video games, route planning, logistics, and artificial intelligence. In robotics, A* helps robots navigate obstacles and find optimal paths. In video games, it enables NPCs to navigate game environments intelligently. Route planning applications use A* to find the shortest or fastest routes between locations. Logistics industries utilize A* for vehicle routing and scheduling. A* is also employed in AI systems, such as natural language processing and machine learning, to optimize decision-making processes. Its versatility and efficiency make it a valuable algorithm in many real-world scenarios.
Why A* Search Algorithm?
A* Search Algorithm is a simple and efficient search algorithm that can be used to find the optimal path between two nodes in a graph. It will be used for the shortest path finding. It is an extension of Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm (Dijkstra’s Algorithm). The extension here is that, instead of using a priority queue to store all the elements, we use heaps (binary trees) to store them. The A* Search Algorithm also uses a heuristic function that provides additional information regarding how far away from the goal node we are. This function is used in conjunction with the f-heap data structure in order to make searching more efficient.
Let us now look at a brief explanation of the A* algorithm.
Explanation
In the event that we have a grid with many obstacles and we want to get somewhere as rapidly as possible, the A* Search Algorithms are our savior. From a given starting cell, we can get to the target cell as quickly as possible. It is the sum of two variables’ values that determines the node it picks at any point in time. 
At each step, it picks the node with the smallest value of ‘f’ (the sum of ‘g’ and ‘h’) and processes that node/cell. ‘g’ and ‘h’ is defined as simply as possible below:

‘g’ is the distance it takes to get to a certain square on the grid from the starting point, following the path we generated to get there. 
‘h’ is the heuristic, which is the estimation of the distance it takes to get to the finish line from that square on the grid.

Heuristics are basically educated guesses. It is crucial to understand that we do not know the distance to the finish point until we find the route since there are so many things that might get in the way (e.g., walls, water, etc.). In the coming sections, we will dive deeper into how to calculate the heuristics.
Let us now look at the detailed algorithm of A*. 
Your AI/ML Career is Just Around The Corner!AI Engineer Master's ProgramExplore ProgramAlgorithm
Initial condition - we create two lists - Open List and Closed List.
Now, the following steps need to be implemented -

The open list must be initialized. 
Put the starting node on the open list (leave its f at zero). Initialize the closed list. 
Follow the steps until the open list is non-empty:


Find the node with the least f on the open list and name it “q”.
Remove Q from the open list.
Produce q's eight descendants and set q as their parent.
For every descendant:

i) If finding a successor is the goal, cease looking
ii)Else, calculate g and h for the successor.
successor.g = q.g + the calculated distance between the successor and the q.
successor.h = the calculated distance between the successor and the goal. We will cover three heuristics to do this: the Diagonal, the Euclidean, and the Manhattan heuristics.
successor.f = successor.g plus successor.h
iii) Skip this successor if a node in the OPEN list with the same location as it but a lower f value than the successor is present.
iv) Skip the successor if there is a node in the CLOSED list with the same position as the successor but a lower f value; otherwise, add the node to the open list end (for loop).

Push Q into the closed list and end the while loop.

We will now discuss how to calculate the Heuristics for the nodes.
Master Tools You Need For Becoming an AI EngineerAI Engineer Master's ProgramExplore ProgramHeuristics
We can easily calculate g, but how do we actually calculate h? 
There are two methods that we can use to calculate the value of h:
1. Determine h's exact value (which is certainly time-consuming).
(or)
2. Utilize various techniques to approximate the value of h. (less time-consuming).
Let us discuss both methods.
Exact Heuristics
Although we can obtain exact values of h, doing so usually takes a very long time.
The ways to determine h's precise value are listed below.
1. Before using the A* Search Algorithm, pre-calculate the distance between every pair of cells.
2. Using the distance formula/Euclidean Distance, we may directly determine the precise value of h in the absence of blocked cells or obstructions.
Let us look at how to calculate Approximation Heuristics.
Master Gen AI Strategies for Businesses withGenerative AI for Business Transformation ProgramExplore ProgramApproximation Heuristics
To determine h, there are typically three approximation heuristics:
1. Manhattan Distance
The Manhattan Distance is the total of the absolute values of the discrepancies between the x and y coordinates of the current and the goal cells. 
The formula is summarized below -
h = abs (curr_cell.x – goal.x) + 
     abs (curr_cell.y – goal.y)
We must use this heuristic method when we are only permitted to move in four directions - top, left, right, and bottom.
Let us now take a look at the Diagonal Distance method to calculate the heuristic.
2. Diagonal Distance
It is nothing more than the greatest absolute value of differences between the x and y coordinates of the current cell and the goal cell. 
This is summarized below in the following formula -
dx = abs(curr_cell.x – goal.x)
dy = abs(curr_cell.y – goal.y)
h = D * (dx + dy) + (D2 - 2 * D) * min(dx, dy)
where D is the length of every node (default = 1) and D2 is the diagonal
We use this heuristic method when we are permitted to move only in eight directions, like the King’s moves in Chess.
Let us now take a look at the Euclidean Distance method to calculate the heuristic.
3. Euclidean Distance
The Euclidean Distance is the distance between the goal cell and the current cell using the distance formula:
 h = sqrt ( (curr_cell.x – goal.x)^2 + 
            (curr_cell.y – goal.y)^2 )
We use this heuristic method when we are permitted to move in any direction of our choice.
Want To Become an AI Engineer? Look No Further!AI Engineer Master's ProgramExplore ProgramThe Basic Concept of A* Algorithm
A heuristic algorithm sacrifices optimality, with precision and accuracy for speed, to solve problems faster and more efficiently.
All graphs have different nodes or points which the algorithm has to take, to reach the final node. The paths between these nodes all have a numerical value, which is considered as the weight of the path. The total of all paths transverse gives you the cost of that route.
Initially, the Algorithm calculates the cost to all its immediate neighboring nodes,n, and chooses the one incurring the least cost. This process repeats until no new nodes can be chosen and all paths have been traversed. Then, you should consider the best path among them. If f(n) represents the final cost, then it can be denoted as :
f(n) = g(n) + h(n), where :
g(n) = cost of traversing from one node to another. This will vary from node to node
h(n) = heuristic approximation of the node's value. This is not a real value but an approximation cost

Figure 2: Weighted Graph 2
Consider the weighted graph depicted above, which contains nodes and the distance between them. Let's say you start from A and have to go to D.
Now, since the start is at the source A, which will have some initial heuristic value. Hence, the results are
f(A) = g(A) + h(A)f(A) = 0 + 6 = 6
Next, take the path to other neighbouring vertices :
f(A-B) = 1 + 4
f(A-C) = 5 + 2
Now take the path to the destination from these nodes, and calculate the weights :
f(A-B-D) = (1+ 7) + 0
f(A-C-D) = (5 + 10) + 0
It is clear that node B gives you the best path, so that is the node you need to take to reach the destination.
Pseudocode of A* Algorithm
The text below represents the pseudocode of the Algorithm. It can be used to implement the algorithm in any programming language and is the basic logic behind the Algorithm.

Make an open list containing starting node

If it reaches the destination node :



Make a closed empty list 
If it does not reach the destination node, then consider a node with the lowest f-score in the open list


We are finished

Else :

Put the current node in the list and check its neighbors

For each neighbor of the current node :

If the neighbor has a lower g value than the current node and is in the closed list:


Replace neighbor with this new node as the neighbor’s parent

Else If (current g is lower and neighbor is in the open list):

Replace neighbor with the lower g value and change the neighbor’s parent to the current node.

Else If the neighbor is not in both lists:

Add it to the open list and set its g
How to Implement the A* Algorithm in Python?
Consider the graph shown below. The nodes are represented in pink circles, and the weights of the paths along the nodes are given. The numbers above the nodes represent the heuristic value of the nodes.

Figure 3: Weighted graph for A* Algorithm
You start by creating a class for the algorithm. Now, describe the open and closed lists. Here, you are using sets and two dictionaries - one to store the distance from the starting node, and another for parent nodes. And initialize them to 0, and the start node.

Figure 4: Initializing important parameters
Now, find the neighboring node with the lowest f(n) value. You must also code for the condition of reaching the destination node. If this is not the case, put the current node in the open list if it's not already on it, and set its parent nodes.

Figure 5: Adding nodes to open list and setting parents of nodes
If the neighbor has a lower g value than the current node and is in the closed list, replace it with this new node as the neighbor's parent.

Figure 6: Checking distances and updating the g values
If the current g is lower than the previous g, and its neighbor is in the open list, replace it with the lower g value and change the neighbor's parent to the current node.
If the neighbor is not in both lists, add it to the open list and set its g value.

Figure 7: Checking distances, updating the g values, and adding parents
Now, define a function to return neighbors and their distances.

                                              Figure 8: Defining neighbors
Also, create a function to check the heuristic values.

Figure 9: Defining a function to return heuristic values
Let’s describe our graph and call the A star function.

Figure 10: Calling A* function
The algorithm traverses through the graph and finds the path with the least cost
 which is through E => D => G.
Advantages of A* Algorithm
The A* algorithm offers several advantages.

Firstly, it guarantees finding the optimal path when used with appropriate heuristics.
Secondly, it is efficient and can handle large search spaces by effectively pruning unpromising paths.
Thirdly, it can be easily tailored to accommodate different problem domains and heuristics.
Fourthly, A* is flexible and adaptable to varying terrain costs or constraints. Additionally, it is widely implemented and has a vast amount of resources and support available.

Overall, the advantages of A* make it a popular choice for solving pathfinding and optimization problems.
Disadvantages of A* Algorithm
While the A* algorithm has numerous advantages, it also has some limitations.

One disadvantage is that A* can be computationally expensive in certain scenarios, especially when the search space is extensive and the number of possible paths is large.
The algorithm may consume significant memory and processing resources.
Another limitation is that A* heavily relies on the quality of the heuristic function. If the heuristic is poorly designed or does not accurately estimate the distance to the goal, the algorithm's performance and optimality may be compromised.
Additionally, A* may struggle with certain types of graphs or search spaces that exhibit irregular or unpredictable structures.

What if the search space in A* Algorithm is not a grid and is a graph?
The A* algorithm can be applied to non-grid search spaces that are represented as graphs. In this case, the nodes in the graph represent states or locations, and the edges represent the connections or transitions between them. The key difference lies in the definition of neighbors for each node, which is determined by the edges in the graph rather than the adjacent cells in a grid. A* can still be used to find the optimal path in such graph-based search spaces by appropriately defining the heuristic function and implementing the necessary data structures and algorithms to traverse the graph.
Examples of A* Algorithm
A* has been successfully applied in numerous real-world scenarios. For instance, in robotic path planning, A* helps robots navigate through dynamic environments while avoiding obstacles. In game development, A* is used to create intelligent enemy AI that can chase and follow the player efficiently. In logistics and transportation, A* assists in finding the optimal routes for delivery vehicles, minimizing time and cost. Additionally, A* has applications in network routing, such as finding the shortest path in a computer network. These examples highlight the versatility and practicality of A* algorithm concepts and implementations in various domains.

The generative AI revolution has the power to transform how banks operate. Banks are increasingly turning to AI to assist with a wide range of tasks, from customer onboarding to fraud detection and risk regulation.
For generative AI to be truly effective it must have access to the right data, but banks are almost unique in their complexity when it comes to how their data is siloed on legacy systems. So, as they leap into AI, banks must first ensure that their data is AI-ready.  This is a significant step and vital to success.
 Copilot: welcome to your virtual team
Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 helps banks get the most from generative AI. Copilot combines large language models (LLMs) with the bank’s data, providing staff access to a virtual PA, copywriter and analyst.
Copilot is integrated into Microsoft 365 and automatically inherits the company’s security, compliance, and privacy policies and processes. It allows employees to interact with familiar work tools, from Microsoft Word to PowerPoint, using everyday language prompts or inputs.
Banks reported that harnessing Copilot for meeting summaries, email drafting and content generation was saving between half an hour and two hours a week per employee. Copilot can also help with security issues, setting up an early warning system to detect malware, trojans or phishing, as well as identify potential anti-money laundering issues and provide auto-healing for security loopholes.
 More human(s), not less
The job of Copilot is not to replace human banking activity but to make bank staff more human. Not just to increase productivity, efficiency and innovation but to free up staff to create deeper customer relationships. According to Avanade research, almost two-thirds of banks (62%) will need more people to help with AI in 2024 not less. Over half (53%) think they will need significant support to train staff in the use of generative AI tools, such as Copilot.
Avanade can help banking teams to work out how to get the most value from generative AI. Being a key Microsoft partner means we have access to the latest tools from the Microsoft portfolio,  including the latest OpenAI technologies.
Avanade can partner with banks to assess the readiness of employees and ecosystem partners.  We can prioritise actions that enable banks to use AI at scale, including governance and new operating models.

[+] hundreds, of iterations and scenarios to choose from.getty
Cities, the pulsating hubs of human civilization, face poly-crises: growing population pressures, emissions, waste, traffic and noise, aging obsolete infrastructure, chronic housing affordability, employment and the ever-present need for climate resiliency (more than 40% of the world’s urban population lives on the coasts) .


Most of the urban policies, tools, planning and engineering ideas of the mid-20th century that scaled globally have failed and sent virtually every city on an unsustainable and vulnerable path. More than half the world’s population now live in cities, and that number jumps to 80% in the next 25 years necessitating billions of tons of new material and expanded urban footprints. The needed changes to avert accelerating the crisis is immense and urgent. Cities are not buildings, streets or energy systems, cities are about people, culture, behavior, power and politics- the very word comes from Ancient Greek πολιτικά (politiká) 'affairs of the cities. We can’t keep using the same tools expecting different results- something has to to give.

In comes generative urban AI, an emerging and transformative technology poised to radically change urban planning, design, and city management. Imagine generating optimized city layouts, built form, energy, water, transport, waste and community systems. Imagine integrated systems offering personalized public services in one stop shop fashion – the possibilities are truly mind-boggling because they are data driven and they’re being developed in adjacent industries as we speak.

From AI dreams to real-time urban design and decision making

Just like the latest text to video tools like Open AI’s Sora, you can now describe and generate your ideal urban environment - walkable streets, green spaces, and a vibrant mix of shops and homes. New urban generative AI platforms can move from vision into reality in seconds with dozens, if not hundreds, of iterations and scenarios to review and choose from. Specifically generative AI allows a major shift in how cities plan, decide and design:


From reactive to proactive: Shift from fixing problems to predicting and preventing them.
Data-driven insights: Uncover hidden patterns and trends for smarter decision-making,
Personalized experiences: Tailor offerings to individual city stakeholder needs and preferences simultaneously.
Augmenting city staff expertise: AI empowers staff capabilities for more rapid piloting, knowledge transfer and accuracy.

Proactive Data-Driven Decisions 
Cities are treasure troves of data, reflecting development and travel patterns, energy consumption, and citizen needs. However, they are usually siloed, not connected and in different formats. The saying “without data there is no AI” holds very true for cities. Generative AI can only optimize and analyze data that is in a usable format. In my work, I’ve personally seen what AI is capable of and the ability to optimize the urban fabric, the movement of people and goods, predict congestion hotspots, and suggest infrastructure improvements is just the beginning. Several companies are offering urban AI-powered solutions for predicting the probability of weather related impacts on city infrastructure, severity of vehicle collisions, infrastructure maintenance optimization, and localized urban planning simulations. This data-driven approach allows for proactive planning, permitting and mitigating issues before they arise by creating more responsive, transparent and inclusive urban governance.

Empowering Citizens Democratizing City Processes
Traditionally, urban planning has been a top-down affair. Generative AI is changing that, democratizing the often labyrinthian bureaucracy by opening doors for citizen engagement, transparency and participation from the ground up. From deciphering complex zoning and building codes, to finding often contradictory engineering rules and planning regulations, residents can leverage AI-powered tools including conversational chatbots to answer their questions on their schedules, while city staff gather feedback on proposed plans, increasing transparency and inclusivity. Several companies are utilizing immersive VR and AI to visualize future virtual urban environments allowing citizens to understand and contribute to the planning process in a meaningful way.Generative AI democratizes the urban planning process for community groupsgetty
Global Cities Leading the Urban AI Transition
Most cities are at the beginning of their generative AI journey and in my work I;ve ben speaking with several sharing the best practices from adjacent and relevant industries. Several cities are starting to test and pilot AI concepts. They have been utilizing various forms of AI from computer vision to machine learning and some have started applications using generative AI. Here are just a few city AI examples by region:


Americas: Los Angeles, Seattle and Boston trialing AI in public transport, public spaces and traffic management, Pittsburgh prioritizing green development, Toronto and Curitiba managing traffic flow with AI systems, Buenos Aires streamlines waste collection with AI prediction, and Santiago pilots AI for noise control and urban simulations.
Europe And Middle East: Copenhagen and Amsterdam leverages AI to optimize building and district energy use, Helsinki spearheads the future of mobility with AI-powered solutions, Oslo embraces AI to predict and optimize waste collection routes, and Barcelona, Dubai and Tel-Aviv are utilizing AI for their transport and sustainable energy management.
Africa: Cape Town tackles traffic and crime with AI-powered management and surveillance, Lagos pilots AI tools for smarter land use and infrastructure development and in Kigali, AI-powered drones deliver and drive smart city and medical initiatives, aiming to streamline efficiency and leapfrog 20th century legacy infrastructure.
Asia Pacific: Singapore has a comprehensive AI policy for all their services, training and investments, Tokyo tackles traffic, disasters, and personalized public transport with AI, while Beijing utilizes it for air quality, building energy optimization, and smart city infrastructure. Seoul, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane utilizing AI for traffic management, public safety, demand prediction and route optimization.

Singapore is a leader in AI applications as part of their Smart Nation policy.getty
Challenges and Considerations
In my work I’m witnessing a wave of generative AI adoption in every industry and vertical that I’m currently working with and urban planning is no exception. I’ve been conducting workshops and initiating conversations on this topic with business, city leaders and AI startups to help them understand the enormous opportunities and to be aware of the potential pitfalls and lessons learned from other sectors. While the potential of generative AI is immense, challenges remain. Data bias can lead to discriminatory outputs, highlighting the need for responsible development and ethical considerations. Human oversight and transparency in model development are crucial. Additionally, the social and economic implications of urban AI adoption need careful consideration as it can exacerbate inequities if left unchecked.
Generative urban AI is here, are urban planners ready?
The tide is turning, and generative urban AI is surging. While its potential to optimize urban form, streets, energy, emissions, waste, communications and public services is undeniable, are urban planners, engineers and administrators prepared to navigate this revolutionary wave? From my recent experience and conversations in this space the skillsets are in need of an upgrade: from story telling, data governance, urban analysis, coding fluency, and an ethical framework for AI. Universities are just beginning to teach the next generation of city planners and communities need engagement and training with these tools to build trust.
It has to be better than what they have today which is a fragmented mosaic of siloed data sets, policy, bureaucracy and departments at various local, state and federal levels that at times work at cross purposes. And then there is the politics. But it is not insurmountable. In my experience planners and engineers are brilliant problem solvers, just get the politics out of the way (or at least hold it back) and watch them deliver amazing projects, polices and programs. I’ve seen that first hand and when it happens it’s incredible.Preparing for generative urban AI requires a multi-pronged approach.getty
Preparing for generative urban AI demands a three-pronged approach: upskilling the workforce with AI company partnerships, genuine community engagement, and establishing ethical AI and data governance frameworks. So what it is the starting point? Build awareness among the staff. Focus on the problem to solve. Explore key city problems that relevant AI enabled projects could help with, engage with the private sector for their partnership and proceed with care. Develop robust AI policy frameworks making it clear what staff can and cannot use AI for, how communities will have their privacy protected, link to you cyber security framework, and how you will tackle ethics, bias and fairness.
By embracing these challenges and navigating them responsibly, planners can unlock AI's potential to build inclusive, resilient, and truly smart cities for the future. Let's co-create a future where responsible generative AI shapes a better urban landscape for all. Billions of people are counting on us to get it right. We owe them that.

The Office of Personnel Management last week announced the latest step in a years-long effort to prepare federal agencies for artificial intelligence: surveying federal workers already dealing with AI.The 2020 AI in Government Act requires OPM to identify the key skills and competencies required of a federal employee working with AI, including the creation of new or revision of existing job series associated with artificial intelligence. And President Biden’s 2023 executive order on AI requires federal agencies, including OPM, to ensure that AI is used safely and securely, as well as conduct a “national AI talent surge” to recruit feds who specialize in the new technology.Last July, OPM completed the first step of its work, identifying 43 general and 14 technical competencies required for work with AI. And in a memo last week, Veronica Hinton, OPM’s associate director for workforce policy and innovation, announced the HR agency’s next task: surveying current federal employees who are already working with AI to confirm OPM’s initial list of skills.“The OPM artificial intelligence job analysis survey represents the next phase of the study and will be used to validate the AI competencies identified by technical and human resources subject matter experts as needed for performing AI work governmentwide,” Hinton wrote. “OPM plans to issue the OPM AI Job Analysis Survey today, the results of which will be used to develop an AI competency model.”Targeted for the survey are federal employees doing AI work at the Office of Science and Technology Policy, chief information and chief data officers, along with other technical and subject matter experts across government. Feds who work with AI but who have not been contacted via email to complete the survey may email competency@opm.gov to be added to the list.Later in the process, OPM may revise occupational series—or create new ones—to incorporate AI-related skills, as well as determine both how many federal employees are working in positions related to AI at each agency, and conduct two- and five-year forecasts of how many feds in AI jobs each agency will need to hire or otherwise employ.“Agencies will have the ability to identify AI talent with the needed skillsets to meet their missions and strategic goals,” Hinton wrote. “The newly validated AI competency model will serve as the foundation for assessing, hiring, developing and promoting talent into newly emerging work roles as well as enhancing the federal workforce skillsets. OPM’s AI competency model will also inform the creation of an AI competency framework through our partnership with the National Science Foundation.”

A “bold and thoughtful” adoption of generative artificial intelligence (genAI) could significantly boost productivity and improve the quality of life of all Australians, a new report has found.
McKinsey’s Generative AI and the future of work in Australia report found that the technology has the potential to increase Australian labour productivity by up to 1.1 percentage points per year through to 2030 and automate as much as half of all workplace activities within the decade.
It found that the proper implementation of technologies such as ChatGPT could help to reverse Australia’s lagging productivity.
“If Australia were to achieve even half of the potential productivity uplift, it could be on track to rekindle the faster economic growth of the post-1990s heyday,” the McKinsey report said.
“Generative AI unlocks a future that may differ markedly from the present.
“Supporting an optimistic outlook, Australia’s economy has proved robust through challenging times, and shifts from genAI could unlock benefits for Australia – including higher job demand and productivity.”
“However, this potential may only be realised if employers, governments, and educators are able to adopt the technology in a bold and thoughtful way.
“Such strategic action could ensure that future generations of Australians benefit from the same prosperity that the country has experienced over the past three decades.”
The report found that 62 per cent of existing workforce tasks have the potential to be automated using today’s genAI technology, up from 44 per cent in a McKinsey report from 2019.
This, along without economic changes, could see about 1.3 million people, or just under 10 per cent of the Australian workforce, needing to transition into new jobs by 2030.
The report separated industries in Australia into three categories based on how they will respond to the growth in generative AI: resilient and growing, stalled but rising, and disrupted and declining.
Resilience and growth
According to the report, science and technology jobs are resilient and growing, and can expect to see a net demand of 1.5 million additional jobs from 2022 to 2030.
Modelling in the report found that if genAI is adopted early and quickly, just over 50 per cent of workplace activities could be automated by 2030.
But the late adoption scenario looked in the report would see this figure being just 2 per cent.
“Advances in genAI have accelerated Australia’s automation opportunity,” the report said.
“If implemented well, these technologies could improve Australia’s productivity – and the quality of life of its people.”
GenAI tools are a “significant new force with the potential to reshape the future of work” and “could become ubiquitous, embedded into knowledge workers’ everyday tools”.
These knowledge workers will likely experience the biggest impact from generative AI too, the report found, with the demand for social, emotional, and technological skills set to increase rapidly.
Australians currently spend more than 40 per cent of their work hours on decision-making and collaboration, applying expertise, managing people, and interacting with stakeholders.
To adapt to the changes to be brought about by these technologies, Australian workers will need to be constantly building their skills.
The report backs up the findings of a recent Productivity Commission study that warned the government against “overzealous lawmaking”, and called for it to lead by example with a “stepped, gradual approach” to regulating AI.
The Productivity Commission found that AI has the potential to help to resolve Australia’s productivity slump.
A study last year found Australian companies are more likely than their international peers to ban ChatGPT, but also said that its use could improve efficiency and enhance creativity.

Kelcey Gibbons, a doctoral student who studies African Americans in technology and the Black middle class, is not quite sure what she makes of generative artificial intelligence and how it might impact the racial wealth gap. 
Gibbons anticipates that generative AI will force organizations to rethink which skills matter in the workplace, aggravating existing inequalities without a strong emphasis on access and education. 
It could also become a scapegoat for why disadvantaged groups struggle with upward mobility. Whether it narrows the racial wealth gap will depend on participation from the bottom up, Gibbons said.
Generative AI is a broad term for artificial intelligence that can create new content, such as art, audio, code, music, text and videos. It uses machine learning, another form of artificial intelligence that gleans patterns from data and algorithms that help to process new and more information.
The technology can increase productivity by automating tasks now done by humans. For example, chatGPT is a tool trained to produce text and code. It can provide detailed responses to questions, translate languages, identify errors in code and provide copywriting in the voice of a brand.  
Other generative AI tools and platforms can create interactive virtual learning or gaming environments. Professional sports leagues like the NBA and NHL are using generative AI to provide more detailed sports content to their consumers and better understand their audiences.
Workers fear generative AI will replace human jobs, which will affect Black people, who have the highest unemployment rates in the nation. 
In other words, generative AI is just the latest version of the old saying: “When America catches a cold, Black people get pneumonia.” In this case, it’s because Black people are disproportionately in the jobs that technology is likely to replace. And it could mean, once again, that fewer Black people will have decent jobs. 
According to a recent report by the McKinsey Institute for Black Economic Mobility, part of the business management and consulting firm McKinsey & Co., generative AI has the potential to widen the racial wealth gap between Black and white Americans by $43 billion annually over the next 20 years. 
But if generative AI is applied with equity in mind, it could instead help close the racial wealth gap and remove barriers to Black economic mobility, the report says. 
Not so fast, said Amy Slaton, a professor of history at Drexel University in Philadelphia. Despite discourse around inclusion and a “tremendous faith in the idea of merit,” the systems in which people of color and marginalized groups operate seldom change.  
“Generative AI comes in with a high-tech promise for the economy, but it’s not,” Slaton said. “Nothing is changing for the communities that make up that economy.”
Big technological shifts have a history of keeping Black people at or near the bottom already.
During the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, global trade networks yielded tremendous profits from buying and selling human beings. As global trade, including cotton and sugar production, grew, so did regimes of enslavement.
Slavery ended. Agriculture became more mechanized. New industrial opportunities popped up in cities amid a massive scale-up in manufacturing and consumption.
Black people exercised agency in their lives by migrating from the rural South to economic opportunities in urban areas in the North. But as companies developed assembly lines, new managerial techniques and later automation, reducing jobs, they did so in service to white capitalists, Slaton said.

“Capitalism in America is racial capitalism,” Slaton said.
To be sure, the Civil Rights era and integration ushered in sweeping changes for disadvantaged groups. “Individuals’ lives are drastically changed,” Slaton said. “But it’s a hierarchical economy, and people of color are historically at the bottom. AI will exacerbate that.” 
According to the McKinsey report, Black workers are overrepresented in four of the top five occupations most at risk of automation. They include office support, production work, food services and mechanical installation and repair. Roughly three in four Black workers lack a college degree. 
But in the past five years, one in every eight Black workers without a four-year degree has moved to a job that rewards experience, offers annual salaries above $42,000 and provides a path of upward mobility. These jobs include training and development specialists, and sales managers. 
The problem is that these paths are likely to disappear, too. Between 2030 and 2060, the report says, generative AI is expected to replace about half these jobs that don’t require college degrees. 
To avoid being displaced, the report argues that workers should gain skills that machines cannot do. Those “future-proof skills” include “socioemotional understanding” and “comfort with ambiguity.” Occupational health and safety specialists and special education teachers are two examples of occupations that use those skills.
In the tech industry, workers should not merely know how to use a “specific coding language to code formulaically,” but should instead understand “computational and statistical principles in order to troubleshoot and solve problems with machine-generated code,” the report says.
“Capitalism in America is racial capitalism.”Amy Slaton, a professor of history at Drexel University in Philadelphia
That’s true for any technological development, said James Pristas, professor in the department of computing and information technology at the College of Southern Nevada in North Las Vegas. Pristas teaches an introduction to artificial intelligence course at the school, a public community college where more than half the student body is Latino, Asian or Black. 
It’s too soon to know how generative AI will shape the workforce, he said. The immediate impact, though, is how students are using it to complete their assignments, which makes it difficult for professors like him to assess them. 
“It’s a major step change that is going to change the way we teach and the way kids learn,” Pristas said.
So can generative AI be deployed in a way that narrows the racial wealth gap? 
“I think that’s a question of power and access,” said Gibbons, a PhD student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “Who gets to say what generative AI is, and for whom?”
Generative AI tools are already used to evaluate job candidates through keyword requirements, multiple choice exams and even voice or video analysis. They risk engaging in employment discrimination by excluding people based on race, religion, gender identity and other protected classes, according to the ACLU.
Last fall, President Biden signed an executive order on developing AI safely and responsibly. And in January, the administration said that major AI companies must now report their safety tests to the government. “My Administration cannot — and will not — tolerate the use of AI to disadvantage those who are already too often denied equal opportunity and justice,” Biden’s executive order says.  
Congress has yet to enact legislation on generative AI. Meanwhile, state and local governments are writing their own rules.
According to McKinsey, generative AI can be used with an equity lens by establishing regulatory guardrails, training it on unbiased and “authentically representative” datasets, growing “diverse tech talent,” engaging all stakeholders in the design of new products and encouraging leaders to use the technology only where it can make unbiased decisions. 
The goal is to “have all people and communities — including Black communities, previously left behind by seismic shifts in tech — benefit from this amazing technology transformation,” the report says in closing. 
“The time to act is now, using the foresight of past transformations as a guide.”

Specifically, the Guidelines encourage City employees, contractors, consultants, volunteers, and vendors to use generative AI tools for purposes such as preparing initial drafts of documents, “translating” text into levels of formality or for a particular audience, coding tasks, generating diagrams or images, and developing service interfaces such as chatbots.  The Guidelines also warn these individuals about common pitfalls when using generative AI, including “making an inappropriate decision that affects residents based on AI-generated content,” “producing information, either to the public or internally, that is inaccurate,” “incorporating biases found in the AI’s training data, resulting in inequities,” “cybersecurity problems or other errors,” “exposing non-public data as part of training data sets,” and “inaccurately attributing AI-generated content to official SF sources.” 
City employees, contractors, volunteers and vendors are cautioned by the Guidelines not to enter any information that cannot be fully released to the public, publish content created by generative AI without human review and disclosure, conceal the use of generative AI during interactions with colleagues or the public, or generate images, audio, or video that could be mistaken for real people (such as “deepfakes”), even with disclosure.
The Guidelines place responsibility on information technology (IT) leaders in connection with the use of generative AI by City employees. Among other things, departmental IT leaders have “a responsibility to support right-sized generative AI uses that deliver the greatest public benefit,” and should work with vendors to ensure that AI built into procured tools is explainable and auditable; experiment with training internal models on internal data; and, when considering implementing public-facing chatbots, thoroughly test and develop a language access plan.
The Guidelines follow President Joseph Biden’s Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence, issued in October 2023, California Governor Gavin Newsom’s Executive Order N-12-23, issued in September 2023, and the California Legislature’s Senate Concurrent Resolution 17, affirming the state’s commitment to The White House’s Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights.
Although limited in scope, private-sector employers who seek to be proactive in establishing AI guidelines or policies around employee use of generative AI should look to the Guidelines as one of many points of reference.  Given the rapid and fluid nature of this space, private-sector employers should also consult with counsel to make sure that they are implementing all workplace AI tools, including generative AI, in a legally compliant manner.",,,,"Epstein Becker &amp; Green, P.C.",,,,,,"['https://www.linkedin.com/company/epstein-becker-&amp;-green-p-c-', 'https://twitter.com/ebglaw', 'https://www.facebook.com/pages/Epstein-Becker-Green/140779175933414', 'https://www.instagram.com/ebglaw', 'https://www.youtube.com/user/ebglaw']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Krithivasan, in a conversation with CNBC-TV18 Managing Editor Shereen Bhan, discussed generative AI's potential impact on business and jobs, expressing cautious optimism. He addressed the perceived decoupling in the IT industry hiring, highlighting TCS's adaptive approach. By Vijay Anand   February 20, 2024, 8:37:54 PM IST (Updated)4 Min ReadTata Consultancy Services (TCS) Chief Executive Officer K. Krithivasan on Tuesday, February 20, shared his thoughts on the intricacies of generative AI, TCS's hiring strategy, and the nuanced impact of AI on business and jobs.
In an exclusive conversation with CNBC-TV18 Managing Editor Shereen Bhan on the sidelines of the 32nd Nasscom Technology & Leadership Forum, Krithivasan acknowledged the transformative potential of artificial intelligence — especially generative AI — but said it is too early to say how much of an impact it would have in the years to come.
Recently, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, in an exclusive interview, said AI could cause some displacement in the job market. 
Krithivasan started the conversation by acknowledging the surge in interest surrounding generative AI and recognising its potential while remaining cautious about potential disruptions in the short-to-medium term. ""Everyone wants to leverage generative AI, so there's so much work that needs to get done. So we believe there is a lot of opportunity there. But there could be medium-to-short-term disruptions because of the overall economic outlook. So we remain optimistic, at least cautiously optimistic, in the medium to long term,"" he said.

The discussion shifted to a perceived decoupling between revenue growth and hiring in the IT industry. Krithivasan countered this narrative, providing a nuanced perspective. ""Decoupling is too strong a word. Many organisations hired over the quota during the pandemic. As the demand stabilised and softened, we started using our existing workforce and training them, so we've been using the bench to fulfil the new requirements. So to call it decoupling is too early and to say that it is because of generative AI is not accurate,"" he explained.
On the potential impact of AI on the workforce, Krithivasan aligned with Nadella's view, emphasising the coexistence of displacement and opportunity. ""We agree with him. With every technology, there will be some displacement, and some disruption, but eventually, we'll be able to do more work. When you have to do more work; you need more people to do that,"" he stated.
On hiring trends, Krithivasan detailed the company's stance. ""We don't see any significant decline in hiring. But we probably may need to change the way we train people. The kind of people we hire may also change. But we don't expect to reduce hiring or for our headcount to decrease.""
Diving into the specifics of AI's role in the workforce, Krithivasan highlighted the need for a nuanced approach to training and skill development. ""So what generative AI is doing is increasing productivity in the middle where the programming takes place. But where you are trying to gather the requirements, validate the requirements, the design, or the planning process all towards the end, where you need to validate the output of the machine and create a superior user experience, you still need humans. Those areas will not go away very quickly. What probably may get replaced, or disrupted or where you get more productivity, is the middle,"" he said.

He added that critical thinking, strategic planning and creativity will always be in demand and that TCS will reorient its training to reflect that. ""These (human-centric skills) will not go away; you probably are going to need them in higher numbers.""
The conversation extended to the broader adoption of AI across companies, with Krithivasan outlining a phased approach. ""The way we look at generative AI or any of these AI technologies is in two three phases"" he explained.
He called these phases to assist, augment, and transform.
""Assist is just helping a human do the job better. Automate is participating in the work that a human is doing. So the first, assist, could be in a call centre where a question comes on what is in this document. The answer is the summary of the document. Augment means, say, like helping a wealth advisor suggest better products,"" he added.
""So in the initial stages, you will see more assist and augment. For you to see more programmes or work that gets in the transform space, it will take more time,"" he elaborated, providing a roadmap for the evolution of AI applications in the industry.
