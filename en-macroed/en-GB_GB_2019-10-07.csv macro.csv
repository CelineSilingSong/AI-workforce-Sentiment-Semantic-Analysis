      Algorithms can reinforce existing biases in society.

Artificial intelligence and facial analysis software is becoming commonplace in job interviews. The technology, developed by US company HireVue, analyses the language and tone of a candidate’s voice and records their facial expressions as they are videoed answering identical questions.
It was used in the UK for the first time in September but has been used around the world for several years. Some 700 companies, including Vodafone, Hilton and Urban Outfitters have tried it out. 
Certainly there are significant benefits to be had from this. HireVue says it speeds up the hiring process by 90% thanks to the speed of information processing. But there are important risks we should be wary of when outsourcing job interviews to AI.
The AI is built on algorithms that assess applicants against its database of about 25,000 pieces of facial and linguistic information. These are compiled from previous interviews of “successful hires” – those who have gone on to be good at the job. The 350 linguistic elements include criteria like a candidate’s tone of voice, their use of passive or active words, sentence length and the speed they talk. The thousands of facial features analysed include brow furrowing, brow raising, the amount eyes widen or close, lip tightening, chin raising and smiling.
The fundamental issue with this, as is often pointed out by critics of AI, is that this technology is not born in a perfect society. It is created within our existing society, marked by a whole range of different kinds of biases, prejudices, inequalities and discrimination. The data on which algorithms “learn” to judge candidates contains these existing sets of beliefs. 
As UCLA professor, Safya Noble, demonstrates in her book Algorithms of Oppression, a few simple Google searches shows this happening. For example, when you search the term “professor style”, Google Images returns exclusively middle-aged white men. You get similar results for a “successful manager” search. By contrast, a search for “housekeeping” returns pictures of women.

      Artificial intelligence could reinforce society's gender equality problems




This reflects how algorithms have “learnt” that professors and managers are mostly white men, while those who do housekeeping are women. And by delivering these results algorithms necessarily contribute to the consolidation, perpetuation and potentially even amplification of existing beliefs and biases. For this very reason we should question the intelligence of AI. The solutions it provides are necessarily conservative, leaving little room for innovation and social progress.

‘Symbolic capital’
As French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu emphasised in his work on the way that inequalities are reproduced, we all have very different economic and cultural capital. The environment in which we grow up, the quality of the teaching we had, the presence or absence of extra-curricular activities and a range of other factors, have a decisive impact on our intellectual abilities and strengths. This also has a big impact on the way we perceive ourselves – our levels of self-confidence, the objectives we set for ourselves, and our chances in life. 
Another famous sociologist, Erving Goffman, called it a “sense of one’s place”. It is this ingrained sense of how we should act that leads people with less cultural capital (generally from less privileged backgrounds) to keep to their “ordinary” place. This is also reflected in our body language and the way we speak. So there are those who, from an early age, have a stronger confidence in their abilities and knowledge. And there are many others who have not been exposed to the same teachings and cultural practices, and may be more timid and reserved. They may even suffer from an inferiority complex.
All of this will come across in job interviews. Ease, confidence, self-assurance and linguistic skills become what Bourdieu called “symbolic capital”. Those who possess it will be more successful – whether or not those qualities are actually best, or bring something new to the job.

Of course, this is something that has always been the case in society. But artificial intelligence will only reinforce it – particularly when AI is fed data of the candidates who were successful in the past. This means companies are likely to hire the same types of people that they have always hired.
The big risk here is that those people are all from the same set of backgrounds. Algorithms leave little room for subjective appreciation, for risk-taking or for acting upon a feeling that a person should be given a chance. 
In addition, this technology may lead to the rejection of talented and innovative people who simply do not fit the profile of those who smile at the right moment or have the required tone of voice. And this may actually be bad for businesses in the long run as they risk missing out on talent that comes in unconventional forms. 
More concerning is that this technology may also inadvertently exclude people from diverse backgrounds and give more chances to those who come from privileged ones. As a rule, they possess greater economic and social capital, which allows them to obtain the skills that become symbolic capital in an interview setting.
What we see here is another manifestation of the more general issues with AI. Technology that is developed using data from our existing society, with its various inequalities and biases, is likely to reproduce them in the solutions and decisions that it proposes.

Correction: the headline of this article was amended to say facial analysis rather than facial recognition.

Advances in machine learning have transformed areas such as image and voice recognition, and the country’s big tech companies—Alibaba, Baidu, Huawei, and Tencent—have embraced the research and use of AI. A string of AI startups, including the four named at the top, have also ridden this wave to commercial riches by providing software for voice assistants, smart cities, autonomous vehicles, and more.Fannin says the potential for AI to drive economic growth, and the way Chinese companies like Huawei and TikTok are growing overseas, present a challenge to American tech dominance. “These are troubling issues for the US,” she says.Robert Ross, a professor who studies Chinese foriegn policy at Boston University, is more blunt. “I would say the president is using the situation with the Uighurs as a pretext,” he says. “It seems to be something of an effort to restrain China from developing AI technology, and from benefiting from US technology while it does that.”AdvertisementThe ban, announced after US markets closed Monday, prohibits the Chinese firms from doing business with US companies without a government-granted license.The move marks a shift in Trump’s trade battle with China, which has until now targeted tech companies over espionage and security rather than human rights.

In July, more than 20 countries pressured China through the UN Human Rights Council to stop detentions in Xinjiang. But the US was not involved, having withdrawn from the forum a year earlier. In addition, the White House has so far shown little interest in regulating facial regulation technology offered by US companies.Ross at Boston University says the ban may only cause China to dig its heels in over what it sees as a national security issue. “It's not at all clear that sanctions will help change the situation,” he says.Keep ReadingThe latest on artificial intelligence, from machine learning to computer vision and moreStill, the sanctions will be welcomed by those who have documented the disappearance and detention of more than a million people in Xinjiang, as well as widespread use of surveillance technology. “It’s showing tech companies they can’t do this sort of work and get away with it,” says Darren Byler, an anthropologist at the University of Washington who studies the Uighurs.The ban may also have a serious impact on the companies targeted, as well as some US suppliers. According to IPVM, a company that tracks the video surveillance industry, Hikvision and Dahua both depend heavily on technology from Intel, Nvidia, and other US suppliers. Hikvision has not been able to supply to US federal agencies since August due to a ban announced last year. According to IPVM, US sales had accounted for about 5 percent of the company’s $7 billion in annual revenue.Hikvision said in a statement that the restrictions “will deter global companies from communicating with the US government, hurt Hikvision’s US businesses partners, and negatively impact the US economy.”The AI companies added to the list also likely rely on US suppliers. According to a report published in February by the Center for New American Security, SenseTime operates computing infrastructure that includes 54 million graphical processing unit chips for training its AI algorithms. The most popular GPUs for AI training are designed by the American company Nvidia and manufactured by TSMC in Taiwan. Chinese alternatives from Alibaba, Huawei, and others are still in development.SenseTime lists Nvidia and another US chipmaker, Qualcomm, among its partners. The company is also collaborating with Honda on self-driving cars, and has funded an AI research project at MIT.A spokeswoman for SenseTime said the company has been preparing for a ban by diversifying its supply chain.

EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Confidence and investment in artificial intelligence (AI) to improve health care remain high, according to a new survey of 500 U.S. health industry leaders from hospitals, health plans, life sciences and employers, on their attitudes and adoption of the technology. Significantly, compared with 2018 findings, this year’s results found a nearly 88% increase in the number of respondents who said their organizations have a strategy in place and have implemented AI.

“At Optum, we apply what we call OptumIQ – a distinctive combination of curated data, analytics and health care expertise – to drive that intelligence transformation.”Post this

The second OptumIQ Annual Survey on AI in Health Care also reveals a shift in funding expectations for AI-related projects, as leaders estimate their organizations will invest an average of $39.7 million over the next five years – $7.3 million more than last year’s estimate.


“These findings validate that AI is vital to holistically transform health care. It’s encouraging to see executives’ growing trust in, and adoption of, AI to make data more actionable in making the health system work better for everyone,” said Dan Schumacher, president and chief operating officer of Optum. “Working together, I am confident we can improve the quality, experiences and reduce the total cost of health care in meaningful, sustainable ways.”


In addition, the survey found:



A positive return on investment (ROI) will take less time than previously expected, as little as three years in some cases. Half (50%) of respondents expect to see a tangible cost savings in three years or fewer as a result of investing in AI, compared with 31% in 2018. Among the respondent groups, more hospitals (55%) and health plans (52%) expect to see a positive return in less time – in three years or fewer – while life sciences executives (38%) anticipate it taking five years or longer.


Implementation has advanced. Sixty-two percent of respondents report having implemented an AI strategy – an increase of nearly 88% from 2018 (33%) – while 22% report being at late stages of implementation.


A higher level of trust in AI for administrative over clinical applications. While most respondents indicated high levels of trust in AI for both clinical and administrative tasks overall, when asked to rank specific applications, more administrative applications were selected (62%) over clinical applications (38%). In addition, when asked which health care applications, if any, they would feel comfortable having AI technology support, four out of five of the top-ranked applications were administrative.


Administrative process improvements top the list of investment priorities. Half (50%) of organizations will invest first in automating business processes, such as administrative tasks or customer service, while more than a third (36%) will invest in personalizing clinical care recommendations, such as drug therapies, and the same percentage (36%) also will invest in accelerating research for new therapeutic or clinical discoveries.



AI Seen as Most Pragmatic for Non-clinical Applications
In addition to noting the growing value of AI in the clinical environment, health care executives are looking to AI to solve a variety of operational and administrative challenges, such as automating pre-authorizations and personalizing care. The top five areas that organizations see AI as having potential are:



51% to automate prior authorizations


47% to provide individuals with relevant health actions using personalized communications


45% to manage electronic health records (EHRs)


43% to detect fraud, waste or abuse in reimbursement


38% to select appropriate care settings



AI to Create More Employment Opportunities and Drive Job Growth
As more organizations invest in and move forward with implementations, half (52%) of leaders expect AI to create more work opportunities. The majority (87%) agree that hiring candidates who have experience working with AI technology is a priority for their organization.


Most (89%) also agree employees are not being trained quickly enough to keep up with the growth of AI. In fact, 91% estimate that 10% to 50% of new roles will require experience working with AI. To solve this, they are evenly split among solutions such as establishing partnerships, creating training programs, working with consulting firms and postponing projects.


“In order to transform and modernize the U.S. health system through the power of AI, it is critical that organizations invest in developing talent throughout the enterprise to solve health care’s most complex challenges,” said Steve Griffiths, senior vice president and chief operating officer of Optum Enterprise Analytics. “At Optum, we apply what we call OptumIQ – a distinctive combination of curated data, analytics and health care expertise – to drive that intelligence transformation.”

When being empathetic is your full-time job, burning out is only human. Few people are more aware of this than customer service representatives, who are tasked with approaching each conversation with energy and compassion — whether it's their first call of the day or their 60th. It's their job to make even the most difficult customer feel understood and respected while still providing them accurate information. Oftentimes that's a tall order, resulting in frustration on both ends of the call. But over the last few years, an unlikely aide has come forward: artificial intelligence tools designed to help people tap into and maintain ""human"" characteristics like empathy and compassion. 



One of these tools is a platform called Cogito, named for the famous Descartes philosophy Cogito, ergo sum (""I think, therefore I am""). It's an AI platform that monitors sales and service calls for large corporations (among them, MetLife and Humana) and offers employees real-time feedback on customer interactions. During a call, an employee may see Cogito pop-up alerts on their screen encouraging them to display more empathy, increase their vocal energy, speak more slowly or respond more quickly. Interactions are scored and tracked on internal company dashboards, and managers can gauge, instantly, what different members of their team may need to work on. As a call center representative in MetLife's disability insurance department, Conor Sprouls uses Cogito constantly. On a typical day, he takes anywhere from 30 to 50 calls. Each one lasts between five and 45 minutes, depending on the complexity of the issue. Sprouls's first caller on the morning of Sept. 12, 2019, was someone with an anxiety disorder, and Cogito pinged Sprouls once with a reminder to be empathetic and a few times for being slow to respond (not uncommon when looking for documentation on someone's claim, explains Sprouls).When Cogito first rolled out, some employees were concerned about constant supervisor oversight and notification overload. They were getting pinged too often about the empathy cue, for example, and at one point, the tool thought a representative and a customer were talking over each other when they were in fact sharing a laugh. But Sprouls says that the system gets more intuitive with every call. As for over-supervision, call center conversations are always recorded and sent to supervisors, so it's not much of a change. In fact, Cogito may even offer a more realistic reflection of performance, says Sprouls. ""A supervisor can't be expected to listen to every single call for each of their associates, so sometimes when we're just choosing calls at random, it could be luck of the draw — one associate could be monitored on an easy call, and another could be monitored on a hard one,"" he says. ""Cogito is going to give you the end result: who needs to work on what. I think the way a lot of us really look at Cogito is as a personal job coach."" 


MetLife has been using Cogito for about two years, though it was first introduced in a pilot capacity. Emily Baker, a MetLife supervisor with a team of about 17, says that her associates all benefited from Cogito's cues during the pilot process. She says one associate's favorite was the energy cue; he'd start slouching in his seat at the end of the day, and the posture meant he didn't project his voice as much. When the energy cue appeared (a coffee cup icon), he sat up straight and spoke more energetically so that he appeared more engaged in the call.""I like the fact that I can see overall, on my particular supervisor dashboard, how we're doing as a team, if there are any trends,"" Baker says. ""Is everybody speaking over the caller? Is everybody having trouble with dead air? You can drill down into each person, and it's really good for coaching one-on-one."" Now, MetLife is in the process of rolling out Cogito across even more of its customer-facing departments — claims, direct sales, customer growth. The company also plans to more than double the number of employees using the platform (from 1,200 to over 3,000). ""It's a little bit of a strange dynamic,"" says Kristine Poznanski, head of global customer solutions at MetLife. ""We're using technology and artificial intelligence to help our associates demonstrate more human behavior. It's something you don't intuitively think about."" A growing trend At his consulting job in the New Zealand Department of Child and Family, Josh Feast, co-founder and CEO of Cogito, says he learned that social workers could experience burnout in as few as three to five years. He was shocked by the irony — that a profession designed to care for people wasn't conducive to caring for the people in that profession. An idea began to form, and it took further shape after a course at MIT's Media Lab, during which Feast had a key revelation: Big organizations understand data well, so if he wanted to help people inside a large organization, he needed to present his idea in a language the corporate team could understand. ""It was almost like being hit by a lightning strike,"" he says. And so Cogito was born. In the R&D phase, Feast and his co-founder worked for DARPA, the U.S. government's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. The agency had in mind soldiers struggling with PTSD, and DARPA provided the Cogito team with funding to research aid for psychological distress. So Feast began studying how nurses interacted with patients. 


""There was a real ""aha' moment where we discovered that if you could use that technology to understand the conversation — and to measure the conversational dance between nurse and patient — you could start getting a read of the degree of empathy and compassion they displayed ... and the resulting attitude the patient had to that interaction,"" says Feast. He built dashboards to display measures of compassion and empathy, and he found something noteworthy: When people were given real-time feedback while speaking with someone, levels of compassion and empathy during the conversation improved. That realization was the key to Cogito's future. But Cogito isn't the only AI-powered tool aiming to help us tap into our humanity. ButterflyThere's Butterfly, an AI tool that aims to help managers empathize with their employees and increase workplace happiness. After Butterfly is embedded into a workplace messaging system, it functions as a chatbot — executive-coaching managers in real-time based on employee surveys and feedback. Butterfly analyzes the latter to measure levels of stress, collaboration, conflict, purpose, creativity and the like. Then, it provides managers with calls to action and reading materials to help them deal with problems on their team. For example, an executive with a highly-stressed team might receive an article on how to create a more compassionate work environment. ""In a nutshell, Butterfly was created in order to help managers to be on point when it comes to their… team's level of engagement and overall happiness,"" says co-founder and CEO David Mendlewicz. ""Think about an AI-driven happiness assistant or AI-driven leadership coach."" SupportivAnother AI-powered empathy tool is Supportiv, a peer counseling platform aiming to use natural language processing to take on daily mental health struggles such as work stress, anxiety, loneliness and conflicts with loved ones. Seconds after a user answers Supportiv's primary question — ""What's your struggle?"" — they're sorted into an anonymous, topic-specific peer support group. 


Each group has a trained live moderator (who is also equipped to refer specialized or emergency services as needed), and an AI algorithm scans conversations to detect mood, tone, engagement and interaction patterns. On the moderator's side, prompts pop up — user X hasn't contributed to the conversation in a while, or user Y shared a thought above that hasn't been addressed. Co-founder Helena Plater-Zyberk's vision for Supportiv's next iteration: additional AI advances that could help identify isolated users in chats and alert moderators with suggestions on how to be more empathetic towards those individuals. The aim, says Plater-Zyberk, is to create ""superhuman moderators"" — using compassion, empathy and hyper-alertness to facilitate a group chat better than any normally-equipped human. IBM's Project DebaterFinally, when it comes to the theory ""I think, therefore I am,"" IBM's Project Debater fits the bill. Introduced by the tech giant in January, it's billed as the first AI system that can debate complex ideas with humans. At its core, Debater is about rational thinking and empathy — considering opposing points of view and understanding an opponent enough to be able to address their argument piece-by-piece and ultimately win them over. Dr. Aya Soffer, vice president of AI tech at IBM Research, envisions a variety of real-world applications for Debater — a policymaker who wants to understand the range of implications for a law they're considering. For example, in the case of banning phones from schools (a law the French government passed in 2018), what are the precedents, the pros and cons, the arguments on both sides of the equation? A financial analyst or investment advisor might use Debater to make smart projections about what a new type of technology may or may not mean for the market. We typically look for supporting arguments in order to convince ourselves, or someone else, of something. But Soffer says that taking counterarguments into account could be even more powerful, whether to change a mind or strengthen a pre-existing view. That kind of empathy and higher-level logical thinking is something IBM Debater aims to help with.Pitfalls and privacy As is the case with all new technology, this type has some concerning use cases. First, there's the potential for system bias in the data used to train the algorithm. For example, if it's taught using cases of predominantly white men expressing empathy, that could yield a system that charts lower output for women and minorities. A call center representative with a medical condition might display less energy than the perceived norm but does their best to make up for it in other ways. 


That's why it's a good idea for individuals to be provided this data before it's shared with their supervisors, says Rosalind Picard, founder and director of the Affective Computing Research Group at the MIT Media Lab. She believes it's a breach of ethics to share data on an employee's interactions, such as levels of compassion, empathy and energy, with a manager first. And then there's the temptation for this type of technology to go beyond its intended use case — a helpful reminder to facilitate a genuine connection — and instead serve as a driver for insincere interactions fueled by fear. After all, similar tech tools are part of the foundation of social ratings systems (think Black Mirror's ""Nosedive"" episode). In 2020, China plans to debut publicly available social credit scores for every citizen. That score will help determine an individual's eligibility for an apartment, which travel deals they're offered, which schools they may enroll their children in and even whether they can see a hospital doctor without lining up to pay first. Within the next five years, experts predict we'll make great strides in ""sentiment analysis"" — a type of natural language processing that identifies human emotions by analyzing facial expressions and body language or text responses. But for Noah Goodman, associate professor at Stanford University's Computation and Cognition Lab, there's a moral dilemma involved: What's the right thing to do with the information these systems learn? Should they have goals — prompt us, adjust our environments or send us tools to make us feel happier, more compassionate, more empathetic? What should the technology do with data on our feelings towards someone else, our performance in any given interaction? And who should it make that information available to? ""This is a place where the creepiness boundary is always close,"" says Goodman.  Another problem? AI simply can't replicate, or fully comprehend, human emotion. Take Cogito, for example. Let's say you're a customer service representative on the phone with customers all day, and you receive an alert that you're sounding low-energy and tired instead of high-energy and alert. That doesn't mean you're actually feeling tired, says Picard, and that's an important distinction to make. ""It doesn't know how I feel,"" says Picard. ""It has no consciousness — it's simply saying that to this system listening to your vocal quality, compared to your usual vocal quality and compared to other people on the phone at this company's vocal quality, here is how you might sound, according to the data we've collected… It's not to say you are that way."" There's a misunderstanding that we're already at the point where AI effectively understands human feelings, rather than just being able to analyze data and recognize patterns related to them. The phrase ""artificial intelligence"" itself may propagate that misunderstanding, says Picard, so to avoid fueling public fear about the future of AI, she recommends calling it software instead. ""As soon as we call the software ""AI,' a lot of people think it's doing more than it is,"" she says. ""When we say the machine ""learns' and that it's ""learned something' what we mean is that we've trained a big chunk of mathematics to take a bunch of inputs and make a mathematical function that produces a set of outputs with them. It doesn't ""learn' or ""know' or ""feel' or ""think' anything like any of us do. It's not alive."" 


Implications and regulationsSome experts believe there will come a day when technology will be able to understand and replicate ""uniquely human"" characteristics. The idea falls under the ""computational theory of the mind"" — that the brain is a dedicated tool for processing information, and even complex emotions like compassion and empathy can be charted as data. But even if that's true, there's a difference between experiencing emotion and understanding it — and in Goodman's view, it'll one day be entirely possible to build AI systems that have a good understanding of people's emotions without actually experiencing emotions themselves. There's also the idea that throughout the course of history, fear has often accompanied the release of new technology. ""We're always afraid of something new coming out, specifically if it has a large technological component,"" says Mendlewicz. ""Exactly the same fear rose up when the first telegraph came… and when the telegraph was replaced by the phone, people were also expressing fear… about [it] making us less human — having to communicate to a machine."" One of the most important questions to ask: How do we avoid this being used to alienate people or to create more distance between human beings? One prime example is social media platforms, which were introduced to augment human connectivity but paradoxically ended up as tools of polarization. ""What we've learned from that is that human connectivity and the humanity of technology should not be assumed; it needs to be cultivated,"" says Rumman Chowdhury, who leads Accenture's Responsible AI initiative. ""Instead of figuring out how we fit around technology, we need to figure out how technology fits around us."" That also means watching out for red flags, including the tech ""solutionism"" fallacy — the idea that technology can solve any and all of humanity's problems. Although it can't do that, technology can point out things we need to focus on in order to work towards more overarching solutions. ""We as human beings have to be willing to do the hard work,"" says Chowdhury. ""Empathy doesn't just happen because an AI told you to be more empathetic ... [Let's say] I create an AI to read through your emails and tell you if you sound kind enough and, if not, fix your emails for you so that you sound kind. That doesn't make your a nicer person; it doesn't make you more empathetic... The creation of any of this AI that involves improving human beings needs to be designed very thoughtfully, so that human beings are doing the work."" Some of that work involves building systems to regulate this type of AI before it's widespread, and experts have already begun floating ideas. For any AI tool, Chris Sciacca, communications manager for IBM Research, would like to see an ""AI Fact Sheet"" that functions like a nutrition label on a loaf of bread, including data such as who trained the algorithm, when and which data they used. It's a way to look ""under the hood"" — or even inside the black box — of an AI tool, understand why it might have come to a certain conclusion and remember to take its results with a grain of salt. He says IBM is working on standardizing and promoting such a practice. 


Picard suggests regulations akin to those for lie detection tests, such as the Federal Employee Polygraph Protection Act, passed in 1988. Under a similar law, it stands to reason that employers would be unable to require AI communication monitoring tools, with few exceptions — and that even in those cases, they couldn't monitoring someone without informing them about the technology and their rights. Spencer Gerrol, CEO of Spark Neuro — a neuroanalytics company that aims to measure emotion and attention for advertisers — says the potential implications for this kind of empathetic AI keep him up at night. Facebook may have created ""amazing"" tech, he says, but it also contributed to meddling in the U.S. elections. And when it comes to devices that can read emotions based on your brain activity, consequences could be even more dire, especially since much of emotion is subconscious. That means that one day, a device could feasibly be more ""aware"" of your emotions than you yourself are. ""The ethics of that will become complex,"" says Gerrol, especially once advertisers attempt to persuade individuals to take action by leveraging what's known about their emotions. As for the founder of Cogito himself? Feast believes that over the next five to 10 years, AI tools will split into two categories: Virtual agents that complete tasks on our behalf.Intelligent augmentation, or services built around reinforcing or extending our own human capabilities. Feast envisions more of a meld between man and machine, tools that we'll deem necessary to help us perform the way we want to in particular settings. These types of tools, he says, will ""extend and reinforce our humanness.""

This Institute for Public Relations (IPR) 2019 Future of Work Report investigates the future of work and the impact of several factors on the changing nature of work, including a rapidly and continuously shifting technological landscape, the growth of globalization, and the juxtaposition of new and tenured members of the workforce. While some technological innovations have already made a significant impact on organizations, the future of work is more than just artificial intelligence (AI) and automation. The intent of this project was to investigate the three interlinked dimensions of an organization: the work (the what), the workforce (the who), and the workplace (the where). Each offers unique challenges and opportunities for organizational (internal) communication.
The 2019 IPR Future of Work Report arose from a need to
understand current and continuous forces of change impacting organizational
operations and communication. The report focuses on the disruptions in the
workforce, how organizations are dealing with those changes, and how organizations
are communicating to a diverse and evolving workforce.
 
For this report, IPR interviewed 25 executives responsible
for organizational/internal communication to determine how they are
strategizing around this new reality. To protect confidentiality, interviewees’
identities are white-labeled. Interviews were transcribed, and thematic
analysis was conducted using a process of open and axial coding.
Three meta-themes framed the report’s findings:
•            The future
of work in a global, technology-driven reality;
•            Reaching a
diversifying workforce;
•            Investing
in employees for the future of work.

Dr. Lukasik, director of the department’s research division, strove to apply advanced technology to national defense.Credit...Department of DefenseBy Katie HafnerOct. 7, 2019Stephen Lukasik, a physicist who oversaw crucial work on national security and computer networking as director of the Defense Department’s research division in the late 1960s and early ’70s, died on Thursday at his home in Falls Church, Va. He was 88.The cause was respiratory failure, his wife, Virginia, said. Dr. Lukasik (pronounced loo-KAY-sik) spent eight years at the department’s Advanced Research Projects Agency, known as ARPA, a period when great strides were made in detecting and controlling weapons of mass destruction — particularly nuclear devices — as well as in computer networking and artificial intelligence.Dr. Lukasik’s work at ARPA helped spur the growth of a worldwide network of seismographs to detect nuclear explosions, helping to plant the seeds for what became the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in 1996.He was an ardent champion of using advanced technology to promote national defense, including the Arpanet, the precursor to the internet, which was built during his tenure as ARPA director.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIn a 1991 interview with the University of Minnesota’s Charles Babbage Institute, Dr. Lukasik said that one of his major goals was to transfer ARPA’s work to the military services. “Whatever it is you’re trying to do, it’s got to get out of the research labs,” he said.ImageStephen Lukasik in 1971. “Why don’t you guys do something interesting? Like, fixing it so computers can understand speech?” he told a group of artificial intelligence researchers.Credit...Department of DefenseHe required ARPA researchers to develop technology with applications to military command and control systems. “It wasn’t just, ‘Gee whiz,’ and patting them on the back,” he said. “It was understanding what they’re doing, grasping its implications and relating that to the world of problems that the Defense Department either had or would be facing.”

How The Times decides who gets an obituary. There is no formula, scoring system or checklist in determining the news value of a life. We investigate, research and ask around before settling on our subjects. If you know of someone who might be a candidate for a Times obituary, please suggest it here.Learn more about our process.Dr. Lukasik’s interest in artificial intelligence, for example, was driven by his national security concerns. In the early 1970s, while attending a meeting of ARPA-funded A.I. researchers, he grew impatient.“I said, ‘Why don’t you guys do something interesting? Like, fixing it so computers can understand speech?’” he said in the Babbage interview.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTHis incentive at the time, he wrote in a reminiscence, was to assist the National Security Agency, which employed “vast numbers of transcribers and translators to make sense of a multitude of communication channels they monitored.” In one instance he had ARPA researchers work on using artificial intelligence to transcribe manual Morse code.“In my view, he was one of the few people who really thought about how science and technology serve national security,” said Sharon Weinberger, author of “The Imagineers of War: The Untold Story of DARPA, the Pentagon Agency That Changed the World” (2017). “He saw the role of strategy, not just widgets or weapons to serve the Pentagon, but the bigger picture around it.”Dr. Lukasik was an early champion of the Arpanet, which began as an experiment in computer networking. His contribution to the Arpanet, he wrote in 2014, “was helping to wrench this R&D project away from its creators, who would have liked to research it forever,” in part to promote military innovation.Dr. Lukasik began using electronic mail in its earliest versions in 1973; indeed, he became known for running ARPA largely by email. Yet email also vexed him. Not one to throw anything away, he grew frustrated by the email piling up in his inbox.He complained to Lawrence Roberts, who ran ARPA’s Information Processing Techniques Office. “I said, ‘Larry, this email is great, but it’s a mess!’” he recalled in an interview for “Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins of the Internet” (1996). “In typical Larry fashion he came in the next day, and said, ‘Steve, I wrote some code for you.’” It was the first email management program.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTStephen Joseph Lukasik was born on March 19, 1931, in Staten Island to Stephen and Mildred (Tynan) Lukasik. His father was an accountant, his mother a bank employee.Stephen began reading scientific literature at age 10 and at 14 knew what direction his career would take after reading newspaper accounts of the atomic bomb attacks on Japan.“I was really horrified by the human losses at Hiroshima and Nagasaki,” Dr. Lukasik said in an interview for this obituary in March. “So I read everything that I could and decided that, of all the sciences, physics was the one that answered the questions I wanted to know about.” At 16 he entered Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., where he received a bachelor’s degree in physics in 1951. He received his Ph.D., also in physics, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1956.While at Rensselaer, he met Marilyn Trappiel, a chemistry student at nearby Russell Sage College. They married in 1953 and divorced in 1982.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTIn 1955, while a doctoral student, Dr. Lukasik joined the Westinghouse Electric Corporation as a scientist at the company’s Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory, outside Pittsburgh. His work attracted the attention of the Defense Department, and he joined ARPA in 1966 as director for nuclear test detection. He became the agency’s overall director in 1971.After leaving ARPA, he worked in security-related positions at the RAND Corporation, Northrop, TRW and elsewhere. He became chief scientist at the Federal Communications Commission in 1979.While at the F.C.C., he met Virginia Dogan Armstrong, a policy analyst. They married in 1983. In addition to her, his survivors include four children from his first marriage, Carol Ward, Elizabeth O’Masta and Gregory and Jeffrey Lukasik; two stepchildren, Elizabeth Armstrong Parker and Alan Armstrong; 11 grandchildren; and 3 great-grandchildren.So abiding was Dr. Lukasik’s interest in national security and technology that he amassed a personal library of about 10,000 books relating to every dimension of those subjects.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTInternet security breaches remained a worry. “Even if by some miracle governments and industry worldwide were to agree on a course of action to remove threats to the net,” he wrote in 2011, “groups such as criminals benefiting from the current state of insecurity are unlikely to cooperate.”Anthony Rutkowski, a longtime colleague, recounted that while on a flight home from a meeting in Europe 18 years ago, he read a draft of a paper that Dr. Lukasik had given him. In it, Dr. Lukasik outlined ways that the internet could be used to coordinate a major infrastructure attack on the United States.“The detail was stunning,” Mr. Rutkowski recalled. The date was Sept. 11, 2001. His plane turned around, mid-Atlantic, and returned to Europe.Katie Hafner, a former staff reporter for The New York Times, is the author of ""Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins of The Internet.""

Artificial Intelligence (AI) in general and machine learning (ML) in particular, is not a new concept, but it is only in recent years that financial services firms have started to learn about and understand its full potential.
AI systems can be designed to learn to adapt behaviour by analysing how the environment is affected by previous actions. As a scientific discipline, AI includes several approaches and techniques, such as machine learning, machine reasoning, and robotics.
Now is a good time to start building greater knowledge and awareness in this area. The technology has moved beyondunrealistic fantasy to real business applications. At the same time, processes and approaches in the AI space have not yet been finalised.It is vital to ensure that any adoption of ML and associated technologies is valuable in the long-term without producing unacceptable side-effects for organisations and society.
EU and international regulators have also taken an active interest in AI, and while they recognise the benefits that AI can bring to financial markets, consumers, and their own work, they are increasingly mindful of the potential risks and unintended consequences that the use of AI by regulated firms may have.
AI raises profound questions across ethical, legal and regulatory domains, touching many fronts, from protecting national security and citizen rights to advancing commercial interests and international standing.
The European Commission has put forward a European approach to artificial intelligence and robotics and is well placed to establish a distinctive form of AI that is ethically robust and protects the rights of individuals, firms and society. It deals with technological, ethical, legal and socio-economic aspects to boost EU's research and industrial capacity and to put AI at the service of European citizens and economy. Base on this EU approach, Cyprus is developing a national strategy document for Artificial Intelligence for the country. The effort is organized by the Department of Electronic Communications, of the Ministry of Transport, Communications and Works.

Given that Accountancy firms traditionallyare compiling, organising, analysing and reporting on huge quantities of business and financial data, they are the leaders in the creation of new methodologies and technological tools for analysis.
To date, there has been limited use in real-world accounting, but early research and implementation projects include:
• using machine learning to code accounting entries and improve on the accuracy of rules-based approaches, enabling greater automation of processes;
• improving fraud detection through more sophisticated, machine learning models of ‘normal’ activities and better prediction of fraudulent activities;and
• using machine learning-based predictive models to forecast revenues;
In order to build a positive vision of the future, we need to develop a deep understanding of how AI can solveaccounting and business problems, the practical challenges and the skills accountants need to work alongside intelligent systems.

October 2019        

Why is the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) technology so important in material recovery facility (MRF) operations? Some of the biggest challenges of recycling sorting is that it is still a very costly, manual process. Most facilities are run chronically understaffed due to low unemployment. [With AI technology], we can sustainably replace very scarce labor, pick faster, more accurately, around the clock at a sustained rate with little operational upkeep. Lastly, with computer vision and machine learning, we are capturing and sharing data on material streams enabling recycling operations to gain transparency on the value of their lines, as well as measure productivity. How does AI work on a practical level? Matanya Horowitz CEO, AMP RoboticsAI is the process of getting information and applying rules for using this information, applying logic, self-correction and learning to execute a task. The core problem that AMP has solved is teaching a machine to distinguish individual objects that may be dirty, smashed or torn in the midst of a very cluttered environment. That identification problem is quite difficult, as it means the machine must truly understand what makes a carton different than PET (polyethylene terephthalate), which is different than HDPE (high-density polyethylene), despite all of the variations that may be present. With artificial intelligence we solved this with the development of AMP Neuron™, our AI platform. What are the main uses for AI and robotics in the recycling industry? Using advanced computer vision and machine learning, the platform trains itself by processing millions of material images. It teaches itself to look for different visual attributes such as size, color and texture. It learns many of the same things a person would learn: PET is shiny, and aluminum has a gray circle on the bottom. Due to the learning-based approach, it learns from experience, not only getting better, but also identifying more specific categories of material. AMP Neuron can identify distinct materials with AI and discern what to do with each fraction, guiding robots within our AMP Cortex™ system to precisely sort consistently at a much faster rate and with greater accuracy than a person. How does the incorporation of robotic technology affect manual sorting operations? The modularity of our AMP Cortex™ robotic sorting system drops into the general footprint of a sorting station, making it incredibly scalable by adapting to existing operations. The installation is intended to be done within existing operations without costly retrofit and extended downtime, often over a weekend. We train on a given operation’s material stream in advance to jumpstart the integration, striving to be up and running as soon as possible. As far as working with or replacing manual sortation, it really depends on the customer operation and their goals. Our systems are designed and scalable to solve the labor challenge overall as a replacement. But due to the system’s modularity, robots can co-locate with manual sortation as well. Where do you see AI technology headed? We see a future (and it is happening fast) where facilities are increasingly automated at low cost, reducing operational friction and creating even more value. We also see the potential for new types of high-value commodity categories created as our AI is precise down to the consumer packaged good (CPG) brand level and even the UPC and SKU level. As our technology constantly adapts to new material types in the stream even more value will be created for the circular economy and its stakeholders.

Automation and AI are coming for jobs — and African American workers are particularly at risk.African American workers will have higher rates of job displacement than the general US population due to automation, according to a new report by the consultancy McKinsey. ""There is an elevated risk to the African American workforce to modernization, automation, and the global shift that exists in this modern economy,"" McKinsey partner and report co-author Jason Wright tells Business Insider.

While 22% of all jobs in the total workforce will get ""disrupted,"" meaning either killed or replaced by lower-paying work, it's 10% higher for the African American workforce. That means 4.5 million black jobs could be displaced by 2030 without any intervention, according to McKinsey.

Read more: 8 startling facts that show just how hard the student-debt crisis is hurting black AmericansAfrican American workers are at greater risk for job loss due to being overrepresented in the jobs that will face the most cuts after AI and automation take over, like office support secretaries, fast-food and service workers, and  mechanics and other practitioners of production work. About 34% to 36% of jobs in those three sectors will get disrupted, McKinsey says.The disproportionate impact of automation could exacerbate the already widening racial wealth gap. The wealth gap between the median black and white families in the US has jumped $54,000 since 1992. White Americans own disproportionately more homes and hold less student debt than African Americans — factors that can be traced to historic redlining and discrimination in job hiring.Automation and AI will impact black men and black women differently.College education and gender will all impact how severely black Americans will face job loss, McKinsey finds.

While the general black population is 10% more at risk for job disruption, the number jumps to 30% for African American men without a college degree. In fact, the researchers estimate that 28% of jobs held by black men without a college degree will get disrupted by automation and AI by 2030.Interestingly, while black men face greater risk of job disruption from AI, black women will see relatively fewer job losses. Black women might lose jobs at a lower rate not only compared to black men, but also when compared to white and Asian Americans of all genders.Black women are currently overrepresented in jobs that will see growth in the next decade, like nursing assistants and home health aides. However, black and Hispanic women are still paid the least out of every racial-gender pairing.

Wright said understanding the unique ways automation will impact different racial-gender groups will allow for better understanding of which policies to advocate for. Black men might need more job re-skilling training to prepare for job disruption, while black women might need better access to education to attain higher-paying work.""There's a real benefit to the evolution the economy is going through,"" he said. ""Being smart, especially as a person of color, on the unique risk to you is helpful.""

That means 4.5 million black jobs could be displaced by 2030 without any intervention, according to McKinsey.Read more: 8 startling facts that show just how hard the student-debt crisis is hurting black AmericansAfrican American workers are at greater risk for job loss due to being overrepresented in the jobs that will face the most cuts after AI and automation take over, like office support secretaries, fast-food and service workers, and  mechanics and other practitioners of production work. About 34% to 36% of jobs in those three sectors will get disrupted, McKinsey says.The disproportionate impact of automation could exacerbate the already widening racial wealth gap.

How the story began
The story began 15 years ago when a group of developers founded a small IT company and started to work on the introduction of quantitative methods of investment research based on the experience of scientists in the field of theoretical physics, applied mathematics and programming in the financial markets. Today Quant Infinity is an international group of IT-companies focused on developing software for quantitative trading on international financial markets. It has over 15 years of experience in product development for financial companies, 8 years of which were spent successfully developing and installing automated trading systems. Investment hedge funds, trust companies, banks, and family offices implement Quant Infinity solutions for managing either their own funds or for providing asset management services to clients under their own brand (White Label). Quant Infinity services are already used by financial companies in Europe and Asia.
What is Quantitative Investing, and how does it work?

Quantitative investing emerged in the United States in the 1970s. Edward Thorpe, an American professor of mathematics at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), is considered to be the founder of this trend. In his research on the movement of quotes on the stock exchange, he concluded that it is possible to predict changes in asset prices with the help of the probability theory, predictive analytics and the law of large numbers.
Thorpe used his developments in his first quantitative investment fund, founded in late 1969. Over the next 18 years, he turned $1.4 million into $273 million. His Princeton Newport Partners (1969-1988, with an average income of 19.1% per year) and Ridgeline (1994-2002, with an average income of 21%, with a volatility of 7%) were beyond the reach of traditional managers of that time.
In the 1970s, for investors accustomed to investing in traditional instruments on financial advisers’ guidance, Thorpe’s method appeared to be like predicting the future. However, over two decades, many hedge funds, major banks, and other financial companies in the US actively began to apply this method. Citadel, QIM, TwoSigma are the most well-known companies among them. The method has been utilized as well by some investment departments at the largest US banks like JPMorgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, and others.
 Quantitative funds today 
By the end of the first quarter of 2019, the total assets under the management of hedge funds reached USD 3.0113 trillion. According to Global Hedge Fund Industry Outlook 2019, the largest funds which use quantitative methods of investing demonstrated significant growth over the period 2013-2018. The volume of assets under the management of these funds is more than USD 1 trillion.

Predictive analysis, probability theory, Big Data, and Artificial Intelligence used for analysis and prediction in quantitative funds. The best of these funds present impressive results on a long horizon. For example, the average annual return of Renaissance Technologies by Jim Simons (the founder of the most successful hedge fund according to Forbes) for the last 30 years was 40% per annum. Even the total average return of all quantitative funds exceeds traditional hedge funds´ return. Between 2012-2017, the average return of quantitative funds was 5.1% per year, while the average return of “traditional” hedge funds was 4.3% per year.
How to profit from this

The Quant Infinity solution is an international algorithmic trading strategy developed in 2011 which is being constantly improved by a team of mathematicians. Since the beginning the strategy has been continuously developed. The results, which are regularly confirmed by an international audit company are above 35% p.a. in average. For risk-averse investors, the volatility of the strategy can easily be down-scaled, thus still offering pure alpha creation. The strategy has always been among the top 10 international rankings of Barclay Hedge and EurekaHedge in terms of return on par with the largest international funds.
The strategy currently encompassed more than 7´000 bots which are all being run and monitored automatically. The quality of each individual bot is essentially determined by its return per risk and is conventionally measured via the Sharpe ratio.  Mathematically, the Sharpe ratio is defined as the ratio of the annualized mean return to the annualized standard deviation of returns. The higher the Sharpe ratio, the smoother the track record of the individual bot. It is directly linked to the probability of generating a positive return over a given horizon of time. Over the last 4 years, the Sharpe ratio of the Quant Infinity strategy is 1.27.  As a benchmark, over the last 4 years the Sharpe ratio of the S&P 500 Index is 0.72.  Under these circumstances the probability to achieve a positive result over the next 2 years is 92.9% for the Quant Infinity strategy and only 83.5% for the S&P500 Index.*
* The Sharpe ratio of the strategy was calculated using Composite track record since 01.07.2015. The Sharp Ratio of S&P500 Index was calculated using open sources since 01.07.2015.
