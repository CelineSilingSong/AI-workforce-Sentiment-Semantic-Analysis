The era of artificial intelligence is already upon us, and it's found its home in the cloud.
Artificial intelligence (AI) assists in the automation of routine activities within IT infrastructure, which increases productivity. The combination of AI and cloud computing results in an extensive network capable of holding massive volumes of data while continuously learning and improving.







With tools available from top public cloud providers, such as IBM Watson, Google Cloud Vertex AI, Microsoft Azure AI and the AWS AI services portfolio, advanced AI and machine learning capabilities are more readily available to enterprises. Learn how AI can benefit your enterprises, as well as areas to watch out for.

The benefits of AI in cloud computing
AI has changed the cloud landscape in the following ways:


Lower costs
A big advantage of cloud computing  is that it eliminates costs related to on-site data centers, such as hardware and maintenance. Those upfront costs can be prohibitive with AI projects, but in the cloud enterprises can instantly access these tools for a monthly fee, making research- and development-related costs more manageable. Additionally, AI tools can gain insights from the data and analyze it without human intervention.
Intelligent automation
Enterprises use the power of AI-driven cloud computing to be more efficient, strategic and insight-driven. AI can automate complex and repetitive tasks to boost productivity, as well as perform data analysis without any human intervention. IT teams can also use AI to manage and monitor core workflows. IT teams can focus more on strategic operations while AI performs the mundane tasks. For example, IBM Cloud Pak for Automation provides prebuilt workflows for AI-powered automation.

See how AI has progressed.





Deeper insights
AI can identify patterns and trends in vast data sets. It uses historical data and compares it to the most recent data, which provides IT teams with well-informed, data-backed intelligence. On top of that, AI tools can perform data analysis fast so enterprises can rapidly and efficiently address customer queries and issues. The observations and valuable advice gained from AI capabilities result in quicker and more accurate results. For example, an app developer can use Amazon Personalize to give customers real-time personalized recommendations.
Improved data management
AI plays a significant role in processing, managing and structuring data. AI can significantly boost marketing, customer care and supply chain data management with more reliable real-time data. AI tools streamline how data is ingested, modified and managed. For example, IT teams can imbed AI tools into Google Cloud Stream analytics to get real-time personalization, detect anomalies and predict maintenance scenarios.
Increased security
As enterprises deploy more applications in the cloud, intelligent data security is crucial to keep data safe. IT teams can use AI-powered network security tools to track and evaluate network traffic. AI-powered systems can raise a flag as soon as they find an anomaly. This proactive approach helps prevent any damage to critical data. For example, Amazon GuardDuty is an intelligent threat detection tool that uses AI and machine learning to find potential risks.

Add AI to your cloud security strategy.







The downsides of AI in cloud computing
While combining AI with cloud computing provides numerous benefits, there are drawbacks as well. For example, while it can lower costs, AI is complex and may require a well-trained staff, which can cost more money upfront. The following are the other downsides to using AI in cloud computing environments:
Connectivity concerns
Cloud-based machine learning systems need consistent internet connectivity. IT teams use the internet to send raw data to the cloud service and recover processed data. Poor internet access can hinder the advantages of cloud-based machine learning algorithms.
While processing data in the cloud is quicker than conventional computing, there is a time lag between transmitting data to the cloud and receiving responses. This is a significant issue when using machine learning algorithms for cloud servers, where prediction speed is one of the primary concerns.
Data privacy
AI applications require a large amount of data, which can include consumer and vendor information. For example, Amazon provides recommendations based on purchase history. While some data can be anonymous and can't be tied to personally identifiable information, knowing who the data belongs to makes it more valuable. When sensitive information is used, data protection and compliance is a major concern. Enterprises need to create privacy policies and secure all data when using AI in cloud computing.

 Artificial intelligence is disrupting and revolutionizing almost every industry. With advancing technology, it has the potential to improve so many aspects of life drastically. 



 But, it isn’t without risk. 





 And, with swathes of experts warning of the potential danger of AI, we should probably pay attention. On the other hand, many claim that these are alarmist views and that there’s no immediate danger from AI. 

 So, are concerns about artificial intelligence alarmist or not? This article will cover the five main risks of artificial intelligence, explaining the currently available technology in these areas. 


 How Can AI Be Dangerous? 
    

 AI is growing more sophisticated by the day, and this can have risks ranging from mild (for example, job disruption) to catastrophic existential risks. The level of risk imposed by AI is so heavily debated because there’s a general lack of understanding (and consensus) regarding AI technology. 





 It is generally thought that AI can be dangerous in two ways: 

 The AI is programmed to do something malicious  The AI is programmed to be beneficial but does something destructive while achieving its goal  

 These risks are amplified by the sophistication of AI software. The classic hypothetical argument is the facetious “paper clip maximizer.” In this thought experiment, a superintelligent AI has been programmed to maximize the number of paper clips in the world. If it’s sufficiently intelligent, it could destroy the entire world for this goal. 

 But, we don’t need to consider superintelligent AI to see that there are dangers already associated with our use of AI. So, what are some of the immediate risks we face from AI? 



 1. Job Automation and Disruption 
    





 Automation is a danger of AI that is already affecting society. 

 From mass production factories to self-serve checkouts to self-driving cars, automation has been occurring for decades—and the process is accelerating. A Brookings Institution study in 2019 found that 36 million jobs could be at a high risk of automation in the coming years. 

 The issue is that for many tasks, AI systems outperform humans. They are cheaper, more efficient, and more accurate than humans. For example, AI is already better at recognizing art forgery than human experts, and it’s now becoming more accurate at diagnosing tumors from radiography imagery. 

 The further problem is that, with job displacement following automation, many of the workers who lost their jobs are ineligible for newly created jobs in the AI sector due to lacking the required credentials or expertise. 






 As AI systems continue to improve, they will become far more adept at tasks than humans. This could be in pattern recognition, providing insights, or making accurate predictions. The resulting job disruption could result in increased social inequality and even an economic disaster. 



 2. Security and Privacy 
 In 2020, the UK government commissioned a report on Artificial Intelligence and UK National Security, which highlighted the necessity of AI in the UK’s cybersecurity defenses to detect and mitigate threats that require a greater speed of response than human decision-making is capable of. 

 The problem is that the hope is that as AI-driven security concerns rise, so do AI-driven prevention measures. Unless we can develop measures to protect ourselves against AI concerns, we run the risk of running a never-ending race against bad actors. 

 This also begs the question of how we make AI systems secure themselves. If we use AI algorithms to defend against various security concerns, we need to ensure that the AI itself is secure against bad actors. 





 When it comes to privacy, large companies and governments are already being called out for the erosion of our privacy. With so much personal data available online now (2.5 million terabytes of data is created daily), AI algorithms are already able to easily create user profiles that enable extremely accurate targeting of advertisements. 

 Facial recognition technology is also already incredibly sophisticated. Cameras can perform real-time profiling of individuals. Some police forces worldwide reportedly use smart glasses with facial recognition software that can easily label wanted or suspected criminals. 

 The risk is that this technology could be expanded to authoritarian regimes or simply individuals or groups with malicious intents. 



 3. AI Malware 
    





 AI is becoming increasingly good at hacking security systems and cracking encryption. One way this is occurring is via malware “evolving” through machine learning algorithms. The malware can learn what works through trial and error, becoming more dangerous over time. 

 Newer smart technology (like self-driving cars) has been assessed as a high-risk target for this kind of attack, with the potential for bad actors to cause car crashes or gridlocks. As we become more and more reliant on internet-connected smart technology, more and more of our daily lives will be impacted by the risk of disruption. 

 Again, the only real solution to this danger is that anti-malware AI outperforms malicious AI to protect individuals and businesses. 



 4. Autonomous Weapons 
 Autonomous weapons—weapons controlled by AI systems rather than human input—already exist and have done for quite some time. Hundreds of tech experts have urged the UN to develop a way to protect humanity from the risks involved in autonomous weapons. 





 Government militaries worldwide already have access to various AI-controlled or semi-AI-controlled weapon systems, like military drones. With facial recognition software, a drone can track an individual. 

 What happens when we start allowing AI algorithms to make life and death decisions without any human input? 

 It’s also possible to customize consumer technology (like drones) to fly autonomously and perform various tasks. This kind of capability in the wrong hands could impact an individual's security on a day-to-day basis. 



 5. Deepfakes, Fake News, and Political Security 
 Image Credit: geralt via Pixabay   

 Facial reconstruction software (more commonly known as deepfake tech) is becoming more and more indistinguishable from reality. 





 The danger of deepfakes is already affecting celebrities and world leaders, and it’s only so long until this trickles down to ordinary people. For instance, scammers are already blackmailing people with deepfake videos created from something as simple and accessible as a Facebook profile picture. 

 And that’s not the only risk. AI can recreate and edit photos, compose text, clone voices, and automatically produce highly targeted advertising. We have already seen how some of these dangers impact society. 



 Mitigating the Risks of Artificial Intelligence 
 As artificial intelligence increases in sophistication and capability, many positive advances are being made. But unfortunately, powerful new technology is always at the risk of being misused. These risks affect almost every facet of our daily lives, from privacy to political security to job automation. 






 The first step in mitigating the risks of artificial intelligence will be to decide where we want AI to be used and where it should be discouraged. Increasing research and debate into AI systems and their uses is the first step to preventing them from being misused.

While this is common knowledge, what many don't understand is that artificial intelligence is more of a concept, and applied artificial intelligence is what puts AI to work in reality. Applied AI leverages the capabilities of software applications and powers machine learning, making it highly accurate and adaptable. It is applied AI that is transforming business processes as well the modern society. .Several benefits like accuracy, cost-saving, and better decision-making come bundled with Applied artificial intelligence. In a dynamic business landscape, these are the benefits applied AI offers to industries. .1. Better Decision Making: A lot of tasks would happen smoothly if machines had human-like judgment capabilities and that is exactly what applied AI brings to the forefront. It ensures reduced errors, predicts close to accurate outcomes, achieves end-to-end process automation, and creates a smart ecosystem. .2. Perfecting Machinery: Applied AI bridges the gap between the digital world and the machine world while reducing errors, social ethics, and human bias in the process. .3. Sharp Efficiency: Throughout all the stages of business processes, Applied AI accelerates efficiency while saving time, effort, and money. .4. Optimized Automation: Applied AI helps in automating mundane and repetitive tasks to free up employees. While computer systems powered by AI handle tedious tasks, employees can devote their time and effort elsewhere to increase the business ROI. .5. Increased Profits: Applied AI boosts profitability by identifying and solving complex business problems, faster than humans, through its machine learning capabilities. .Applications of Applied AI .Applied AI is put to work in various forms, depending on its purpose. These forms include natural language generation, chatbots, speech or image recognition, and sentiment analysis. This technology has become so omnipresent that it has made its place even in the creation of CRM platforms that allow better customer handling and lead to increased customer satisfaction. Industries like marketing use applied AI to target the right advertisement to the right audience, the education industry uses applied AI to decide the right curriculum, law enforcement uses chatbots for threat detection, finance uses applied AI for analyzing trade trends, the manufacturing industry uses applied AI for logistical support, and the healthcare industry uses applied AI for early detection and disease diagnosis, amongst many other uses. .At the rate at which artificial intelligence is advancing, applied AI will see roaring use cases in the future, which is unthinkable at the moment. It is truly one of the most phenomenal and disruptive technologies of our time with immense capabilities to transform the world as we know it. .Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
