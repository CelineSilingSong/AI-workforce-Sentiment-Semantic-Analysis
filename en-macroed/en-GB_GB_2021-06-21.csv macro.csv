Six major Spanish and Spanish-based companies have just launched IndesIA: a national strategic consortium. This project has been established to promote the use of data and AI in Spanish industrial companies with the support of pioneering organisations in the field such as the Basque Artificial Intelligence Centre (BAIC). Around 100 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are already interested in joining IndesIA with the aim of accelerating their digitisation processes, productivity and sustainability in the sector.

IndesIA: a consortium launched by six groups to promote artificial intelligence and data

Telefónica, Repsol, Microsoft, Navantia, Técnicas Reunidas and Gestamp are the six founding members of IndesIA: a consortium for the data economy and artificial intelligence in the industrial sector in Spain that has a European vocation and a desire to integrate other companies and sectors.
IndesIA aims to be a driving project, born with the purpose of positioning Spain as a reference in the use of data and artificial intelligence in the industrial field and to promote the development of a new economy generating economic growth in the country.
This consortium has the support and experience of organisations specialising in artificial intelligence, such as the BAIC, and will also work to try to boost employability, reducing the training gap that exists in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
The consortium’s focus is on several areas of work

In order to achieve its objectives, the tractor project is structured around the following axes:

Create acceleration mechanisms that will streamline the process of developing solutions based on megadata and artificial intelligence, facilitating access to the technical and financial resources needed to implement them.
Generate an ecosystem of start-ups, technology centers and universities specialized in the research and development of artificial intelligence solutions applied to the industrial field that will allow the sharing and application of the most effective knowledge and solutions.
Promote the creation of a large interoperable industrial data platform that favours the development and consumption of artificial intelligence solutions.
Conclude agreements to facilitate access to cutting-edge technologies (IoT, 5G, cloud, supercomputing, quantum, edge computing…) that will enable case development.
Create a school of data and artificial intelligence to be able to involve and train professionals from the industrial sector in the use and analysis of data through appropriate training routes, which also focus on promoting diversity, gender equality and commitment to scientific profiles.

About sixty use cases, the creation of a library of industrial cases and an adapted ecosystem

IndesIA has already identified some sixty use cases based on artificial intelligence that will help drive the value chains of five industrial sectors: engineering, naval, telecommunications, energy and automotive. All the processes in the industrial domain aim to be improved thanks to data and artificial intelligence.
The consortium envisages the generation of a library of transversal and functional industrial cases, duly documented and with access to the data that allowed them to be solved, which will reduce the barriers to entry of artificial intelligence for companies and for more than the hundred SMEs that are already joining the consortium.
To develop these use cases, an ecosystem of companies, start-ups, technology centres and universities specialising in the application of artificial intelligence in the industrial field should be set up soon. This collaborative network will enable the rapid dissemination of the most effective knowledge and practices, as well as their adaptation to the specific needs of each sector.
Several training paths will be defined to cover both the generalized knowledge that employees in the industrial sector need to acquire to better understand how these solutions can help them in their daily lives, as well as specialize in order to retrain new profiles such as data scientists and data engineers internally.

The snipped pieces were lost. Since the 19th century, the trimmed painting has been housed in the Rijksmuseum, where it is displayed as the museum’s centerpiece, at the focal point of its Gallery of Honor.Now, from Wednesday — for the first time in more than three centuries — it will be possible for the public to see the painting “nearly as it was intended,” said the museum’s director, Taco Dibbits.Using new high-tech methods, including scanning technologies and artificial intelligence, the museum has reconstructed those severed parts and hung them next to the original, to give an idea of “The Night Watch” as Rembrandt intended it.ImageThe museum reconstructed the lost pieces by using scanning technology and artificial intelligence.Credit...Ilvy Njiokiktjien for The New York TimesImageThe scans were printed on canvas, attached to metal plates and varnished to look like a painting.Credit...Ilvy Njiokiktjien for The New York TimesImageThe museum’s multimillion-dollar, multiyear restoration project was initiated in 2019. Credit...Ilvy Njiokiktjien for The New York TimesThe cutdown painting is about 15 feet wide by 13 feet high. About two feet from the left of the canvas was shaved off, and another nine inches from the top. Lesser damage was done to the bottom, which lost about five inches, and the right side, which lost three.The Museums Special SectionDark Awakening: Many artists are dimming the lights of their museum shows, for a mix of symbolic and spiritual reasons.A Story Told in 183 Canvases: A 122-foot-long painting by Noah Saterstrom explores mental illness.Striking a Balance: In a biennial between two museums on either side of the U.S.-Mexico border, artists tell fresh stories of their homeland.Exploring History: In North Miami, the Haitian artist Manuel Mathieu weaves the personal and the political.More on Museums: Institutions are striving to offer their visitors more to see, do and feel.Temporarily restoring these parts will give visitors a glimpse of what had been lost: three figures on the left-hand side (two men and a boy) and, more important, a feel for Rembrandt’s meticulous construction in the work’s composition. With the missing pieces, the original dynamism of the masterpiece is stirred back to life.“It gives us an insight into the composition that Rembrandt made,” Dibbits said.Rather than hiring a painter to reconstruct the missing pieces, the museum’s senior scientist, Robert Erdmann, trained a computer to recreate them pixel by pixel in Rembrandt’s style. A project of this complexity was possible thanks to a relatively new technology known as convolutional neural networks, a class of artificial-intelligence algorithms designed to help computers make sense of images, Erdmann said.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT“It’s only recently that we’ve had powerful enough computers to even contemplate something like this,” he said.Image“The Night Watch” has been a national icon in the Netherlands ever since it was painted in 1642.Credit...Ilvy Njiokiktjien for The New York TimesImageHanging the recreated pieces next to the original painting gives an idea of the work as Rembrandt intended it.Credit...Ilvy Njiokiktjien for The New York TimesImage“It’s only recently that we’ve had powerful enough computers to even contemplate something like this,” said the museum’s senior scientist, Robert Erdmann.Credit...Ilvy Njiokiktjien for The New York TimesIndications already existed of how the original “Night Watch” likely looked, thanks to a copy made by Gerrit Lundens, another 17th-century Dutch painter. He made his replica within 12 years of the original, before it was trimmed.Lundens’s copy is less than one-fifth the size of Rembrandt’s monumental canvas, but it is thought to be mostly faithful to the original. It was useful as a model for the missing pieces, even if Lundens’s style was nowhere near as detailed as Rembrandt’s. Lundens’ composition is also much looser, with the figures spread out more haphazardly across the canvas, so it could not be used to make a one-to-one reconstruction.The Rijksmuseum recently made high-resolution scans of Rembrandt’s “Night Watch,” as part of a multimillion-dollar, multiyear restoration project, initiated in 2019. Those scans provided Erdmann with precise information about the details and colors in Rembrandt’s original, which the algorithms used to recreate the missing sections using Lundens’s copy as a guide. The images were then printed on canvas, attached to metal plates for stability and varnished to look like a painting.AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTRembrandt’s composition features a large group of Amsterdam’s civic guards led by Capt. Frans Banninck Cocq and his lieutenant, Willem van Ruytenburch. The original was asymmetrical: The large arch that stands behind the crowd was in the middle, and the group’s leaders were on the right. Rembrandt painted them this way to create a sense of movement through the canvas.ImageFrom Wednesday — for the first time in more than three centuries — the public will see the painting “nearly as it was intended,” said the museum’s director.Credit...Ilvy Njiokiktjien for The New York TimesOnce the new pieces were restored, so was the balance, Dibbits said. “You really get the physical feeling that Banninck Cocq and his colleagues really walk towards you,” he added.Looking at the group of militia men standing just over Banninck Cocq’s shoulder, it is possible to see the top of someone’s head — a hat, a nose and an eye, looking out at the viewer. The figure looks suspiciously like the artist.“That’s so like Rembrandt,” Dibbits said. “To position himself right in the middle.”“It’s part of the process of getting to know the painting in the best way possible,” he added, “as we didn’t know it before.”A version of this article appears in print on June 25, 2021, Section C, Page 14 of the New York edition with the headline: A Trimmed-Down Rembrandt Is Reborn With Help From A.I..

What comes to mind when you think of artificial intelligence?
Maybe you think of an evil cyborg created to kill and destroy? Or maybe a network of vast computers that threatens to steal your job.
Whatever your idea, the truth about artificial intelligence, or “AI” for short, is that it’s far more commonplace than you might imagine, says H.P. Newquist, a computer historian who developed the “Artificial Intelligence: Your Mind & The Machine” exhibit currently at Discovery Place Science.
“The reality is, we already have AI all around us,” he said. “We have it in our cell phones with Siri and Alexa. We have it in our homes and Google GPS maps.” 
Every time you buy a product on Amazon or watch a show on Netflix, AI is watching.
The exhibit, Newquist said, is meant to make artificial intelligence “real and relevant” to more people.
Here are five things we learned while touring the exhibit:
#1. Women led the way
In an industry dominated by men, women have played a central role in the development of AI.
From Mary Shell, the 19th-century author who wrote the book “Frankenstein,” right up to this current day, women have envisioned machines that could “think” like humans…or at least appear to anyway.


You’ll learn about Fei-Fei Li, a Chinese-born scientist who was an early pioneer of artificial intelligence.
Fun fact: A woman named Ada Lovelace is considered by some to be the world’s first computer programmer…way back in the 1800s.
#2. AI looks for patterns
You know those cat pictures we love to hate on the internet? This exhibition tells you how they helped in the development of artificial intelligence. 
That technology has now given way to facial-recognition software, which allows you to unlock your phone simply by looking at the screen. 


Check out the photo above.
Can you tell which squares contain Chihuahuas and which show blueberry muffins? Can artificial intelligence tell the difference? The Discovery Place exhibit provides some surprising answers.
#3. Race matters with AI 
Cameras loaded with facial-recognition software are everywhere in China, and video footage in the Discovery Place exhibit takes you there.
But here in the U.S., many police departments use that same technology to locate suspects.



Because so much is at stake, Newquist said, the tech companies that are developing new generations of AI must do more to recruit and train people of color, lest (even more) racial bias gets built into the systems.
The exhibit will help you see other reasons why that’s important. 
#4. Yes, AI may steal your job
Imagine the amount of artificial intelligence it takes to produce a self-driving car.



Someday that same technology may replace hundreds of thousands of long-haul truckers and other commercial drivers. And when that day arrives, Newquist said, countless other jobs that depend on human drivers also will be lost.
Is your job vulnerable to artificial intelligence? 
The exhibit offers some clues.
#5. It’s complicated
When asked whether society is better off with or without artificial intelligence, Newquist was quick with his response.
“With it,” he said. 


Despite the challenges, artificial intelligence has made our lives better and safer, eliminating mundane tasks and freeing up more of our time for productive (and fun) activities, he said.
“It ultimately only takes a wrong turn when the wrong people use it,” he said.
Visit Discovery Place Science in Uptown to see for yourself.
The AI exhibit will be there through August 22. To keep visitors safe and socially distanced, reservations are required.

Lost Edges of Rembrandt’s ‘Night Watch’ Are Restored Using Artificial Intelligence
Experts have used new technology to recreate missing portions of the old master painting

In 1642, Rembrandt van Rijn completed a dynamic painting called The Night Watch, which depicts the captain of an Amsterdam city militia urging his men into battle. But in 1715 someone cut all four sides of the canvas to hang it on a wall in Amsterdam’s Town Hall, and the strips seemingly vanished into thin air.
Now, researchers have restored the work to its original size using A.I. As Mike Corder reports for the Associated Press (AP), experts used a combination of scanners, X-rays and 528 digital exposures to recreate and print the missing portions of the canvas during “Operation Night Watch,” a multi-million dollar restoration effort that began in 2019. Today, the newly created shreds are affixed to the edges of the painting, which is currently hanging in Rijksmuseum’s honor gallery in Amsterdam.

“We made an incredibly detailed photo of the Night Watch and through artificial intelligence or what they call a neural network, we taught the computer what color Rembrandt used in the Night Watch, which colors, what his brush strokes looked like,” the museum's director Taco Dibbits tells the AP.
The resized painting measures about 15- by 13-feet. In total, someone removed almost two feet from the left of the canvas and another nine inches from the top. The bottom only lost about five inches of fabric, and the right side is missing around three, notes Nina Siegal in the New York Times.
“I am always hoping that somebody will call up one day to say that they have the missing pieces,” Dibbits tells the Guardian’s Daniel Boffey. “I can understand that the bottom part and top might not be saved but on the left hand you have three figures, so it is surprising that they didn’t surface because at the time in 1715 Rembrandt was already much appreciated and an expensive artist.”
However, museum employees haven’t been able to locate the fragments yet, so they had to get creative. Though many museums employ painters to reconstruct master works, the Rijksmuseum decided to use new restoration methods, and its senior scientist Robert Erdmann was able to use a computer to recreate the missing panels stroke by stroke, per the Times.
Erdmann and his team were ultimately able to complete the task thanks to a new technology called Convolutional Neural Networks—a type of artificial intelligence algorithm that helps computers figure out what images may have once looked like.
Experts also used Dutch painter Gerrit Lunden’s 17th-century copy of the painting to determine what the panels should look like. Lunden created his replica around 12 years after Rembrandt completed the original copy. The replica is about one-fifth of the original canvas’ size, and Lunden didn't paint as meticulously as Rembrandt did, but experts believe that the composition of the copy mimics the original one.
“It’s only recently that we’ve had powerful enough computers to even contemplate something like this,” Erdmann tells the Times.
Born in the Netherlands in 1606, Rembrandt was one of the most well-respected Baroque painters. According to Encyclopedia Britannica, the artist started painting at a young age after he left traditional schooling to train as a painter. Later in his career, Rembrandt created a series of technically accomplished self-portraits and complex narrative scenes like The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp (1632).
Rembrandt’s Night Watch is one of the artist’s most famous works and portrays its main subjects, Captain Frans Banninck Cocq and Lieutenant Willem van Ruytenburch, in the center of the composition.
Museum employees hope that the new restoration job will help onlookers see Rembrandt’s master work in a way that more closely resembles its original form.
“Rembrandt would have definitely done it more beautifully, but this comes very close,” Dibbits tells the AP.

Law enforcement officers have also started utilising Artificial Intelligence in solving crimes— from petty to horrendous. The machine learning models, help the police department to guide through each step without wasting too much time on any wrong process to capture criminals. It boosts productivity to help victims get justice as soon as possible. Jurors consider multiple pieces of evidence captured by Artificial Intelligence to decide the severity of the punishments. Thus, there is a significant rise in crime prevention and detection after using Artificial Intelligence in solving crimes..Cities are getting smarter with the continuous installation of hi-tech CCTVs and buying smart devices. Artificial Intelligence models work on the real-time information that comes from these CCTVs and records from smart devices. Whenever police officers need to track criminals down, they prefer to use AI like a smart assistant to monitor the movements precisely. The facial recognition system helps in understanding the last location of any victim as well as detecting the behaviour of the criminal or abductor..AI also helps to detect gunfire shots with sensors connected to a cloud-based application. It does not need any passer-by to call the police and inform them about the gunfire. The multiple sensors capture the time and sound of gunfire shots and send real-time data to the police department for determining the current position of the shooter..Artificial Intelligence, is solving crimes by detecting essential and hidden clues from multiple crime scenes that are impossible to detect with the naked human eye. It opens a plethora of connections to new links from the evidence from photographs. The new links are worth checking out because it reduces the time to solve the crime and get hold of the criminal involved..The appropriate use of Artificial Intelligence in solving crimes, helps the law enforcement officers in crime prevention and detection efficiently.

Artificial Intelligence in action

                                                                    By Special Reports

Spiwe Chireka, telecoms, media and technology expert  
AI has the potential to deliver real value in business, creating unprecedented efficiencies across countless processes. But is South Africa’s industry ready? 
In the 1964 children’s novel by British author Roald Dahl Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Charlie’s dad, Mr Bucket, loses his job when the factory where he works is mechanised. Once responsible for screwing the lids onto tubes of toothpaste, he gets laid off because a robot is able to perform his job more cheaply and efficiently. 
This trope of man being replaced by machine often comes up in discussions about artificial intelligence (AI) and its potential impact on our world and workforce. But the fear around how emerging technologies will challenge our existing culture and change our lives fails to acknowledge the many benefits that accompany the growth of innovations such as AI. And these gains span all industries, not only computing and IT. 
In 2021, Forrester Research predicted that more and more companies will implement AI for no other reason than because they have to do so if they want to compete in an AI-driven future. 2020 gave business leaders the impetus, born out of necessity, to embrace technologies that make them future-proof and digital-ready, the research firm notes, predicting that the AI software market will grow to $37-billion globally by 2025.
“I would go as far as to say that AI is at the heart of Industry 4.0 and/or the fourth industrial revolution,” says Spiwe Chireka, telecoms, media and technology industry expert. “It is one of those technological advancements that adds the ‘oomph’ to other technology advancements.”
New technology, new ways of working
AI has expanded the bounds of possibility, especially when it comes to data, explains Ndabenhle Ngulube, one of the cofounders of Pineapple, a local insurtech start-up: “Once upon a time, something like time-to-purchase data was seen as futile and meaningless. But today, this kind of data is the de facto input for thousands of AI models around the world.” Why? Because some customers will make a purchase on their first visit to your website, while others will only purchase a product after their second, third or fourth visit. If you understand how long it takes customers to buy something, you have a better understanding of their behaviour and you’re better equipped to tailor your marketing campaigns to offer a more personalised experience.

The insurance industry has historically been guilty of sitting on massive amounts of data, with no application for it. Not only is artificial intelligence changing this narrative, it’s also making the process of taking out insurance faster and easier, Ngulube says. For example, the Pineapple app allows a user to get cover by simply snapping an image of the item they want to insure. The app’s computer vision AI recognises what the image is and then places that image in an appropriate category for pricing purposes before providing the customer with an estimated premium.
Today, every business owner needs to understand how AI can be leveraged across their operations and how it is relevant to their progress and sustainability, says Volente Morais, executive manager at Koogan Plastics, a South African plastics and packaging manufacturer. What do these applications and technologies look like for a business like mine, where production is heavily reliant on people, she asks? Well, they’ve incorporated a smart robot into their labelling assembly line. This AI timed system is trained to respond to the exact location of the product so that it can mould labels directly onto the product instead of sticking on an adhesive label. “The value gained here is efficiency, process improvement and reduction in waste costs. And our increased output ultimately improves our revenue,” she states, noting that innovations like this are game changers in sectors where everyone is selling the same product. But with the introduction of new technologies comes an evolution of the workforce and growth in the sizable skills gaps that already exist. 
According to Professor Duncan Coulter, deputy head of the Academy of Computer Science and Software Engineering at The University of Johannesburg (UJ), as intelligent systems become more ubiquitous, there is a great need to educate non-specialists in both the use and limitations of these emerging technologies. For those looking to up their AI expertise, UJ has added an AI specialisation option to their existing BSc honours in Computer Science and Informatics. They have also introduced an undergraduate BSc (Computer Science) with an AI specialisation, which includes an AI-focused project module in the final year. In addition to this, the Academy of Computer Science and Software Engineering offers a short learning programme focused on the creation of intelligent systems using modern techniques and technologies.  
“If you talk about artificial intelligence as the pursuit of creating genuine, generalised intelligence, we are quite far from realising that goal. If you consider artificial intelligence as being our capacity to embed pre-existing intelligent behaviours into artefacts, then we have made considerable progress,” concludes Coulter. “But even fairly simple tools can be used for great good and for great harm; just as a hammer could serve as a tool for construction or a weapon of destruction. For this reason, there is increasing work that needs to be done to maximise the gains that can be made in terms of the tasks these systems are good at, while minimising the harm that can be done through these very same tasks.” — Joanne Carew
AI and legal liabilityBack in 2018, a self-driving Volvo knocked down and killed a pedestrian in Arizona. This was the first pedestrian fatality involving an autonomous car. Who was responsible? AI law refers to the application of the law on AI. Like any branch of law, it has to evolve in order to deal with new challenges and new situations such as this one, notes Patrick Bracher, a director at Norton Rose Fulbright. The increased use of AI demands that existing legal principles be adapted to account for new ways of life and new ways of doing business, and modern precedents will have to be established to determine who is responsible should death, injury or damage be caused by the failure of an AI system.
AI gone wrong Part science, part art, we need to remember that Artificial Intelligence is only as smart as the data it’s fed, which is why AI systems sometimes get things wrong. Back in 2016, a Microsoft Twitter chatbot spewed out misogynistic and racist remarks after learning these sentiments from users. Around the same time, an Amazon recruitment tool came under fire for disadvantaging female candidates because it was based on historical hiring decisions, which traditionally favoured men over women. This is why diversity is so important — diversity in the people developing the AI systems and in the data being used to power them.

In the digital world, artificial intelligence is already capable of doing several things that humans can do. The technology can help robots draw your picture amazingly, write a poem for you, click pictures, do house chores, etc. In a nutshell, artificial intelligence is turning to be humans in the 21st century. However, all is not working out in its favor. If we look closely at AI technology, we can see there are some things that artificial intelligence can't do..Humans started working on technology with the thought to make something as capable as him/them. Although we are not in a full-fledged situation to enjoy such luxury, today, artificial intelligence can do a lot of tasks that humans dreamed of. Moving on to the future, AI researchers predict a period when robots could walk, talk, and have perfect human qualities. Even now, half of them are already happening and some are in progress. However, we don't know if we are awaiting a future where humans and machines work together or robots bring an apocalypse to take over human society. There is no doubt we have had many ground-breaking advancements in machine learning, cloud computing, robotics, quantum computing, etc. Unfortunately, artificial intelligence just isn't there yet. There are many things, that artificial intelligence can't do for humankind or society. In a world filled with AI punditry and hysterical fearmongering, separating artificial intelligence from fiction can be a tough task indeed. That is why Analytics Insight has phrased out some things that artificial intelligence can't do despite its increasing dominance and unconditional development..HOW ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WILL AFFECT THE FUTURE OF WORK AND LIFE?5 TYPES OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THAT WILL SHAPE 2021 AND BEYONDAFTER YEARS OF ADVANCEMENT, WHAT ARE THE THINGS AI CANNOT DO YET?.Use 'Common sense' to Make Decisions in Real-time.A major aspect where artificial intelligence falls behind humans is in using common sense. Although robots are capable of doing what man is incapable of, such as labor intense jobs and working in dangerous circumstances, artificial intelligence is still no competition to humans' intellect. Machines can even make wise decisions and help humans make the right choice, but when things get twisted, robots entangle in confusion. For example, if we say 'A woman went shopping. She bought a beautiful dress. She left the place with a big smile.' If asked what the woman shopped, a human would instantly say 'a beautiful dress.' But answering these simple questions is very difficult for artificial intelligence..Humans can automatically grasp the concept in real-time, but machines are not wise enough to use their common sense and answer in such situations. Besides, humans have lived through times. So, we know what is necessary for a circumstance and what is not. But machines are just fed with data that were run on humans, which can be complicated. Robots can't get things straight through those datasets and acting to situations in real-time is real trouble for artificial intelligence..Care for Human Beings.Humans are gifted with a sixth sense that makes us different from other living beings. However, despite the improvements that AI researchers have made, robots are still incapable of caring for humans or fellow robots and machines. For example, the Australian government uses a chatbot called 'Nadia' to help people access the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Although Nadia can interpret their speech and expressions with 85% accuracy, she can't abstract the emotions they carry. With zero emotional intelligence, Nadia just looks at their sad face and carries out the process. Therefore, all the responses by Nadia are rational from a perspective. Whether the caller yells or cries or talks sweetly, her response would be similar to all of them..This is where robots highly differ from humans. Even AI researchers agree that people will never forget how you made them feel in a critical situation and today's artificial intelligence can't compete with reality on that scale..Do Multiple Tasks at the Same Time.We must've come across the ideology that women are capable of doing multiple tasks at the same time very well. When men are already incapable of doing the same at women's level, machines are nothing. AI researchers have trained robots to solve specific problems. But the ability to perform different tasks at a time is still in progress. Recently, Google tried its hand at making robots do multiple tasks. It implied its Google Assistant to do the routines. But the result was not very positive. Although artificial intelligence was capable of doing a number of things, it only played a selective role after receiving a command. So it is safe to say that today's robots can't take notes from a business chart, attend a phone call and answer the queries, and arrange things for the upcoming meeting, all at the same time..Replace a Good Employee.Forget the dystopian future, humans are just scared of the fact that robots might take over their jobs very soon. Although this could be a reality to some extent, it is not a complete truth. Take the robots in healthcare for example. They take medicines to patients, follow their timeline, and even perform surgeries. But what they lack is the empathy to comfort people. But an actual human doctor can do that. Besides, machines can't take the initiative and proactively look for areas of improvement. Human employees develop processes and train others to make the company work more effectively and efficiently. Even though machines can take over laborious jobs, they will only push humans to carry out intellectual works without wiping out their job opportunities..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.

But today it is intensively about software tools and computer designs. The demand for artificial intelligence and digital technology has been gaining momentum. Advancements in the AI sector are transforming smart systems and supervised machine learning to a great extent..Artificial intelligence systems will ease the laborious tasks that engineers do such as finding relevant content, fixing errors, and determining solutions. Smart systems can help finish their job quickly. AI and digital tech can also assist the system engineer in creating sophisticated designs along with incorporating sensor-based design procedures and delivering the designs to intelligent manufacturing facilities..But AI may not approach the project the way a human designer would. Sometimes this can go off the grid too. Because today's machines are usually made of expert systems that have software-enabled decision-making. Since the engine of this software is based on if-then rules, it is acquired through experience..When new knowledge is registered in the library, the software uses if-then rules to expand new facts or ifs and comes out suggesting various solutions or then what occurs..This process serves as the basis of AI and machine learning. As people are connected with the help of the internet, this opens the doors for smart machines to bring in new services and opportunities..The largest fraction of smart systems is currently made of expert systems and this will be soon taken over by autonomous robots through technology transformation by 2024. There are critics as well as supporters for this trend. Since the number of robotic appliances continues to increase automatically, the cost of the sensors will decrease this becomes the simple reason for artificial intelligence robots to multiply within no time..The robotic sensors market is estimated to undergo a CAGR of nearly 8% over the forecast period of (2021-2026). Currently, most of the industries like automotive, transportation, industrial manufacturing, logistics, and defense have started to adopt autonomous robotics and digital technology as their main mode of the production process..As a result, due to this rapid growth of smart technologies with its roots, interconnected artificial intelligence can lead to uncertainty. Though computers can take intelligently-based action, they are not capable of replicating the cognition processes of the human brain. Algorithms of artificial intelligence tech can only deal with known data and cannot predict and formulate rational decisions during uncertain situations..New technologies using the most advanced AI and machine learning have been coming up due to their widespread connectivity and inexpensive sensors. These technologies are primitive and still are not capable of mimicking the human brain..It becomes clear that AI algorithms relate facts to solutions that are dependent on experiential learning without any acknowledgment of physics. AI has evolved from scientific advancement to an engineering tool. Latest innovations in digital tech require engineers from various domains to learn and integrate AI tools into their engineering designs..Many open-source tools such as Microsoft's DMLT, Google's TensorFlow, and Amazon's DSSTNE possess software libraries that empower machine learning. The DeepVariant open AI software of Google can depict a person's genome from sequencing data more accurately than other methods are helping engineers to seek help from..Personal productivity assistants like Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, and Windows Cortana use natural language processing to make decisions. IBM Watson has been trained by Oncologists to help them treat and diagnose lung cancer. Tesla is getting closer to self-driving autonomous vehicles. Zebra Medical Systems, an Israeli company is developing tools for radiology having greater than human accuracy. All this is possible with the help of different types of engineers who are responsible for training smart systems..At this point in time, the role of a human engineer may be that of a director shortly rather than producing and manufacturing the products. Though humans may not be executing the task, they are definitely the ones who are choosing the direction the machine should work. Once the machine knows how to design things, the system of engineering will change but engineers will still be highly skilled and relevant..The uncertain future of technologies demands resilient and versatile engineers who can design robust technologies using artificial intelligence with different skill sets, including teaching AI systems how to innovate and become part of future human-AI organizations..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
