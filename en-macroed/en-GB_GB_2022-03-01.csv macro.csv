A World Without Work
By Daniel Susskind
For centuries, people have worried that new technologies—from the mechanical loom to the internal combustion engine—would replace human labor and render us superfluous. And for centuries, these fears have proven misplaced as new technologies have increased our productivity and created new jobs.
In A World Without Work, Susskind convincingly makes the case that this time truly is different—that in the coming decades, artificial intelligence will put broad swaths of the human population out of work.

What will it mean for society as more and more of the jobs that underpin our economy are automated? What steps can we take to mitigate the worst side effects of this transition? And most profoundly: how will we use our time, measure our lives and find purpose in a world in which people no longer need to work?

These questions are among the most important of our era. There are no easy answers. But this book does an excellent job of framing the issues.

Genius Makers
By Cade Metz
Genius Makers is the enthralling, entertaining story of how the modern field of artificial intelligence came to be. Informed by hundreds of exclusive interviews, the book is brimming with colorful anecdotes and behind-the-scenes details about the birth of deep learning. It focuses above all on the characters who ushered in today’s AI revolution: Geoff Hinton, Demis Hassabis, Yann LeCun, Fei-Fei Li, Jeff Dean and more.
For anyone interested in the field of artificial intelligence and its roots, this book is essential reading.

What Computers Still Can’t Do
By Hubert Dreyfus
Originally published in 1972 and then updated in 1992, this classic text argues from first principles that digital computers may never be able to fully replicate higher mental functions. Thoughtfully fusing philosophy, history, psychology and engineering, the book’s skeptical perspective cannot easily be dismissed.
Perhaps the most remarkable thing about this book is that, though it was written decades ago, it remains remarkably on point to this day. Consider, for instance, its critique of (what we now know as) supervised learning: “It is really the person deciding which cases are good examples who is furnishing the intelligence. Viewed from this perspective, neural networks are almost as dependent upon human intelligence as are GOFAI [good old-fashioned artificial intelligence] systems.”

The Alignment Problem
By Brian Christian
Artificial intelligence is being entrusted with more and more real-world responsibility: in our financial systems, our hospitals, our schools, our homes. As we develop increasingly complex AI systems whose decision-making we don’t directly control or even understand, how can we ensure that these systems’ judgment and values are aligned with our own?
This book provides an illuminating examination of what is known as the “alignment problem” in AI, from its technical foundations to its philosophical implications. Particularly fascinating is the book’s discussion of inverse reinforcement learning and the promise this approach holds for building AI systems we can trust.
As Christian notes, the alignment problem bears a real resemblance to parenting: “The story of human civilization has always been about how to instill values in strange, alien, human-level intelligences who will inevitably inherit the reins of society from us—namely, our kids.”

Klara and the Sun
By Kazuo Ishiguro
Klara and the Sun, the most recent novel from Nobel Prize-winning author Kazuo Ishiguro, is the only work of fiction on our list.
Fiction is sometimes a more powerful medium than nonfiction to surface and explore complex societal issues, including the disorienting transformations wrought by new technologies. Klara and the Sun is a case in point. The relationships between the story’s artificially intelligent characters and its human ones prompt readers to think afresh about family, mortality, and the meaning of life. The scenarios and dilemmas in this story are fictional—but within our lifetimes they may become all too real.

Rebooting AI
By Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis
Gary Marcus is a polarizing figure in the world of AI. He is one of the most vocal and persistent critics of today’s prevailing AI paradigm centered on big data and deep learning. He frequently calls out deep learning’s lack of robustness and common sense, arguing that the path forward in AI must include the incorporation of traditional symbolic methods.
Whether one agrees or disagrees with Marcus, he is worth taking seriously. (After all, remember that Geoff Hinton and his deep learning peers were themselves in the dissenting minority for decades.)
Rebooting AI is a nice encapsulation of Marcus’ main arguments about the state of AI today. It is worth a read. In the words of John Stuart Mill: “He who knows only his own side of the case knows little of that.”

Four Futures
By Peter Frase
This brief, imaginative, little-known work is a fascinating read, especially for those who like to think about the big picture—the really big picture.
Four Futures begins with the premise that three key forces will shape human life and civilization in the twenty-first century: automation, climate change, and sociopolitical inequality. The book sketches out four alternative visions for how these forces will interact to transform society in the decades ahead. Some of these potential futures are distressingly bleak, while others are more hopeful.
The book calls attention to two crucial points about artificial intelligence and society. First, whether one is optimistic or pessimistic about AI’s long-term impact, there is little question that it will be transformative—so we should all be engaging. And second, nothing is preordained: the choices that humanity makes and the values that we prioritize in the years ahead will determine how this technology transforms our world.

Less than a quarter (22 per cent) of firms that have introduced AI technology over the last five years say that it has led to a net loss of jobs, according to a recently published study by the University of Warwick’s Institute of Employment Research and the University of Sussex Business School.Academics collected data from 759 respondents via a YouGov panel in 2018, and found that 22 per cent of firms that introduced AI had seen net job destruction, where the number of jobs lost is higher than the number created. It found that AI technology is more likely to be disruptive to job numbers than other non-AI based technology: 4 per cent of respondents that had introduced other forms of technology in their organisation saw net job destruction, while 9 per cent of those organisations saw net job creation.The study, which compiled data from business leaders in organisations with more than 10 employees across the private, public and third sectors, found that AI is 28 percentage points more likely to be linked with job creation than other forms of technology, but also 26 percentage points more likely to be associated with job destruction than other technologies.It also found that of the 81 per cent of respondents who had introduced a form of new technology over the past five years (up to 2018), a quarter (25 per cent) had introduced AI-enabled technology; 69 per cent had introduced new IT hardware; and 59 per cent had introduced new online networking platforms. Dr Wil Hunt, research fellow at the Institute of Employment Research, said the study points to the need to focus on AI’s potential for job creation through labour saving and improved productivity levels: “Future research would do well to pay heed to specific applications of AI and the motivations behind adoption as well as the scale of job creation and destruction effects.”

Graham Carter
How did Earth turn from a sterile ball of rock into a lush, green world of living things? This question of how life got started is one of the hardest of them all.
Still, we are inching closer to answering it. Several scientists have created things that approximate to life. Late last year, a team led by Josh Bongard at the University of Vermont reprogrammed frog skin cells into “xenobots“. These groups of cells can swim and reproduce, working together to corral loose cells into new versions of themselves.
But if you drill right down to the heart of this question, you reach a bedrock of chemistry. How did a selection of inanimate molecules start joining together and replicating themselves? In the 1950s, chemists Stanley Miller and Harold Urey put a mixture of chemicals in a sealed jar and showed that amino acids, a key ingredient in living things, could be formed spontaneously. That was a big step, but it still doesn’t tell us how those molecules formed a self-replicating system.
This is why chemists are interested in trying to recreate the moment that inanimate chemistry turned into the simplest possible life. There are billions of ways this could have happened. So Lee Cronin at the University of Glasgow, UK, is employing robots to help investigate. He and his team have set up machines that combine a selection of simple substances – acids, inorganic minerals, carbon-based molecules – to react randomly. The outcome is analysed and then an algorithm helps the robot choose how to proceed. In this way, the robot can hunt through vast swathes of…

The Review Board of the United States Copyright Office recently confirmed on appeal that copyright does not subsist in a work created by an AI in the United States.1 The decision of the Review Board makes it clear that human authorship is a prerequisite for copyright protection in the United States.
This reflects an ongoing trend in IP law, with IP Offices around the world faced with the question of whether protections can be provided for the product of an AI.
The New Zealand position on copyright protection for machine-generated works is in stark contrast to the US position. The New Zealand Copyright Act 1994 expressly provides that they can be protected by copyright.
Background
Steven Thaler has recently gained some notoriety in IP circles for being the first person to seek patent protection for an AI-generated invention. Mr Thaler’s patent applications, filed in several countries, identify an AI system (called DABUS which stands for “Device for the Autonomous Bootstrapping of Unified Sentience”) as the inventor on his patent applications. He has had varying degrees of success so far. He has failed in the United States, the United Kingdom and New Zealand (among other countries) but succeeded in Australia. Appeals are pending in all those jurisdictions.
In November 2018, Mr Thaler filed an application with the US Copyright Office to register a copyright claim in a two-dimensional artwork called ‘A Recent Entrance to Paradise’ – shown below:

 









In the application, Mr Thaler identified the author of the work as the “Creativity Machine”, an AI system he devised and owns.
Mr Thaler further stated in his application that the work had been “autonomously created by a computer algorithm running on a machine” and that he was “seeking to register this computer-generated work as a work-for-hire to the owner of the Creativity Machine”.2
The US Copyright Office’s decisions
The US Copyright Office initially rejected the application in 2019 because it “lack[ed] the human authorship necessary to support a copyright claim”. Mr Thaler subsequently requested that the Copyright Office reconsider its initial refusal arguing that “the human authorship requirement is unconstitutional and unsupported by either statute or case law”.
The Copyright Office reviewed the case but in 2020 upheld its initial findings, determining that the work “lack[ed] the required human authorship necessary to sustain a claim in copyright,” because Mr Thaler had “provided no evidence on sufficient creative input or intervention by a human author in the work”.
Mr Thaler filed a second request for reconsideration, renewing his argument that the human authorship requirement is unconstitutional and unsupported by case law.
The Review Board of the US Copyright Office again dismissed Mr Thaler’s arguments on the same grounds. It held that US Courts interpreting the Copyright Act, including the Supreme Court, have uniformly limited copyright protection to creations of human authors.3
The position under the New Zealand Copyright Act 1994
The position in the United States is in direct contrast to the position under the Copyright Act 1994 in New Zealand (the Act) where machine-generated works are protected by copyright for 50 years. Also, unlike in the United States, copyright cannot be registered in New Zealand. It subsists automatically upon creation of a copyright work, without further formalities. 
Section 5(2)(a) of the Act expressly provides that the author of a work, being the person who creates it, can be “in the case of a literary, dramatic, musical, or artistic work that is computer-generated, the person by whom the arrangements necessary for the creation of the work are undertaken; in this case Mr Thaler.
The term “computer-generated” is itself defined (at section 2) as “work [that] is generated by computer in circumstances such that there is no human author of the work”.
Computer-generated works had become relatively common from the 1980s, such as weather maps and telephone directories. However, Parliament clearly did not have AI in mind when almost 20 years ago it adopted, word for word, those provisions from the UK Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988.
Still, the Act makes it expressly clear that ‘non-human works’ can be protected by copyright.
Conclusion
Under sections 18(2)(a) and 230 of the Act, the Creativity Machine’s ‘A Recent Entrance to Paradise’ is protected by copyright in New Zealand because Mr Thaler, as a US citizen benefits from the copyright protection afforded by the Act. Also, Mr Thaler, as the person who devised and used the Creativity Machine, owns that copyright.
New Zealand is one of only a handful of countries whose laws afford copyright protection to computer-generated works.
However, a review of the Copyright Act 1994 is underway. As part of that, the government has sought submissions on AI and copyright; it asked “whether any problems are created by the current rules relating to computer-generated works, including in light of new technological developments such as artificial intelligence”.4 The submissions received in response suggest most submitters consider the current approach appropriate.5
Many believe AI is the future. One side of the argument is that protecting the creative output of AI by copyright, giving the owner of that copyright exclusive rights to exploit the work for 50 years, will lead to increased use of AI. The counterargument is that copyright is about rewarding an author’s efforts and exercise of judgment and skills and stopping others from misappropriating those such that there is little point protecting a work that took no human effort to create.
The Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment has not made a timeline available for next steps in its review of the Copyright Act. It intends to seek further feedback on objectives through its next public consultation. Time will tell whether this unusual facet of the Copyright Act will give New Zealand’s creative and high-tech sectors a competitive edge in this fast-developing field.

2 In other words, Mr Thaler argued he commissioned the Creativity Machine to create the work (like an independent contractor) such that, as the commissioning party, he should own copyright in the work.
3 In its decision, the US Copyright Office refers to several court decisions holding that copyright does not protect works created by, or alleged to have been created by non-humans such as: ‘non-human spiritual beings’, a monkey, a living garden, the Holy Spirit.

Cedars-Sinai Establishes New Division: Artificial  Intelligence in Medicine
New Artificial Intelligence in Medicine Unit Uses Data to Find New Solutions to Complex, Modern Healthcare Needs

What is Ai? The Department of Medicine at Cedars-Sinai has established a new division to explore how artificial intelligence (Ai) can be applied to help solve complex medical problems and enhance clinical care.The new division, Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, or AIM, is led by Sumeet Chugh, MD, an associate director of the Smidt Heart Institute and a prominent expert in sudden cardiac arrest, who has long relied on technology and population-wide data to help demystify who might be susceptible to the usually fatal heart rhythm disturbance.“Through the use of applied artificial intelligence, we can solve existing gaps in mechanisms, diagnostics and therapeutics of major human disease conditions which afflict large populations,” said Paul Noble, MD, professor of Medicine and Chair of the Department of Medicine, who created  the new division. “The future of medicine lies in decoding enormous amounts of phenotypic and genotypic patient data.”In conjunction with AIM, Cedars-Sinai has developed several key programs in which artificial intelligence is being increasingly deployed. Jason H. Moore, PhD, was recently named founding chair of the newly created Department of Computational Biomedicine—a systemwide program committed to advancing medical discoveries through interfacing the data sciences with clinical information.Furthermore, Cedars-Sinai’s Enterprise Data Intelligence team, led by Mike Thompson, has a substantial track record of using AI tools to facilitate patient care at the hospital level–a particularly valuable resource that enabled outstanding care during the pandemic.“Dr. Chugh has extensive experience using artificial intelligence to solve clinical problems for sudden cardiac arrest, one of our most difficult conditions,” said Shlomo Melmed, MB, ChB, executive vice president of Academic Affairs and dean of the Medical Faculty at Cedars-Sinai. “Under his leadership, the new division will harness the Cedars-Sinai systemwide clinical data warehouse to design clinically relevant approaches to solving important health questions.”Chugh said AIM has a multidisciplinary mandate. With its current focus on cardiac imaging, sudden cardiac arrest, COVID-19 and clinical genetics, Chugh hopes that division members will tackle a broad range of medical, surgical and public health problems.“Using a disease-based approach, AIM will enable cross-disciplinary connections between clinicians, scientists, and trainees at Cedars-Sinai at multiple levels,” said Chugh.Artificial Intelligence in ActionIn practice, AIM recently published a study in the Journal of Nuclear Medicine, employing artificial intelligence algorithms to identify heart attack risk in patients with already established coronary artery disease.  “Because the actual risk for recurring heart attacks differs greatly among patients, predicting future risk in patients with existing coronary artery disease can be challenging,” said Piotr Slomka, PhD, professor of medicine in the Division of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, and lead author of the study. “Predicting risk, however, becomes easier and more efficient with the use of artificial intelligence.”New research, from the division of AIM, was also recently published in the journal JAMA Cardiology. In the study, physician-scientists created an artificial intelligence tool that can effectively identify and distinguish between two life-threatening heart conditions that are often easy to miss: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and cardiac amyloidosis.“These two heart conditions are challenging for even expert cardiologists to accurately identify, and so patients often go on for years to decades before receiving a correct diagnosis,” said David Ouyang, MD, a cardiologist in the Smidt Heart Institute, member of the division of AIM, and senior author of the study. “Our AI algorithm can pinpoint disease patterns that can’t be seen by the naked eye, and then use these patterns to predict the right diagnosis.”As the new division advances, Chugh and team are designing clinically relevant questions from the broader Cedars-Sinai Health System that can be ethically vetted, analyzed, validated, and implemented.  “We hope to function as innovators and custodians of patients’ healthcare interests and needs,” said Chugh, the Pauline and Harold Price Chair in Cardiac Electrophysiology Research. “And, most important, we are bringing discoveries directly to patient care.”Read more from the Cedars-Sinai Blog: Graduate Students Are Using Ai in Medical Imaging

In collaboration with the UAE Artificial Intelligence Office, the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) has launched an artificial intelligence (AI) and coding licence.
The licence, which is a UAE first, will support the country’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 2031.
The DIFC Innovation Hub, which is the region’s largest cluster of fintech and innovation enterprises, will provide a stimulating environment for companies holding the licence. The Hub hosts over 500 firms, ranging from startups to global unicorns, representing over 60 per cent of GCC fintechs.
The licence provides an opportunity to obtain the UAE Golden Visas for employees working in those companies.

 
Omar Sultan Al Olama, Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence, Digital Economy and Remote Work Applications, commented, “Such initiatives reflect positively on the country’s readiness to become a global destination for pioneering the future industries by adopting advanced technology stimulating innovation in various fields. The UAE Government is keen to support digital transformation processes that embody of the directives Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai.”
“This is being achieved by developing digital activities and providing innovative solutions that improve governments’ performance and the lives of communities. DIFC has opened new horizons for leading global companies that aspire to enhance their efforts in AI and expand their businesses further.”
Essa Kazim, governor of DIFC, said, “Dubai and DIFC are global ambassadors for AI. Financial Services companies in DIFC and a broad spectrum of other industries across the emirate are setting the standard that contributes to the UAE’s ambitious goal to have an internationally competitive, knowledge-based economy.”
Coding is a game-changer, and currently, it is recognised as a necessary skill and a competitive advantage for a wide range of professional roles. Undoubtedly one of the most important talents to master for current and future generations, coding and programming help young students develop problem-solving abilities, such as solving an issue rationally and creatively.
The UAE has launched initiatives under the ‘Project of the 50’ aiming to attract 100 of the world’s best coders to the country – every day.
Meanwhile earlier this year, the UAE government also launched the Coders HQ, a new transformational project that re-defines local coding communities, in partnership with more than 40 companies in the UAE and around the world.

The project, established in the Emirates Towers, aims to build a new generation of coders, enhance their capabilities and skills in coding and technology, empower them with tools and expertise, and provide them with the opportunity to design innovative solutions to address local and global challenges.

Artificial intelligence predicts algae potential as alternative energy source
Jet fuel, animal feed among potential products from algae

March 4, 2022 - by Blair Fannin





Texas A&M AgriLife Research scientists are using artificial intelligence to set a new world record for producing algae as a reliable, economic source for biofuel that can be used as an alternative fuel source for jet aircraft and other transportation needs.

Joshua Yuan, Ph.D., AgriLife Research scientist, professor and chair of Synthetic Biology and Renewable Products in the Texas A&M College of Agriculture and Life Sciences Department of Plant Pathology and Microbiology, is leading the research project.
The team’s findings were published in January in Nature Communications. Ongoing research is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy Fossil Energy Office. The work is also being funded by a gift from Dr. John ’90 and Sally ’92 Hood, who recently met with Yuan to discuss his biofuels research program. The gift is managed by the Texas A&M Foundation.
The project team includes Bin Long, a graduate student from the Department of Plant Pathology and Microbiology; Bart Fischer, Ph.D., co-director of the Texas A&M Agricultural and Food Policy Center and Texas A&M Department of Agricultural Economics; Henry Bryant, Ph.D., Department of Agricultural Economics; and Yining Zeng, Ph.D., staff scientist with the U.S. Department of Energy National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
Solving the algae limitations as a biofuel
“The commercialization of algal biofuel has been hindered by the relatively low yield and high harvesting cost,” Yuan said. “The limited light penetration and poor cultivation dynamics both contributed to the low yield.”
Overcoming these challenges could enable viable algal biofuels to reduce carbon emissions, mitigate climate change, alleviate petroleum dependency and transform the bioeconomy, Yuan said.
Yuan has previously been successful at finding methods to convert corn stubble, grasses and mesquite into biodegradable, lightweight materials and bioplastics. His latest project utilizes a patented artificial intelligence advanced learning model to predict algae light penetration, growth and optimal density. The prediction model allows for continual harvest of synthetic algae using hydroponics to maintain the rapid growth at the optimal density to allow best light availability.

The method Yuan and team have successfully achieved in an outdoor experiment is 43.3 grams per square meter per day of biomass productivity, which would be a world record. The latest DOE target range is 25 grams per square meter per day.
“Algae can be used as an alternative energy source for many industries, including biofuel and as jet fuel,” Yuan said. “Algae is a good alternative fuel source for this industry. It’s an alternate feedstock for bioethanol refinery without the need for pretreatment. It’s lower cost than coal or natural gas. It also provides for a more efficient way of carbon capture and utilization.”
Yuan said algae can also be used as a source for animal feed. AgriLife Research has previously investigated algae as a source of livestock protein.
Algae as a renewable energy
Algae biofuel is regarded as one of the ultimate solutions for renewable energy, but its commercialization is hindered by growth limitations caused by mutual shading and high harvest costs.
“We overcome these challenges by advancing machine learning to inform the design of a semi-continuous algal cultivation (SAC) to sustain optimal cell growth and minimize mutual shading,” he said.
Yuan said he is using an aggregation-based sedimentation strategy designed to achieve low-cost biomass harvesting and economical SAC.
“The aggregation-based sedimentation is achieved by engineering a fast-growing blue-green algae strain, Synechococcus elongatus UTEX2973, to produce limonene, which increases cyanobacterial cell surface hydrophobicity and enables efficient cell aggregation and sedimentation,” he said.
Making algae economical energy
Scaling-up the SAC with an outdoor pond system achieves a biomass yield of 43.3 grams per square meter per day, bringing the minimum biomass selling price down to approximately $281 per ton, according to the journal article. In comparison, the standard low-cost feedstock for biomass in ethanol is corn, which is currently approximately $6 per bushel or $260 per ton. However, Yuan’s process does not call for costly pre-treatment before fermentation. Corn must be ground  and the mash must be cooked before fermentation. 
“Algae as a renewable fuel source was a hot topic a decade ago,” Fischer said. “As a result, there’s a lot of skepticism. I was even skeptical. However, the work that Joshua is doing is incredibly innovative. We were excited to partner on this project. At the productivity levels they obtain – and given the low-cost harvest that the strain allows – it shows a lot of promise.”
Yuan said despite significant potential and extensive efforts, the commercialization of algal biofuel has been hindered by limited sunlight penetration, poor cultivation dynamics, relatively low yield, and the absence of cost-effective industrial harvest methods.
“This technology is proven to be affordable and help propel algae as a true alternative form of energy,” he said.
