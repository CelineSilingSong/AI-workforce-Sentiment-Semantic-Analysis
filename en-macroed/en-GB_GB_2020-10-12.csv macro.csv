But Duolingo, self-proclaimed as “the world’s best way to learn a language” and seconded by reviewers at the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, is set to change that with an assist from artificial intelligence (AI). Duolingo launched in 2011, and through a powerful mix of personalized learning, immediate feedback and gamification/rewards, it has become one of the most downloaded educational apps today. Let's take a look at how artificial intelligence helps the company deliver personalized language lessons to its 300 million users.
The Amazing Ways Duolingo Is Using Artificial Intelligence To Deliver Free Language Learning Adobe Stock

Duolingo on a Mission to Offer Free Language Education

Founded in Pittsburgh by Carnegie Mellon University computer scientist Luis von Ahn, who is renowned for creating CAPTCHA, Duolingo’s mission is to “make education free and accessible to everyone in the world.” Today the company’s more than 300 million users receive personalized training on more than 30 distinct languages ranging from Spanish to Navajo to Klingon through its cross-platform app. Learning a language is time-intensive—the U.S. State Department estimates it can take 600 to more than 1,100 class hours to learn a language. Duolingo breaks this effort down into manageable chunks that can be done anywhere at any time individualized for each user and infused with fun and a points-based reward system. Users can access the app for free, but those who don’t want ads can sign up for premium service through a monthly subscription.

AI Powers Duolingo’s Mission

Artificial intelligence is behind Duolingo’s mission to make language education accessible and free to everyone. It starts with an AI-driven placement test to determine the starting knowledge of each user for the language they want to study. For example, if someone signed up to learn French and they have four years of instruction in high school, they will likely be able to start Duolingo’s lessons further along than a user who had never been exposed to French before. To determine exactly where each user’s understanding of the language begins, the placement test adapts as it continues based on if the user answered the previous question correctly or not. In a mere five minutes, this test gives the app a good sense of where each user should start the course. This ability contributes to a positive user experience and reduces the number of those with some knowledge bowing out due to boredom at the beginning.
PROMOTED
Another core feature of the Duolingo app that uses artificial intelligence is known as spaced repetition. This concept delivers personalized language lessons over longer intervals for optimal learning rather than cramming lessons into a short period of time. Additionally, the “lag effect” is also important to Duolingo’s learning techniques. If the gap between practice sessions is lengthened, users improve more. All of this content delivery is controlled on the backend by artificial intelligence.
As learning expands and language proficiency is gained, the user interacts with the content in different ways. AI algorithms using deep learning predict at any given moment the probability of a user being able to recall a word in a given context and then can figure out what that user needs to keep practicing. The algorithms analyze user data to then personalize the learning experience.

In fact, Duolingo generates a wealth of data that is critical when creating predictive models. The amount, type, and uniqueness of the data was one of the reasons the company's AI and research lead Burr Settles decided to join the company in 2013 over bigger, more established companies. Duolingo’s half-life regression statistical model operates based on analyzing error patterns of millions of language learners to inform content delivery that’s relevant for each user and their learning needs.

In an effort to ensure an engaging experience, Duolingo has AI-powered chatbots that help teach language through automated text-based conversations with users who are in the app. Not only do the bots help users improve their language skills by helping them practice conversing in a language, but they get smarter the more they are used. The company has also considered the possibility of expanding into virtual reality technologies to deliver a more immersive experience.

			Using artificial intelligence for image recognition		

 October 13, 2020 
 
				Dominic Lill			

  AI,  artificial intelligence,  Image,  image recognition

Do you find robots cool? Well, don’t we all, until they take over our entire race and have us enslaved. But that is not going to happen because we have the circuit board in our hands. That will happen only if we mess up. When we talk about artificial intelligence, robots are the only things that come to mind.
But you need to understand that artificial intelligence is much more than that. AI is an entire field of science with the purpose of digitizing human qualities in order to enhance the machines to work more like us to get tasks, like image recognition, done on time. Make sense? 
Well, in simple terms, it is like giving human qualities to a machine. Not all of them, just the specific ones required to get the job done. This is exactly what we do when we tend to use AI for image and video processing. We are all aware of how AI can help analyze text, but with a bit of enhancement, it can work for image recognition as well. Wondering how? Continue reading to find out how it is used in everything from web scraping to guiding self-driven cars. 
What is image recognition?
In the context of machines and computers, the term image recognition refers to the ability of a mechanical device to interpret different characteristics in an image. In simple terms, evaluate the image similar to how our brain evaluates it. 
For instance, an image of a scenic place would just be an image for your laptop because of the JNG format type. But when the element of Ai is added to your laptop, it gets an additional brain that helps it identify objects in the image such as mountains, people, places, objects, writing etc. You can give the ability to identify specific characteristics to a machine using AI, and that is what image recognition means. 
How AI helps with image recognition?
Unlike us, machines do not have a brain of their own. Their brain isn’t a ball of neurons but a chipset that you design, which gives them the precise ability of what you want them to do. Using AI for image recognition requires you to design software trained to analyze millions of pre-labeled pictures from different angles, edges, and perspectives to identify specific components. Various algorithms are set in place to precisely do what is told!  
Common examples of image recognition
Using AI for image recognition has become more common than you think. You might not realize it, but you use the feature almost every day. For instance, when you use images to search on Google, the AI of the search engine scraps the web by identifying the objects in the photo you added by matching them with the other images with the same objects on the internet. 
Similarly, online retailers have the same feature in their apps. Social media sites use it for target marketing. Your photo library uses it for a smart photo library feature. It is also used in self-driving cars, autonomous robots and for adding meta-tags to images. In short, it is used in almost all industries today.

Over a billion people around the world are at high risk for retinal eye diseases such as glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy. And yet more than 75 percent of these people do not receive regular screenings.
The reasons vary but, in general, visiting an ophthalmologist can be expensive (depending on insurance coverage), impractical (requiring time off from work) and inconvenient (it can sometimes take months to get an appointment).
But what if the ability to do an eye scan moved from a specialist to your family doctor or local hospital clinic?
That’s what Israeli startup AEYE Health hopes to accomplish with its camera-based artificial intelligence software for quickly diagnosing retinal disease.

The problem is significant. Over 80% of people with diabetes will develop retinopathy within 15 years. Glaucoma, which can be prevented if diagnosed early, is the leading cause of avoidable blindness over the age of 60. The risk of getting age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which can also be vision-threatening, is 30% after the age of 75.
AEYE Health (pronounced A-Eye, like AI – artificial intelligence) simplifies the screening process by removing the ophthalmological middleman.
The company’s software can process and deliver the results of a scan of the fundus (the lower part of the eyeball opposite the pupil) in just a couple of minutes from any type of camera – including, eventually, the cameras on standard smartphone – and from any type of medical office.

“We can train statistical models to discriminate between the two groups,” Zack Dvey-Aharon, the company’s CEO, tells ISRAEL21c. Once the models are up and running, “you just need to activate them. They’re already trained to make a fast call.”
Artificial intelligence in the medical space has generally been used more for decision support than actual diagnosis, but when it comes to ophthalmology, where there is both a shortage of professionals and long wait times for appointments, there is a push toward allowing autonomous AI to do full “diagnostic screening, where the AI makes a medical decision,” Dvey-Aharon says.

Only if the retina scan is flagged as worrisome would you be referred to an eye specialist.

Opening the door to diagnosis
Software algorithms can outperform human ophthalmologists in some areas.
“AI can look at a retinal image and tell the age of a patient,” Dvey-Aharon says, “something even the best doctor can’t do.”
And it can catch hidden problems. “The eye is the only place in the body that, without doing any cutting, gives you a direct view to the blood vessels and nervous system,” Dvey-Aharon says.
“That opens the door to diagnosis of many systemic conditions. You can detect problems like hypertension, cardiovascular issues, different types of cancer, dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.”

The Covid-19 pandemic has only increased the need for technologies like those from AEYE Health. One way the novel coronavirus has been shown to spread is through the eyes, leading some patients to forego a visit to the eye clinic. Might they be more willing to come in for a test through their general practitioner?
AEYE Health’s location in Israel has been a key advantage for the 14-person company, which has its R&D in the heart of Tel Aviv.

“It’s not easy to find top data scientists” in other parts of the world, not to mention finding a group of the real stars in the space, Dvey-Aharon points out. Location and expertise have helped AEYE Health raise $3 million since the company was founded in 2018.
Dvey-Aharon says he isn’t worried by the fact that Google and IBM are crunching data in an effort to make sense of health scans. He sees giant companies more as possible collaborators, pointing out that neither has released a commercial application for retinal scanning.
Clinical trials
AEYE Health is currently conducting clinical trials in the United States. The company hopes to receive FDA certification by the end of 2020.
That would enable the company to sell its software to hospitals, which Dvey-Aharon says are the most suitable environments for AEYE Health’s offering, since you’ll find specialists in geriatrics, endocrinology (who deal with diabetes) and ophthalmology under one roof.
While AEYE Health has developed a software solution, the company plans to partner with hardware manufacturers to offer an integrated bundle to potential customers.
In July, AEYE Health announced a new partnership with UMass Health Care in Massachusetts. The partnership is backed by a BIRD Foundation grant just shy of $1 million.

“The idea is to make sure this works for a large hospital setting,” Dvey-Aharon explains.

Using AEYE Health’s software, clinics can upload data from the camera into the hospital’s system, schedule appointments automatically, generate billing paperwork and transfer results to a patient’s electronic medical record.
Dvey-Aharon envisions a subscription model that would make AEYE Health a “one-stop shop,” he says.
AEYE Health is also eyeing underserved countries “where access to ophthalmologists is very limited,” Dvey-Aharon adds. “Saving people from blindness is important anywhere. And screening is the most important phase.”
He explains that the brain “does amazing things bypassing local problems, so that by the time people don’t see well, it’s too late to treat.”
Dvey-Aharon, an alumnus of the IDF’s 8200 intelligence unit, has a PhD in machine learning. He founded AEYE Health with Danny Margalit, the former founding partner of Aladdin Knowledge Systems, where for 24 years he was the company’s CTO.

It’s really important that leaders don’t ignore this AI- and data-driven revolution – what I call the “intelligence revolution” – or allow other leaders in the organization to ignore it. Working out how to use AI, dealing with people-related challenges, avoiding the ethical pitfalls of AI, making sure you have the right technology in place, and so on – all are key considerations for the business leaders of today and tomorrow.
10 Essential Leadership Qualities For The Age Of Artificial Intelligence Adobe Stock

This technology revolution will change what it means to be a good leader. It makes sense, then, that business leaders in the intelligence revolution will need to adapt. The way we run businesses will change, and the successful leaders of the future will need a slightly different skillset from the traditional skills associated with leaders.

What sort of skills are we talking about? I believe successful leaders in the intelligence revolution will need to cultivate the following 10 leadership skills:



PROMOTED
1. Agility. The pace of change, particularly with AI, is astonishing. Leaders must therefore be able to embrace and celebrate change (including new technologies). And, importantly, they should not view change as a burden, but see it as an opportunity to grow and innovate, both at an individual and organizational level.

2. Emotional intelligence. As more and more workplace activities become automated, softer skills like emotional intelligence and empathy will become more critical for human workers. And if we expect the workplaces of the future to prioritize such human skills, it stands to reason that leaders must model these behaviors themselves.

3. Cultural intelligence. The workplaces of the future will be even more diverse, global and dispersed than they are today. Effective leaders will be able to appreciate and leverage the differences individuals bring to the table, and to respect and work well with people from all backgrounds – even when they share a different world view.

4. Humility. Confidence will still be an important trait in leaders, but the successful leaders of the future will be able to strike a balance between confidence and humility. They will see themselves as facilitators and collaborators, rather than critical cogs to success. In other words, they’ll encourage others to shine.

5. Accountability. Flatter organizational structures, more project-based teams, partnership working – all of these things will lead to organizations becoming more transparent and collaborative. Leaders will therefore need to be more transparent and hold themselves accountable. What’s more, their actions must be in clear alignment with the company’s goals.

6. Vision. To understand the impact of AI on the business and all of its stakeholders, leaders in the intelligence revolution will need that big-picture vision. How will AI transform the organization and lead to new business opportunities? It’s up to leaders to determine this, while managing stakeholders’ needs effectively.

7. Courage. We’ve barely scratched the surface of what AI can do, so leaders will need the courage to face the uncertain, the courage to fail fast, and the courage to change course when the situation calls for a new strategy. As part of this, they’ll need the courage to identify their own weaknesses and be open to coaching and learning. (In fact, as skills become outdated even more quickly in the future, successful leaders will need to cultivate a culture of learning right across the business.)

8. Intuition. There’s no doubt that data-driven decision making is the way forward, but that doesn't mean intuition and instinct will become obsolete, far from it. Particularly as workplaces undergo rapid change, leaders will still require that uniquely human skill of intuition, of being able to “read” what’s not being said.

9. Authenticity. Any new technology brings with it issues around ethics and misuse, not to mention issues around change management. Leaders in the intelligence revolution will therefore need to be able to build trust with customers, employees, and other stakeholders – and that means exuding authenticity. This will become especially important in times of uncertainty, change, or failure.

10. Focus. Finally, with the incredible pace of change, and the continual need to adapt, future leaders will need to maintain a laser-like focus on the organization’s strategic objectives. They’ll need to be able to cut through the chaos and hype to identify what’s really important – especially the initiatives and technology that will help the organization deliver on its goals.

The key takeaway here is that human leadership skills will be just as important in the intelligence revolution, if not more so. People are, and will remain, the most important asset for any business. But what we prize as key leadership skills in the future may look very different to the traditional leadership skills that are valued today. I predict that these softer, more human skills – things like humility and emotional intelligence – will become much more important going forward.

When the Department of Defense rolled out the Artificial Intelligence Strategy in 2018, the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC) was at its core and established the same year. The Naval Postgraduate School is hosting the JAIC’s director, Lieutenant General Jack Shanahan, U.S. Air Force (Retired); and chief operating officer, Mr. Nand Mulchandani, on Tuesday, 13 October to address the topic “Harnessing AI for National Security.” Ahead of this Secretary of the Navy Guest Lecture series event, Lieutenant Commander Karen Kutkiewicz, U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Naval Institute Executive Fellow, interviewed Mr. Mulchandani.
Proceedings: What is the role of Joint Artificial Intelligence Center? How does it interact with the services? 
Mulchandani: The JAIC (pronounced “Jake”) is a center for excellence for AI. The DoD established the JAIC in 2018 and Lieutenant General Shanahan was the plankowner. I joined the team about six months later. Our primary mission initiatives benefit America’s national security, and our servicemembers. My background is as an entrepreneur in the Silicon Valley. The JAIC is a fusion between the U.S. Military and Silicon Valley. This level of teaming together is unique, with tech and military.
Our goal is to deliver AI-enabled capabilities at scale that transforms the DoD for the digital era. We use the best of what is there with the best of new ideas and thinking and merge them together. It is two-sided. On one hand, we know that new technology is rapidly evolving. Just like in the tech industry, there are pathfinders that try everything out, that is our job for the DoD. What new technologies would most benefit us? On the other hand, we get a demand signal from our customer, whether it is a need for business process transformation, innovative health solutions, predictive maintenance, or AI-enabled warfighting capabilities. At the JAIC, our job is to survey the demand side, bring the tech side, and create a solution.
There are three million members in DoD. At the JAIC, we employ 180 people. We cannot drive change ourselves. We need everyone in the DoD to bring their needs to light. We leverage our tech background and thinking. The JAIC’s job is to not make something once. Highly successful business models are leveraged, repeatable, and scalable. That is how we bring AI capability to the entire organization. We are building platforms open to all users of the DoD, and operating at an industrial scale. We research, test, prototype, mechanize, evaluate, and package AI, all for the precise use of our Armed Forces.
Our relationships with the services and combatant commands continue to grow and thrive, and we think of them as our customer base. We have a mission team, and their job is to engage and interact with the combatant commands and the services to understand the command demand signals side of the equation. As we are building out the relationships, we are learning from them what their needs and requirements are to execute their mission. We have service representatives and subgroups for AI policy, testing and evaluation, ethics, education and training, and AI governance. We find common elements to the problems they are having and develop generic solutions that are customizable for their particular use case. The heart of our customer engagement mission is to learn the service’s needs and requirements, take our technological expertise, to create efficiencies for American competitive advantage. 







Proceedings: What advance/s are you most excited to see come to fruition? 
Mulchandani: My aspirational vision is the ability of us as a department to develop crucial software that will be the key determinate to victory in a  future fight. This software will be our literal ability to access and compute data to build more advanced AI products. Software for predictive maintenance will predict failure or success in the field. In the next couple of months, we will be seeing an early version of the breakthrough ‘Joint Common Foundation’, to enable servicemembers at scale to use the technology that we make. The Joint Common Foundation is a cloud-enabled AI platform that will build momentum across the entire DoD enterprise. It will accelerate AI development, testing, and evaluation of new capabilities. General Jack Shanahan has a great analogy for this, the department of electricity. There is no department of electricity anymore but there are electricians. When we do our jobs right, the JAIC will leave behind only power stations and electricians. We will have AI integrated into the fabric of what we do as an organization. This improves the DoD, and that is the win.
Proceedings: Does China or Russia have an advantage in AI? If yes, what are their advantages and what can we do about it?  
Mulchandani​​​​​​​: First, AI is not a single technology. It is a collection of algorithms and modeling. AI used to be called statistics- a collection of technology, string, and numerical data to make predictions. Saying China or Russia is very broad. One country is too wide to be characterized. Tech matures and grows where we focus, where we invest our manpower and resources. There are certain fields where each country is more heavily invested. Look at the great fire wall in China, filtering on key words in searches, facial recognition for tracking of citizens. China does have the lead in certain areas that they care most about, population control, law enforcement, etc. We, as the United States, have not necessarily focused on these areas. 
As Americans, we are the ones innovating, the universities conducting the extensive research, publishing, and implementing technology to scale. There is no question that United States still has the advantage. The challenge is that the Chinese work is in house and the PLA gets the first fruits.  At the JAIC, we work with industry, take their first fruits, and integrate that into our system. The real challenge is that sometimes the military can be rigid. But in our short two-year existence, we are paving the way toward integration and improving the day-to-day life of each servicemember.
Proceedings: What are some ways AI will significantly change our day-to-day lives or day-to-day operations for the military?  
Mulchandani​​​​​​​: We are building a leveraged business model where 180 people hope to change a three-million-person organization.  Our job is to do something so that every marginal piece of inputs or work that can affect 10,000 or 20,000, or 100,000 people. That is the leverage business model and that becomes the heart what the JAIC is aspiring which is by being a Center of Excellence by building a platform that can open to all users in the DoD. We customize the platform to them, and it grows more precise with more data and input. When we are taking about lethality and warfare, we need precision. And not just precision one time, but repeatable precision. AI is becoming woven into the fabric of our personal and professional lives. The JAIC is delivering AI-enabled solutions to our everyday problems that affect our troops around the globe.
Proceedings: Last month, the Center hosted the first-ever International AI Dialogue for Defense, what were the biggest takeaways?
Mulchandani​​​​​​​: For me, the biggest takeaway was that we are closer to our allies than we are apart with respect to systems and ethics. We may be different culturally, but the more we engage with our partners and allies, the more we learn that we agree on most principles and ideas. The resulting dialogue strengthened our alliances. We, the U.S. and the JAIC, are the ones who are leading and sparking this discussion as the host nation. Thirteen countries came together for the AI Dialogue for Defense. Ethics and AI go hand in hand. We agreed upon and used an ethical framework to facilitate open dialogue. That was marked success.One of the biggest challenges to solve in AI is unintended consequences and a primary topic of the Dialogue. Basically, if I can’t explain it, I can’t test it, I can’t trust it, then it would be unpredictable, and have unintended consequences. But if I can explain, test, trust, predict, then it would produce the intended consequences that we expect. Most AI in the world has been productionalized. That is, where the consequences of being wrong is very low, like Siri, Netflix, etc. You can try to change your voice or add more data points to try to fix it, but if it is wrong you watch Tiger King instead of Stranger Things. To date, AI has low consequences as we have deployed AI based cognitive assistance systems without the serious consequences. Now we are dealing with weapons systems. That is why we here at the DoD are spending so much time to ensure excellence that is aligned with America’s laws and values. The problems that we are dealing with have life and death consequences. We are even working on a Search and Rescue product for the Coast Guard. The stakes are high for us to complete our mission. What improvements we do today to accelerate and deliver AI to the warfighter is a game-changer. As I said before, this will be the difference between winning and losing whatever comes next.

Optimizing your training with artificial intelligence

The AI Endurance app helps athletes train smarter to get the most out of themselves ahead of goal races and runs

Markus Rummel got into endurance sports in 2012, and for a while, he had no issues fitting training into his schedule. But he was in university at the time, and after graduating, finding a job and getting married, he struggled to work in as many training sessions as he had before. “I had way less time to train, so I wanted to be more optimal about it,” he says. To do this, he created an app called AI Endurance that uses artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to prepare personalized training plans to help athletes optimize their workouts and perform at their best on race day. 


Today, AI Endurance is used by many athletes around Canada and the world, but when he first designed it, Rummel was the app’s lone client. “Last year, I trained half of my usual load and still got PBs everywhere,” he says. Rummel, who has a PhD in theoretical physics, is an avid triathlete. After several years in the sport, he noticed that everyone has different approaches to training. “Some people go hard a lot and others take it way easier,” he says. “We all fight about what is ‘right,’ but it’s different for everyone. What has worked for me over the years is so different from what’s worked for my friends.”

With AI Endurance, the guesswork is taken out of training, and each user can each finally find their perfect formula for success. So how does it work? After connecting your AI Endurance profile to your Strava, Garmin or other training files, the app will analyze your athletic history and determine what will work best for you. Then, you can edit your weekly availability. If your schedule changes and work or anything else prevents you from training one day, you can simply move a workout to another day in the week. Next, you input your plans for any upcoming races.

“So let’s say you have a race six weeks from now,” Rummel says. “The app will figure out the best thing you can do with your time limitations to get the best possible results.” The app’s AI will not only create a plan for you, but it will constantly update it based on your steady flow of workout data. This ensures that, no matter what changes occur in your life, your training will be optimized and personalized for you.

“With my app, you know that if you do the work, you’re going to see good results,” Rummel says. He adds that even though in-person races are largely on hold for the time being, there’s no reason not to start training with AI Endurance now. “Everyone wants to do well, especially when races come back. Even now you want to improve. The app can do that for you, and it does it in a motivating way. You know that if you put the work in, you’ll get a certain result instead of guessing.”

The graphic’s purpose was to bring together elements of the USAF and USSF to explain the mission while giving a nod to history. At the center of the patch is a T-7A Red Hawk, the USAFs new advanced jet trainer. Half of the aircraft has nodes of a neural network, the fundamental building blocks of machine learning algorithms. This represents a key component of the work at the Accelerator. The USAF logo and the USSF are in formation alongside the aircraft. This represents teamwork to address challenges, while working on broader ethical, moral and societal ramifications. The red rocker below the aircraft connects the T-7A namesake, “Red Hawk,” to the original Tuskegee Airmen and their Red Tail Squadron. The Accelerator builds upon the momentum of the Tuskegee Airmen to help lead the world in Artificial Intelligence development. (U.S. Air National Guard graphic by Staff Sgt.
