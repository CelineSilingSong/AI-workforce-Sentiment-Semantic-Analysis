The Amazing Ways Artificial Intelligence (AI) Can Now Detect Dangers At Work
Adobe Stock






Autodesk’s latest addition to its BIM 360 suite of artificial intelligence (AI) enabled industry tools – Construction IQ – aims to reduce these tragic occurrences. It does this by predicting when falls are likely to happen – as well as any other danger to life, limb, or even just quality of work.
Autodesk’s data scientists hit upon the solution while looking for applications where the massive amount of data collected on modern-day construction sites could be put to use, thanks to the industry’s enthusiastic adoption of mobile tools and sensing devices.
PROMOTED
""Imagine being a construction manager and having to contend with the fact that every X number of months, someone's going to die on the job – it's unfathomable to most of us in white collar jobs,"" says Pat Keaney, Autodesk’s lead on the Construction IQ project.
Construction IQ uses natural language processing (NLP)  techniques – algorithms that parse human language (in this case, text notes created around construction jobs by contractors and subcontractors on site) to assess risk and warn of hazards that may go unnoticed by human safety managers.
Keaney tells me, ""Right now we're focussing on applying NLP … we have partners using image recognition; there are 360-degree cameras, Internet of Things (IoT) that can detect gasses in the air … in my mind there’s no doubt that within the next five years, this technology is going to be saving lives.”
In fact, evidence suggests that it probably already is. I spoke to one construction company, BAM Ireland, which told me that by using Autodesk's BIM 360 platform, they had achieved a 20% reduction in quality and safety issues on site.
They have also increased the amount of time available to staff to spend remedying high-risk dangers on site by 25%.
All of this has become possible thanks to the explosion in the amount of data generated and gathered at construction sites.
""We realized there are these tremendous changes happening in the industry as a result of things like smartphones and tablets,"" Keaney says.
""They've only been around 11 or so years, but they've changed the landscape … instead of carrying around reams of paper, you can look at plans on an iPad, and when you do this, you don't just save time, you generate and collect data.
“Everyone has a phone and a high-definition camera in their pocket … so expand that idea to IoT and sensors, most smart people don’t sit around trying to figure out when concrete has cured now, they put a sensor in it, and the sensor tells them when it’s ready.”
The next stage was a natural leap – taking this data and making it available to the AI tools Autodesk developed for its BIM 360 platform meant a move towards a predictive, data-driven model of construction management.
“Our simple hypothesis was there’s got to be value in this data that will help our customers do a more effective job of managing their crazy, chaotic, every-growing construction projects. That’s what led us to start this exploration.”
This is a perfect example of an increasingly common and productive trend across all industries that are engaging in digital transformation. Digitization results in a wealth of information that can often prove useful far beyond the initial use cases for which it was collected.
As the project got underway, there were initial concerns about how willing companies would be to share the data. These proved to be unfounded, as Keaney explained to me:
“In general, our customers have far exceeded my expectations for willingness and passion for allowing us to help them find value in their data … we said we want to go on an exploration and partner with you guys … if you're interested in what we need is for you to grant us access to your data.
“When we did that, our customers would get really excited and dig in and want to spend more time with us … we were able to show them things in their data they had never seen before.
“Are there certain companies that were more conservative and wary? Certainly – in the US they were more willing to take a risk, Europe was a little more cautious – which is one of the reasons it was so exciting to see it embraced by BAM Ireland.”
Data covering over 150 million construction issues harvested from 30,000 real-world projects has been used to train the algorithms that BAM used to drive their impressive results in the field of site safety.
Their digital construction operation manager, Michael Murphy, told me how the platform had allowed them to move away from the siloed approach to data the construction and civil engineering firm had traditionally taken.
He said “When we started, we found our biggest problem was our data was very inconsistent, so when we were setting up projects we were being inconsistent around how we were capturing data, or the issue types we were capturing.
“When we engaged with Construction IQ, the first thing we had to do was tackle this inconsistency – that was a big lesson learned.
“This meant we were able to get better insights into the issues and challenges across our projects … whereas previously we may have just been doing something on a mobile phone or an iPad for the sake of doing it on an iPad … we weren’t really getting the benefits of having standardized datasets that we could query, and get better insights from.”
It seems inevitable that as technologies such as machine learning, NLP and deep learning continue to prove their worth, solutions built on them will become increasingly widely adopted across construction, as well as any other industries that can benefit from a consolidated approach to data gathering and analytics.
In the short term, this is likely to save lives, while in the long term, it will contribute to the development of safer working practices and standards.
As Keaney puts it, “I think safety is something that everyone can agree is important – nobody should be holding their data close to their chest around these issues, it wouldn’t be good behavior.
""The whole industry shares these problems … and all of this tech is going to save lives; there's no doubt about it … from a safety perspective, the benefits are clear, compelling, and really easy to understand.""Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",The Amazing Ways Artificial Intelligence (AI) Can Now Detect Dangers At Work,Enterprise & Cloud,The Amazing Ways Artificial Intelligence (AI) Can Now Detect Dangers At Work,True,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Forbes Homepage', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Innovation', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/innovation/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Enterprise Tech', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/enterprise-tech/'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But what about the world of art? Art curator and gallery director Aidan Meller pondered this question when he studied the “terrifying” implications of widespread AI development. Mr Meller, whose background is strictly in dealing with art, has no prior experience with robotics or artificial intelligence. However, his fascination with the cultural zeitgeist of today – Artificial Intelligence – has resulted in the birth of a new kind of artist.

We needed a new voice to discuss AI and its implicationsAidan Meller, gallery directorIn the same way, he argued, Claude Monet pioneered impressionistic painting in response to the invention of the camera, so will artists find new ways of creating art.Mr Meller said the invention of the camera “expanded the palette” of possibilities for artists to dip into and innovate.In the same way, he hopes Ai-Da can have a similar effect on a world more and more reliant on technology.READ MORE: Mona Lisa brought to LIFE for the first time with DISTURBING 'deep-fake' AI technologyArtificial Intelligence: Ai-Da is the brainchild of Aidan Meller (right) (Image: NICKY JONHSTON)So, how does the humanoid robot work? Unfortunately, the robot does not quite have the dexterity to master the paintbrush.But Ai-Da’s brilliance is hidden in the AI algorithms, which help her interpret the world through her robotic camera eyes.Ai-Da absorbs information through her eyes, which she then processes and interprets into unique artistic visions.AI algorithms developed at Oxford University then relay the information back into her robotic arm – developed by AI engineers at Leeds University – to draw on a canvas.Ai-Da has managed to create this way unique portraits of computing pioneers such as Alan Turing or Ada Lovelace – the robot’s namesake.READ MORE: More than half of UK FEARS robots will take overArtificial Intelligence: The robot's AI was developed at Oxford University (Image: VICTOR FRANKOWSKI)Artificial Intelligence: Ai-Da was designed to look and act as human as possible (Image: GUY BELL)And Ai-Da’s algorithms also have the capability of creating abstract images of from shapes and colours on the Cartesian coordinate system.The results are multi-faceted abstracts, which Mr Meller said have so far been met with hugely positive reactions.Ai-Da’s work was revealed this week (June 5) during a press conference and exhibition at Lady Margaret Hall in Oxford, where the robot’s work could be seen up-close.

It can help trace missing children, but misidentifies people of color. It can help detect cancer, but may recommend the wrong cure. It can help track criminals, but could aid foreign enemies in targeting voters. It can improve efficiency, but perpetuate long-standing biases.close dialogAdvertisementclose dialogThe “it” is artificial intelligence, a technology that teaches machines to recognize complex patterns and make decisions based on them, much like humans do. While the promised benefits of the technology are profound, the downsides could be damaging, even dangerous.Last year police in New Delhi, for example, traced 2,930 missing children in four days by using an experimental facial recognition technology that identified them by examining a database of 45,000 kids living in shelters and homes. Yet a facial recognition tool developed by Amazon and tested by the American Civil Liberties Union in 2018 incorrectly identified 28 members of Congress as having been arrested for a crime, disproportionately picking out African American lawmakers, including civil rights icon John Lewis.Significant advances in computers’ ability to recognize visual patterns and human languages, including voice and text recognition, and to learn without supervision have brought machines closer to achieving cognitive tasks once reserved for humans. Vast quantities of data held privately and by governments are the necessary “food” that computers must digest to learn the new skills.[jwp-video n=”1″]
Lawmakers and regulators still grappling with the downsides of the internet and social media era, such as loss of privacy, criminal hacking and data breaches, are now trying to balance the promises and perils of artificial intelligence. Industry groups, lobbyists and unions are angling to shape the debate over regulations affecting technologies that could one day bring more job losses because of increased automation. Civil rights groups and some technologists are calling for greater oversight to prevent bias and discriminatory practices.Determining the way forward is also complicated because artificial intelligence has emerged almost organically from existing technology and data, unhampered by restrictions on privacy and use, said Jason Schultz, a law professor at New York University who also oversees law and policy for NYU’s AI Now Institute. “We are now trying to figure out whether the scaffolding we have for the internet era is sufficient for AI or do we need a whole new foundation,” he said.Northwell Health, New York state’s largest health care provider, for example, uses Amazon’s Echo voice-activated device to assist hospital patients with queries on everything from medications to music. Typical Echo devices store recordings of user requests on Amazon servers, but Northwell uses its own servers to comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the landmark law that safeguards patient information.“But is that enough or do we need new regulations?” Schulz asked.
Good and evil
Members of Congress are waking up to the potential dangers of widespread use of AI technologies. They have drafted bills that would not only require more transparency and accountability over these automated systems, but also allow users to withhold certain information from the large data sets that drive artificial intelligence.“It’s a fundamental way in which decisions are made now — algorithms and computers,” said Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who is co-sponsoring a bill dubbed the Algorithmic Accountability Act, introduced in April. “And it seems to me that there’s not much transparency, not much disclosure, and that’s what we sought to do in our bill.”The bill would require the Federal Trade Commission to prepare rules requiring companies to test their AI-powered systems for accuracy, fairness, bias, discrimination, privacy and security, and to correct errors if they find them. The bill is backed by Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat running for president, and New York Democratic Rep. Yvette D. Clarke.When introducing the legislation, Booker described his African American parents’ experience with “real estate steering” in 1969, when agents coaxed black couples away from some neighborhoods.While such practices have been outlawed, opaque automated advertising systems driven by algorithms could perpetuate discrimination and avoid scrutiny, he said.Tech-savvy lawmakers say Congress must be better educated before passing legislation addressing artificial intelligence to avoid repeating the failures made with earlier internet technologies.California Democrat Ro Khanna, a member of the Congressional Artificial Intelligence Caucus whose district includes part of Silicon Valley, said he’s putting together a working group of economists, lawyers, academics and others to help lawmakers draft legislation.“That may allow us to get ahead of the curve when it comes to AI and preventing misuse of AI in a way that we weren’t ahead of the curve on social media,” said Khanna, a national co-chairman of Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders’ bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.The AI Caucus is still mostly a digital forum that has yet to meet in person, said Rep. André Carson, an Indiana Democrat who is part of the group. The goal of the caucus is not to turn lawmakers into tech wizards but to get them up to speed on key issues, he said.As a “Star Wars” fan who also grew up watching the TV series “Knight Rider,” which featured a souped-up Pontiac Trans Am that could talk and help fight injustices, Carson said he’s both excited and concerned about the possibilities for AI.Technologies that could enable the FBI and other law enforcement agencies to target criminals and potential terrorists could as easily be used by adversaries to target voters and whip up fear, Carson said. “Whatever is created for good can be used for evil purposes,” he said.
K Street awakens
Regardless of the complexities of the technology and the slow learning curve lawmakers face, lobbyists are on top of the technology on behalf of their clients and have ramped up their outreach to lawmakers over AI.In 2015, Carnegie Mellon University was the lone organization to disclose “artificial intelligence” as a federal lobbying issue, according to quarterly reports filed with Congress. In the first months of this year, in contrast, nearly 100 interests have identified it, a signal that K Street sees it as an area of growth.Washington’s largest lobbying practice at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld offers one example.Earlier this year the firm hired former Rep. Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican who left at the conclusion of the 115th Congress after serving as chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee. Smith and others at the firm have been pitching existing and potential clients about artificial intelligence.Akin Gump held a roundtable discussion with lawmakers in the AI caucus plus outside stakeholders. Smith predicts a lot of activity this year, with multiple bills touching AI already introduced.“I think the government is also rightly concerned about privacy but equally concerned about the misuse of AI, malicious use,” Smith said. “Capitol Hill, Congress, the House and Senate, are just sort of trying to feel their way forward. I think they’re really just at the beginning of information gathering and the self-education process.”The tussle to regulate technology also is playing out between employers and unions.The trucking industry is seeking a federal safety standard for “highly automated vehicles,” arguing that such an approach is better than different state-by-state standards.Chris Spear, president of the American Trucking Associations, said artificial intelligence can help improve safety and reduce congestion and pollution, citing the industry’s $75 billion a year loss because of congestion.But unions, fearing that self-driven trucks may take away jobs, lobbied against a bill that would have set a federal standard for automated commercial vehicles.Despite promises that the technology will make drivers’ lives easier, “it remains to be seen how that stuff’s going to roll out and whether the true goal is really just to take someone’s job,” said Sam Loesche, legislative representative for the Teamsters.The push and pull between technologists and companies on the one side and labor unions and advocates on the other is likely to continue as lawmakers and regulators begin looking for ways to draw boundaries around artificial intelligence.“Without any question, AI is coming,” former Rep. Smith said. “We need to make sure it’s heading in the right direction.”[jwp-video n=”2″]

Fortnite: How Artificial Intelligence and Analytics Make It More Fun

It is also representative of a relatively new paradigm in gaming – one that has altered the software landscape until it has become almost unrecognizable in recent years. Known as games-as-a-service (GaaS), the game is funded through subscriptions and regular transactions by its players rather than a one-off fee.
Although this may not seem all that new to those of us old enough to remember the coin-guzzling likes of Pac Man and Space Invaders, GaaS means the continuous revenue stream funds ongoing development and improvement of the game.
PROMOTED
And its cloud-based nature (along with the vast userbase) means huge amounts of data is available to developers Epic – the game generates a staggering two petabytes per month. All of this can be mined for insights into what keeps their players coming back for more – and contributed towards generating $3 billion in profit during 2018.
Data is the fuel of artificial intelligence. Every piece of data players generate by interacting with each other, and the platform can now be analyzed with smart algorithms and used to make the game more entertaining and immersive, which in turn helps to grow the user base.
These analytics – running on tools including Amazon Sagemaker – are used to identify KPIs such as the length of time players are engaging with the game – be that hours per day or sessions per week – and understand what it is that provides the “hook” that keeps players coming back.
Once this is done, the company can make changes to the game's internal structure, such as deploying different gameplay modes encouraging players to interact in different ways, to drive growth across its key metrics.
Much of Epic’s infrastructure supporting Fortnite is built on Amazon’s AWS cloud service, and the company’s director of platform, Chris Dyl, told AWS Summit in New York “We use the data for everything, from ARPU (average revenue per user) to game analysis and improvements.”
At peak times, the Fortnite analytics pipeline ingests 40gb of data every minute into the Epic data lake, that as of last year was reported to stand at 14 petabytes in size, and to be growing by two petabytes a month.
The precise details of how data is used to improve gameplay and drive player engagement are kept under wraps. But tools and services related to data analytics that it is known to use include Amazon S3, the Apache Spark cluster computing framework, and the Tableau visualization software.
As with other GaaS operations, it is likely that Epic use their data to balance gameplay within Fortnite’s “battle royale” tournaments – free-for-all skirmishes where 100 players compete to be the last man or woman standing in an ever-shrinking arena.
Additionally, design decisions such as the implementation of new gameplay modes will be based on what is learned about the types of battle that are popular with the userbase.
Because battles in Fortnite are relatively free-form, rather than being structured around missions or objectives as is the norm in video games, Epic can use analytics and AI to make interesting psychological observations around player behavior. Will players tend to go it alone in a ""lone wolf"" fashion, or will they form temporary alliances and pacts to work together on self-determined objectives – such as taking down stronger players or holding strategically important terrain? What level of risk are players willing to take when it comes to exposing themselves or leaving cover, to collect better weapons and equipment? AI can be used to monitor this ""emergent"" gameplay and adapt the challenge to suit players' style.
Emergent gameplay is nothing too new in gaming and marks a trend away from games where every individual element was hand-crafted by human game designers, towards allowing players to create rules for themselves in a ""sandbox"" environment. AI is a natural next step in this evolution, enabling the prospect of ""virtual referees"" that can adapt to what players are doing and ensure the game's infrastructure adapts too, to cope with this behavior.
Epic had also developed a great deal of its own infrastructure itself – way before Fortnite existed, its Unreal Engine was one of the most commonly used gameplay engines in both independent and ""triple-A,"" big studio game design.
Carrying on this tradition, it recently made Epic Online Services freely available – a platform for creating, maintaining, and managing massively multiplayer, cloud-based games.
The move into the cloud and AI technology taken by Epic is driven by its partnership with Tencent, which invested $330 million in exchange for a 40% share of the company in 2012. Tencent is the most gaming-focused of the Chinese tech giants. It has pioneered the development of the cloud, mobile and microtransaction infrastructure rolled out by Fortnite, and now being adopted across the games industry.Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Bernard MarrFollowingFollowBernard Marr is a world-renowned futurist, board advisor and author of Generative AI in Practice: 100+ Amazing Ways Generative Artificial Intelligence is... Read MoreEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions",Fortnite: How Artificial Intelligence and Analytics Make It More Fun,Enterprise & Cloud,Fortnite: How Artificial Intelligence and Analytics Make It More Fun,True,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'name': 'Forbes Homepage', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'name': 'Innovation', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/innovation/'}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Enterprise Tech', 'item': 'https://www.forbes.com/enterprise-tech/'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Novant Health's new innovation institute will focus on using AI to enhance personalized patient care.  (Novant Health)
Add Novant Health to the growing list of health systems that have opened institutes dedicated to artificial intelligence.The health system, based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, launched the Novant Health Institute of Innovation & Artificial Intelligence (AI), which will use AI to enhance personalized patient care. The institute will focus on the advanced technologies required to provide highly personalized care and accelerated solutions with actionable data and insights for preventive prediction, diagnosis and treatment to Novant Health’s patients, the health system said.Novant Health consists of 640 care locations, including 15 hospitals and hundreds of outpatient facilities and physician clinics servicing patients in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia.To drive this work, Novant will partner with the health system's physicians as well as technology companies, research organizations, universities and other healthcare organizations to leverage the work already in place within Novant Health’s digital products and services team. RELATED: Mount Sinai, Hasso Plattner Institute launch new $15M digital health center""The institute will help Novant Health develop both clinical and operational solutions that streamline patient care across our health care system,"" Eric Eskioglu, M.D., executive vice president and chief medical officer for Novant Health, said in a statement.Some Novant Health team members will rotate in and out of the institute as subject matter experts on an as-needed basis while others may have full-time assignments there, the health system said. A Novant Health spokeswoman said the Institute will not have a separate building but will entail ""a set of processes and constructs that allow team members from all parts of Novant Health to explore and experiment with emerging AI-based capabilities, acting as a distributed team, for the benefit of our patients and communities.""“It’s an exciting time to be in health care because of the proliferation of AI-based solutions that anticipate patient needs and improve the overall experience,” said Angela Yochem, executive vice president and chief digital and tech officer for Novant Health. “As we build our competencies in AI and machine learning, we want our team members, business partners and providers to have a place where they can present their ideas to improve the delivery of care.”The institute is led jointly by Eskioglu and Yochem.RELATED: Accenture: AI, blockchain will have 'transformational' impact in next 3 yearsA recent Accenture survey of healthcare executives found that the majority of healthcare organizations are experimenting with at least one of these emerging technologies: distributed ledgers, artificial intelligence, extended reality or quantum computing. And 41% of healthcare executives believe AI will have the greatest impact on their organization over the short term.Two-thirds of healthcare executives believe the combination of these technologies will have a ""transformational"" or ""extensive"" impact on their organizations in the next three years. Novant joins a growing list of health systems and universities launching centers dedicated to AI and innovation. Mount Sinai Health System and the Hasso Plattner Institute in Germany have launched a new $15 million digital health center, based at Mount Sinai in New York City, with the aim of accelerating the use of AI and other emerging technologies in clinical care.In March, Cleveland Clinic announced the opening of its new Center for Clinical Artificial Intelligence with a focus on developing innovative clinical applications of AI and leveraging machine-learning technology in hopes of improving healthcare delivery in areas such as diagnostics, disease prediction and treatment planning, the organization said.Banner Health, headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, announced in May a new initiative called the Banner Innovation Group focused on bringing the health system's innovation efforts all under one umbrella. Some of its projects include an artificial intelligence triage tool and a chatbot for the emergency department.Stony Brook University also recently opened the Institute for AI-Driven Discovery and Innovation to advance AI research across multiple disciplines, including healthcare.

Digicloud’s Google Cloud partners can guide your success! (AI) bootcamps, kicking off in Cape Town. Dubbed “AI in Khayelitsha”, this first series of youth month bootcamps will take place on 7 June through to 9 June.  The Khayelitsha AI learning drive marks the second time the Motlanthe Foundation hosts such an event in Cape Town this year. In March, the foundation hosted the “AI in Mitchells Plain” bootcamp.  “AI in Khayelitsha” forms part of the nationwide social impact bootcamp programme, AI in Africa, focused on exposing young South Africans to technology that will prepare them for a digitally-driven economy. According to a statement, the girls-only bootcamps target girls aged 15- to 18-years-old from historically disadvantaged communities, to motivate them to create purposeful, high-impact solutions that tackle challenges ranging from community safety to unemployment and education. “AI in Khayelitsha” will gather 60 girls from Chris Hani Secondary, Harry Gwala Secondary, Joe Slovo Secondary, Siphamandla Secondary and Usasazo High in Khayelitsha.

The three-day exercise will expose these learners to a working environment of cutting-edge technologies, including how to build computer chatbots, package their individual tech ideas and solutions, and pitch their innovations to a panel of judges.” This series of bootcamps comes as young South Africans have expressed uncertainty in their future career prospects in the age of the fourth industrial revolution.  This week, Deloitte released its annual millennial survey, which revealed the majority (working and unemployed) of young South Africans believe the next digital revolution will make it harder to get a job or change jobs in the future.  Mustapha Zaouini, head of innovation at the Kgalema Motlanthe Foundation, says: “The aim of this youth month is to give young people a glimpse of what the future of work may look like and give them access to tools, concepts and access to 21st century skills.” From 13 to 15 June, “AI in Africa” will head to Johannesburg to partnerPARTNERSell Cloud PBX under your own brand and be more profitable with Wanatel's Unified Communication solution with the Gauteng Provincial Government and African Women and Youth Foundation at the fifth annual Gauteng youth career, jobs and entrepreneurship expo in Nasrec.  The youth expo features various activities, including exhibitions, discussions and workshops, and provides information and live services to youth on careers, jobs and work exposure, as well as how to start, run and operate a business. On 17 June, Fliptin will partner with Veromo Enterprise to host a digital dialogue under the theme, “21st Century Skills”, which will bring together leaders from the corporate and government sectors, academics, entrepreneurs and job-seekers to discuss the accessibility of opportunities for young people. The Motlanthe Foundation says throughout the series of events, learners will be mentored by leading professionals and entrepreneurs to deliver a stimulating series of workshops to excite and inspire the youth to reach their fullest potential. “All content is carefully crafted to merge technology and entrepreneurship through an understanding of tech (AI), as well as design thinking and business models.”Share",Artificial intelligence bootcamp heads to Khayelitsha,,,,"[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@type': 'WebSite', '@id': 'https://www.itweb.co.za', 'name': 'Home'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@id': 'https://www.itweb.co.za/categories/j5alrvQgkY1MpYQk', 'name': 'Artificial Intelligence'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'name': 'Artificial intelligence bootcamp heads to Khayelitsha', 'item': 'https://www.itweb.co.za/article/artificial-intelligence-bootcamp-heads-to-khayelitsha/DZQ58vVJEPWvzXy2'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
