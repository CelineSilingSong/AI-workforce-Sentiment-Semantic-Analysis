As artificial intelligence opens up and becomes democratized through platforms offering generative AI, it’s likely to alter tasks within at least 80% of all jobs, a new analysis suggests. Jobs requiring college education will see the highest impacts, and in many cases, at least half of peoples’ tasks may be affected by AI. It’s extremely important to add that affected occupations will be significantly influenced or augmented by generative AI, not replaced.


That’s the word from a paper published by a team of researchers from OpenAI, OpenResearch, and the University of Pennsylvania. The researchers included Tyna Eloundou with OpenAI, Sam Manning with OpenResearch and OpenAI, Pamela Mishkin with OpenAI, and Daniel Rock, assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania, also affiliated with OpenAI and OpenResearch.

The research looked at the potential implications of GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models and related technologies on occupations, assessing their exposure to GPT capabilities. “Our findings indicate that approximately 80% of the U.S. workforce could have at least 10% of their work tasks affected by the introduction of GPTs, while around 19% of workers may see at least 50% of their tasks impacted,” Eloundou and her colleagues estimate. “The influence spans all wage levels, with higher-income jobs potentially facing greater exposure” — particularly jobs requiring college degrees. At the same time, they observe, “considering each job as a bundle of tasks, it would be rare to find any occupation for which AI tools could do nearly all of the work.”

PROMOTED
The researchers base their study on GPT-4, and use the terms large language models (LLMs) and GPTs interchangeably.

Their findings suggest that programming and writing skills are more likely to be ”influenced” by generative AI. On the other hand, occupations or tasks involving science and critical thinking skills are less likely to be influenced. Occupations that are seeing or will see a high degree of AI-based influence and augmentation (again, emphasis on influence and augment) include the following:


Interpreters and translators
Survey researchers
Poets, lyricists and creative writers
Animal scientists
Public relations specialists
Writers and authors
Mathematicians
Tax preparers
Financial quantitative analysts
Web and digital interface designers

GPTs “are improving in capabilities over time with the ability to complete or be helpful for an increasingly complex set of tasks and use-cases,” Eloundou and her co-authors point out. They caution, however, that the definition of a “task” is very fluid. “It is unclear to what extent occupations can be entirely broken down into tasks, and whether this approach systematically omits certain categories of skills or tasks that are tacitly required for competent performance of a job,” they add. “Additionally, tasks can be composed of sub-tasks, some of which are more automatable than others.”

There’s more implications to AI than simply taking over tasks, of course. “While the technical capacity for GPTs to make human labor more efficient appears evident, it is important to recognize that social, economic, regulatory, and other factors will influence actual labor productivity outcomes,” the team states. There will be broader implications for AI as it progresses, “including their potential to augment or displace human labor, their impact on job quality, impacts on inequality, skill development, and numerous other outcomes.”
Still, “accurately predicting future LLM applications remains a significant challenge, even for experts,” Eloundou and her co-authors caution. “The discovery of new emergent capabilities, changes in human perception biases, and shifts in technological development can all affect the accuracy and reliability of predictions regarding the potential impact of GPTs on worker tasks and the development of GPT-powered software.”
An important takeaway from this study is that generative AI — not to mention AI in all forms — is reshaping the workplace in ways that currently cannot be imagined. Yes, some occupations may eventually disappear, but those that can harness the productivity and power of AI to create new innovations and services that improve the lives of customers or people will be well-placed for the economy of the mid-to-late 2020s and beyond.

Search interest in ChatGPT has reached a 2,633% boost in interest since last December, shortly after its launch. For the artificial intelligence and machine learning industry, and for those working in tech as a whole, OpenAI’s chatbot represents a true crossing of the Rubicon.
A generative form of AI, it uses prompts to produce content and conversations, whereas traditional AI looks at things such as pattern detection, decision making, or classifying data. We already benefit from artificial intelligence, whether we realise it or not—from Siri in our Apple phones to the choices Netflix or Amazon Prime make for us to the personalisations and cyber protection that lie behind our commercial interactions.
ChatGPT is just one of an increasing number of generative AI tools, including Bing Chat and Google Bard. DeepMind’s Alpha Code writes computer programs at a competitive level; Jasper is an AI copywriter, and DALL-E, MidJourney and Stable Diffusion can all create realistic images and art from a description you give them.
As a result, generative AI is now firmly embedded in the mainstream consciousness, with much credit going to ChatGPT’s easy to use interface, and its ability to produce results that can be as sublime as they are ridiculous. Want it to produce some Python code? Sure thing—and it can generate you a funny Limerick too, if you’d like.

For more information check out TNW's Privacy Policy.*According to Salesforce, 57% of senior IT leaders believe generative AI is a game changer, and because it is intuitive and helpful, end users like it as well.
While your job may be safe from AI (for the moment), ChatGPT-generated content has gotten into the the top 20% of all candidates shortlisted for a communications consultant role at marketing company Schwa, and it has also passed Google’s level 3 engineering coding interview.
Roles that are likely to resist the advent of generative AI include graphic designers, programmers (though they are likely to adopt AI tools that speed up their process) and blockchain developers, but many other jobs are likely to be performed by AI in the (near) future.
These include customer service jobs—chatbots can do this efficiently. Bookkeeping or accounts roles are also likely to be replaced as software can do many of these tasks. Manufacturing will see millions of jobs replaced with smart machinery that does the same job, but faster.
But, while AI may replace some jobs, it will also generate a slew of new ones.
The World Economic Forum predicts that the technology will create 97 million new jobs by 2025. Jobs specifically related to the development and maintenance of AI and automation will see growing adoption as AI integrates across multiple industries.
These could include data detectives or scientists, prompt engineers, robotics engineers, machine managers, and programmers, particularly those who can code in Python which is key for AI development. AI trainers and those with capabilities related to modelling, computational intelligence, machine learning, mathematics, psychology, linguistics, and neuroscience will also be in demand.
Healthcare looks set to benefit too, with PwC estimating that AI-assisted healthcare technician jobs will see an upward surge. A sector that is already creating new jobs is automated transportation with Tesla, Uber, and Google investing billions into AI-driven self-driving cars and trucks.

Microsoft’s recent Copilot product enhancement in Office 365 shows how a new generation of artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities is being embedded into business processes. Similarly, Google has begun previewing application programming interfaces (APIs) to access to its own generative AI, via Google Cloud and Google Workplace.







The recent Firefly announcement of text-to-image generative AI from Adobe also demonstrates how the industry is moving beyond gimmicky demonstrations used to showcase these systems into technology that has the potential to solve business problems.
Microsoft 365 Copilot uses large language models with business data and Microsoft 365 apps to boost the Microsoft office productivity suite with an AI-based assistant that helps users work more effectively. For instance, in Word, it writes, edits and summarises documents; in PowerPoint, it supports the creative process by turning ideas into a presentation through natural language commands; and in Outlook, it helps people manage their inbox. Copilot in Teams sits behind online meetings, making summaries of the conversation and presenting action points.
Adobe has launched the initial version of its generative AI for image-making, trained using Adobe Stock images, open content and public domain content where copyright has expired. Rather than trying to make digital artists, designers and photographers redundant, Adobe has chosen to train its Firefly system, based on human-generated images, which is focused on generating content based on images and text effects, which, according to Adobe, is safe for commercial use.
Google has put into beta its large language model, Bard, and embedded two generative AI models, PaLM API and MakerSuite, in Google Cloud and Google Workspace. Introducing the new development, Google CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a blog post: “Bard seeks to combine the breadth of the world’s knowledge with the power, intelligence and creativity of our large language models. It draws on information from the web to provide fresh, high-quality responses. Bard can be an outlet for creativity, and a launchpad for curiosity.”
While there are numerous online comparisons of the two rival large language models, ChatGPT is regarded as an older technology, but Microsoft’s $10bn investment in OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, represents a very public commitment to it.
Speaking on the BBC’s Today programme, Michael Woodridge, director of foundational AI research at the Turing Institute, said: “Google has got technology which, roughly speaking, is just as good as OpenAI. The difference is that OpenAI and Microsoft have got a year’s head start in the market, and that’s a year’s head start in the AI space, where things move so ridiculously quickly.”

Jurassic-2 is the latest model from AI21 Labs. The model is the successor to Jurassic-1, which was trained on 178 billion parameters, three billion parameters more than GPT-3.
OpenAI has introduced its latest large language model. With multimodal capabilities, it's expected to perform better while still suffering from some of the same problems.



In a recent blog discussing the speed with which OpenAI’s ChatGPT has developed into a model that seemingly understands human speech, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates said: “Any new technology that’s so disruptive is bound to make people uneasy, and that’s certainly true with artificial intelligence. I understand why – it raises hard questions about the workforce, the legal system, privacy, bias and more. AIs also make factual mistakes and experience hallucinations.”
For Gates, AI like ChatGPT offers a way for businesses to automate many of the manual tasks office workers need to do as part of their day-to-day job.
“Although humans are still better than GPT at a lot of things, there are many jobs where these capabilities are not used much,” he said.
“For example, many of the tasks done by a person in sales (digital or phone), service, or document handling (like payables, accounting or insurance claim disputes) require decision-making, but not the ability to learn continuously. Corporations have training programs for these activities, and in most cases, they have a lot of examples of good and bad work. Humans are trained using these data sets, and soon, these data sets will also be used to train AIs that will empower people to do this work more efficiently.”

Uses for business
Discussing the use of generative AI and large language models in business, Rowan Curran, an analyst at Forrester, said: “The big development here is that these large language models essentially give us a way to interact with digital systems in a very flexible and dynamic way.” This, he said, has not been available to a large swathe of users in the past, and they give users the ability to interact with data in a “more naturalistic way”.
Regulators are keen to understand the implications of this technology. The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for instance, recently posted an advisory regarding generative AI tools like ChatGPT. In the post, the regulator said: “Evidence already exists that fraudsters can use these tools to generate realistic but fake content quickly and cheaply, disseminating it to large groups or targeting certain communities or specific individuals. They can use chatbots to generate spear-phishing emails, fake websites, fake posts, fake profiles and fake consumer reviews, or to help create malware, ransomware, and prompt injection attacks. They can use deep fakes and voice clones to facilitate imposter scams, extortion and financial fraud. And that’s very much a non-exhaustive list.”
The FTC Act covering prohibition on deceptive or unfair conduct can apply if an organisation makes, sells or uses a tool that is designed to deceive – even if that’s not its intended or sole purpose.
Curran said the technology used in these new AI systems is opaque to human understanding. “It’s not actually possible to look inside the model and find out why it’s stringing a sequence of words together in a particular way,” he said.
They are also prone to stringing together words to make phrases which, while syntactically correct, are nonsensical. This phenomenon is often described as hallucination. Given the limitations of the technology, Curran said it will be necessary for human curators to check the results from these systems to minimise errors.

Workers’ fear of new artificial intelligence technology makes sense: that technology has the potential to eliminate their jobs. But if we didn’t live under capitalism, AI could be used to liberate us from drudgery rather than hurl us into poverty.

Lately, I have been experimenting with artificial intelligence image-generating programs. Their power is astonishing. They’re not just good at the technical aspect of creating “art” but appear to be genuinely creative, producing works that not only match the competence of a highly skilled artist but that can be surprising, interesting, and even beautiful.




Of course, everything still depends on the human who is entering the prompt to tell the AI what to do. But nobody who sees these things in action can doubt that we’re entering a very strange new era in which a great deal that could be done by hand will soon be automated.
Many artists are up in arms about the new AI programs — and with good reason. Some are furious that their works have been used as training data without their permission. Others fear that corporate clients will simply turn to machines to do the work that used to be done by human hands. AI is causing the cost of image generation to plummet. In a capitalist economy, where everyone depends for survival on the value of their labor in the marketplace, a massive drop in the value of a skill will cause widespread suffering.
Art is far from the only domain about to be transformed by generative AI. Paralegals, programmers, market researchers, customer-service agents, financial analysts, and many other professions are at risk of seeing much of their work automated in the near future. OpenAI’s hugely successful ChatGPT not only writes bad jokes and slightly better poetry but is even helping to write published research papers. The models are only getting better, too. The newly released GPT4 is already being used to write whole books.
The powers of this new technology are frightening. Scammers are already using the ability to generate realistic “deepfakes” to fool people into thinking their relatives are asking them for money. Credible-looking misinformation can now be produced at lightning speed, an especially unfortunate development at a time when we lack trusted media institutions.
The problem is that new generative AI is being introduced into a capitalist society that is ill-equipped to handle it.
While Noam Chomsky, Gary Marcus, Erik J. Larson, and others have produced convincing arguments that the fear of artificial “superintelligence” coming in the near term is overstated, there are all kinds of ways in which the technology as it already exists can wreak havoc on society.





People are right to be terrified of the disruptions that AI might cause within our lifetimes. But when we think about what those disruptions actually are, it’s clear that the main problem is not actually the development of the technology itself. Introduced under a different economic and political system, few of the risks would be so grave.
The problem is that new generative AI is being introduced into a capitalist society that is ill-equipped to handle it.
Artists, for example, are mostly not afraid of AI because they fear having a machine be better at art. Chess players didn’t stop playing chess when the computer program Deep Blue beat grandmaster Garry Kasparov. And if art is made for pleasure and self-expression, it doesn’t matter what anyone else can do.

The problem is that, in our world, artists have to make a living through their art by selling it, and so they have to think about its market value. We’re introducing a technology that can utterly wreck people’s livelihoods, and in a free-market economic system, if your skills decline in value, you’re screwed.
It’s interesting that we talk about jobs being “at risk” of being automated. Under a socialist economic system, automating many jobs would be a good thing: another step down the road to a world in which robots do the hard work and everyone enjoys abundance. We should be able to be excited if legal documents can be written by a computer. Who wants to spend all day writing legal documents? But we can’t be excited about it, because we live under capitalism, and we know that if paralegal work is automated, that’s over three hundred thousand people who face the prospect of trying to find work knowing their years of experience and training are economically useless.





Luddism is a rational approach to automation in a capitalist society. If machines threaten your job, fight the machines. Even a reactionary like Tucker Carlson has said that politicians should intervene to stop automation, for example, by banning self-driving trucks, because having millions of people thrown out of work would cause too much social disruption. But that solution is absurd: Why would we have people do needless labor that could be done by robots? Truck drivers have their health destroyed and don’t get to see their families for long stretches of time. Even when a machine could do the hard work instead, we’re going to make people do it?
We can expand our imagination far further than Carlson’s. What if finding out that your job could be automated was a thrill? What if it meant that a worker could be paid while the robot did the work? How about this: once the job that you train for is automated, you get an automation pension and get to relax for the rest of your life. Everyone will be praying their job is next on the list to go.
How about this: once your job is automated, you get an automation pension and get to relax for the rest of your life. Everyone will be praying their job is next.
We shouldn’t have to fear AI. Frankly, I’d love it if a machine could edit magazine articles for me and I could sit on the beach. But I’m afraid of it, because I make a living editing magazine articles and need to keep a roof over my head. If someone could make and sell an equally good rival magazine for close to free, I wouldn’t be able to support myself through what I do. The same is true of everyone who works for a living in the present economic system. They have to be terrified by automation, because the value of labor matters a lot, and huge fluctuations in its value put all of one’s hopes and dreams in peril.





Most of the other problems AI could cause really boil down to problems of the way power and wealth are apportioned in our existing society. Because the world is organized into militarized nation-states, we have to worry that AI technology will be used in terrifying new superweapons. Because we let scams and fraud flourish in our Wild West economy, we will see a lot of people get rich using AI to prey on hapless consumers. The profit motive is already socially destructive, but AI will make it much worse, because it will allow companies to figure out how to more efficiently trick and exploit people. The new technologies are being developed by private corporations that have no incentive to ensure that a benefit to them is a benefit to all.
We need to be clear on the source of the problems with AI. They are real and will accelerate the crisis that socialists are devoted to helping humanity solve. But the problem is not technology itself. Technology should be a tool for liberation. Unless we transform the economic system, however, it will be a tool for ever greater exploitation and predation.

AI Won’t Kill Our Jobs, It Will Kill Our Job Descriptions—and Leave Us Better Off



By Vanessa Bates Ramirez
March 22, 2023 







The hype around artificial intelligence has been building for years, and you could say it reached a crescendo with OpenAI’s recent release of ChatGPT (and now GPT-4). It only took two months for ChatGPT to reach 100 million users, making it the fastest-growing consumer application in history (it took Instagram two and a half years to gain the same user base, and TikTok nine months).
In Ian Beacraft’s opinion, we’re in an AI hype bubble, way above the top of the peak of inflated expectations on the Gartner Hype Cycle. But it may be justified, because the AI tools we’re seeing really do have the power to overhaul the way we work, learn, and create value.
Beacraft is the founder of the strategic foresight agency Signal & Cipher and co-owner of a production studio that designs virtual worlds. In a talk at South by Southwest last week, he shared his predictions of how AI will shape society in the years and decades to come.
A Revolution in Knowledge Work
Beacraft pointed out that with the Industrial Revolution we were able to take skills of human labor and amplify them far beyond what the human body is capable of. “Now we’re doing the same thing with knowledge work,” he said. “We’re able to do so much more, put so much more power behind it.” The Industrial Revolution mechanized skills, and today we’re digitizing skills. Digitized skills are programmable, composable, and upgradeable—and AI is taking it all to another level.
Say you want to write a novel in the style of a specific writer. You could prompt ChatGPT to do so, be it by the sentence, paragraph, or chapter, then tweak the language to your liking (whether that’s cheating or some form of plagiarism is another issue, and a pretty significant one); you’re programming the algorithm to extract years worth of study and knowledge—years that you don’t have to put in. Composable means you can stack skills on top of each other, and upgradeable means anytime anytime an AI gets an upgrade, so do you. “You didn’t have to go back to school for it, but all of a sudden you have new skills that came from the upgrade,” Beacraft said.
The Era of the Generalist
Due to these features, he believes AI is going to turn us all into creative generalists. Right now we’re told to specialize from an early age and build expertise in one area—but what happens once AI can quickly outpace us in any domain? Will it still make sense to become an expert in a single field?
“Those who have expertise and depth in several domains, and interest and passion and curiosity across a broad swathe—those are the people who are going to dominate the next era,” Beacraft said. “When you have an understanding of how something works, you can now produce for it. You don’t have to have expertise in all the different layers to make that happen. You can know how the general territory or field operate, then have machines abstract the rest of the skills.”
For example, a graphic designer who draws a comic book could use AI-powered design tools to turn that comic book into a 3D production, and he doesn’t have to know 3D modeling, camera movement, blending, or motion capture; AI now enables just one person to perform all of the virtual production elements. “This wouldn’t have been possible a couple years ago, and now—with some effort—it is,” Beacraft said. The video below was created entirely by one person using generative AI, including the imagery, sound, motion, and talk track.

Generative AI tools are also starting to learn how to use other tools themselves, and they’re only going to get better at it. ChatGPT, for example, isn’t very good at hard science, but it could pass those kinds of questions off to something like WolframAlpha and include the tool’s answer in its reply.
This is not only going to change our work, Beacraft said, it’s going to change our relationship with work. Right now, organizations expect incremental employee improvement in narrowly-defined roles. Job titles like designer, accountant, or project manager have key performance indicators that typically improve two to three percent per year. “But if employees only grow incrementally, how can organizations expect exponential growth?” Beacraft asked.
AI will take our traditional job roles and make them horizontal, giving us the ability to flex in any direction. As a result, we’ll have just-in-time skills and expertise on demand. “We will not lose our jobs, we will lose our job descriptions,” Beacraft said. “When organizations have teams of people working horizontally, all that new capability is net new, not incremental—and all of a sudden you have exponential growth.”
More Work, Not Less
That growth could do the opposite of what the predominant narrative tells us: that AI, robotics, and automation will take over various kinds of work and do away with our jobs. But AI could very well end up creating more work for us.
For example, teams of scientists using AI to help them run experiments more efficiently could increase the number of experiments they perform—but then they have more results, more data to analyze, and more work sifting through all this information to ultimately draw a conclusion or find what they’re looking for. But hey—AI is getting good at handling extra administrative work, too.
We may be in an AI hype bubble, but this technology is reaching more people than it ever has before. While there are certainly nefarious uses for generative AI—just look at all the students trying to turn in essays written by ChatGPT, or how deepfakes are becoming harder to pinpoint—there are as many or more productive uses that will impact society, the economy, and our lives in positive ways.
“It’s not just about data and information, it’s about how these AIs can help us shape the world,” Beacraft said. “It’s about how we project what we want to create onto the world around us.”

In this blog post, I’m going to go over 6 functionalities that I find useful in LangChain.You can find the code for this blog post on my Github repo here. You will need to install the needed packages, import packages, and set up API keys (see cells 1–3 in my notebook) before running any of the code below.1. LangChain integrates with many LLM providersWith the same interface, you get access to many LLM models from various LLM providers including OpenAI, Cohere, AI21, Huggingface Hub, Azure OpenAI, Manifest, Goose AI, Writer, Banana, Modal, StochasticAI, Cerebrium, Petals, Forefront AI, PromptLayer OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepInfra, and self-hosted Models.Here is an example of accessing the OpenAI ChatGPT model and GPT3 model, Cohere’s command-xlarge model, and Google’s Flan T5 model hosted on Hugging Face Hub.chatgpt = ChatOpenAI(model_name='gpt-3.5-turbo')gpt3 = OpenAI(model_name='text-davinci-003')cohere = Cohere(model='command-xlarge')flan = HuggingFaceHub(repo_id=""google/flan-t5-xl"")Then we can give a prompt to each of these models and see what they return. One thing to note is that for chat models, we can specify is the message is a human message, an AI message, or a system message. That’s why for the ChatGPT model, I specified my message as a human message.2. Question answering with external documentsAre you interested in building a question-answering bot with external documents? Are your documents saved in PDF, txt file, or even Notion? And what if I would like to do a question-answering both with YouTube videos?No problem, LangChain’s got you covered. LangChain provides a lot of document loaders: File Loader, Directory Loader, Notion, ReadTheDocs, HTML, PDF, PowerPoint, Email, GoogleDrive, Obsidian, Roam, EverNote, YouTube, Hacker News, GitBook, S3 File, S3 Directory, GCS File, GCS Directory, Web Base, IMSDb, AZLyrics, College Confidential, Gutenberg, Airbyte Json, CoNLL-U, iFixit, Notebook, Copypaste, CSV, Facebook Chat, Image, Markdown, SRT, Telegram, URL, Word Document, Blackboard. Do you have another source that’s not listed here? You can contribute and add to LangChain since it’s open-source!Here is an example where we use the TextLoader to load a local txt file, create the VectoreStore index, and query your index. Intuitively, your documents will be split and embedded into vectors and stored in a vector database. The query finds which vector is the closest to the question vector in the vector database.The exciting news is that LangChain has recently integrated the ChatGPT Retrieval Plugin so people can use this retriever instead of an index. What’s the difference between an index and a retriever? According to LangChain, “An index is a data structure that supports efficient searching, and a retriever is the component that uses the index to find and return relevant documents in response to a user’s query. The index is a key component that the retriever relies on to perform its function.”3. Keep/Summarize Chat HistoryWhen you chat with ChatGPT, it doesn’t keep your chat history. You will need to copy and paste your chat into the new prompt to let it aware of the history. LangChain solves this problem by providing several different options for dealing with chat history — keep all conversations, keep the latest k conversations, summarize the conversation, and a combination of the above.Here is an example where we use ConversationBufferWindowMemory to keep the latest 1 round of conversation, use ConversationSummaryMemory to summarize previous conversations, and use CombinedMemory to combine two methods:from langchain.llms import OpenAIfrom langchain.prompts import PromptTemplatefrom langchain.chains import ConversationChainfrom langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory, CombinedMemory, ConversationSummaryMemoryconv_memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(    memory_key=""chat_history_lines"",    input_key=""input"",    k=1)summary_memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=OpenAI(), input_key=""input"")# Combinedmemory = CombinedMemory(memories=[conv_memory, summary_memory])_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE = """"""The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.Summary of conversation:{history}Current conversation:{chat_history_lines}Human: {input}AI:""""""PROMPT = PromptTemplate(    input_variables=[""history"", ""input"", ""chat_history_lines""], template=_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE)llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)conversation = ConversationChain(    llm=llm,     verbose=True,     memory=memory,    prompt=PROMPT)Here is the result where you can see the summary of the conversation and the latest conversation passed into the prompt.4. ChainsSometimes you might want to chain different LLMs. For example,You may want the output of the first LLM to serve as the input of the second LLM.Or you may want to summarize the outputs of the first and the second LLM and pass the summary in as input to the third LLM.Or you may want to chain your language model with another utility chain to do math or Python operation.Here is an example of the most basic SimpleSequentialChain method. The first chain asks ChatGPT to get a good product name for a company that makes colorful socks. ChatGPT returns “Rainbow Sox Co.” The second chain uses this name as input and asks ChatGPT to write a catchphrase for the company “Rainbow Sox Co.” ChatGPT wrote: “Put a little color in your step with Rainbow Sox Co!”from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAIfrom langchain import LLMChainfrom langchain.prompts.chat import (    ChatPromptTemplate,    HumanMessagePromptTemplate,)human_message_prompt = HumanMessagePromptTemplate(        prompt=PromptTemplate(            template=""What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?"",            input_variables=[""product""],        )    )chat_prompt_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([human_message_prompt])chat = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.9)chain = LLMChain(llm=chat, prompt=chat_prompt_template)second_prompt = PromptTemplate(    input_variables=[""company_name""],    template=""Write a catchphrase for the following company: {company_name}"",)chain_two = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=second_prompt)from langchain.chains import SimpleSequentialChainoverall_chain = SimpleSequentialChain(chains=[chain, chain_two], verbose=True)# Run the chain specifying only the input variable for the first chain.catchphrase = overall_chain.run(""colorful socks"")print(catchphrase)5. AgentAn agent has access to the language model and a suite of tools for example Google Search, Python REPL, math calculator, and more. The agent uses LLM and various frameworks to decide which tools to use for which task. This is very similar to the ChatGPT Plugins. Here is an example:We loaded two tools in this example: serpapi is for Google Search and llm-math is for doing math calculations. We asked “Who is Leo DiCaprio’s girlfriend? What is her current age raised to the 0.43 power?” The language model first comprehended the question and decided to take the search action that fires up the search API calls. Then it got the result from the search agent, decided to use llm-math to do calculate the math, and then got the final result.In another example, instead of using the llm-math as a calculator, we can use the Python REPL to execute a Python code for the calculation:6. ChatGPT PluginsChatGPT Plugins just came up this week and LangChain already added the ChatGPT Plugins feature. Here is an example, where we use the AIPluginTool to load the plugin from a shopping website. This plugin is exactly the same as the one OpenAI uses. When we ask the question “what t shirts are available in klarna?” The LLM decided to use the Klarna plugin and got a response of a series of OpenAI Spec and then decided to do a requests to get data, and it was able to return great answers.from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAIfrom langchain.agents import load_tools, initialize_agentfrom langchain.tools import AIPluginTooltool = AIPluginTool.from_plugin_url(""https://www.klarna.com/.well-known/ai-plugin.json"")llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)tools = load_tools([""requests""] )tools += [tool]agent_chain = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=""zero-shot-react-description"", verbose=True)agent_chain.run(""what t shirts are available in klarna?"")ConclusionOverall, I’m quite impressed with the capabilities of LangChain and how fast the community is able to add new features. There are also many other features that I didn’t mention in this blog post including data augmentation, few-shot learning, evaluation, model comparison, and more. I hope this blog post helps you have a better understanding of various LangChain features.

Advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence someday could affect human careers.









Why isn’t everyone already unemployed? After all, experts have been predicting for decades that technological automation might soon take most of our jobs. With the rise of even more powerful artificial intelligence (AI) and robotic technologies, these same fears are leading to a fresh round of worse-case forecasts about the displacement of skills and sectors. 
A new study forecasts that “up to 49 percent of workers could have half or more of their tasks exposed” to AI-powered large language models like OpenAI’s GPT-4. A decade ago, researchers at the University of Oxford published a widely cited study that similarly predicted 47 percent of U.S. jobs were at high risk of automation. 


  

The good news is that the sky is not falling due to AI. Largely the opposite of what the Oxford scholars predicted about AI job losses came true. Since 2013, the U.S. economy has added 16 million jobs and the unemployment rate fell steadily despite continued automation and increasing robotization of many workplaces. The profession that the Oxford report said faced the highest risk of technological disruption—insurance underwriters—saw employment grow 16.4 percent. Meanwhile, the biggest employment problem the economy faces today is that many business sectors are struggling to find workers to fill open positions. The White House even announced a set of new initiatives to lure more Americans back into the workforce.
There are other reasons to be skeptical about grim forecasts regarding AI and employment. First, many past predictions about technologically induced unemployment were wrong because, as noted in a new R Street Institute report on the history of automation fears, we often lack the imagination to describe future jobs or worker skills. A review of old government labor market forecasts or economic papers finds no mention of today’s hottest jobs or skills. Glassdoor’s 2022 best jobs list includes job titles such as: full stack engineer, enterprise architect and machine learning engineer. These jobs would not have been comprehensible to analysts or economists in past decades.
Second, pundits often fail to appreciate how humans adapt rapidly in the face of technological change. Where experts see ominous threats because of new technologies, many others see an opportunity to create new businesses and jobs. A new book, “Working with AI: Real Stories of Human-Machine Collaboration,” offers dozens of case studies of firms integrating algorithmic technologies in the workplace today and shows how organizations are “practicing augmentation, not large-scale automation.” We are using our machines to create entirely new skills and professions.
We’ve seen this story before. Until the 1960s, human “calculators” did hard math on paper and chalkboards until mainframe computers came along and took over those jobs. But that automation freed up those workers to build even better computing machines. The result was the digital revolution, with entrepreneurs and workers seizing new opportunities.
Finally, many technological trends get over-hyped but often fail to materialize. The past decade has seen a lot of hype about autonomous vehicles, leading to much speculation about the potential for job loss for professional drivers. But it turns out that robotic driving is much harder than anticipated and there continues to be a massive shortage of human drivers. 
Market forecasts also tend to overlook how social norms and cultural resistance affect technological adoption. A robot could potentially cut your hair or even be your therapist, but in both cases most people will want an actual human doing that job. Many tasks on airplanes today are handled by autopilot technology, which has dramatically improved aviation safety, but we still want human pilots in the cockpit.


  

Many jobs will be susceptible to AI and automation, however. Government can try to help reskill workers, even though past retraining programs have not fared well. To better prepare the workforce of the future, policymakers can use a mix of policies to enhance STEM education, tax deductions for retraining, better online learning programs, technical recertification programs, portable benefits solutions and vocational apprenticeship models. It is equally important that lawmakers relax barriers to labor mobility and employment flexibility, especially occupational licensing rules. 
But AI isn’t going away and to prosper, we’ll need to learn how to quickly adapt alongside our latest technological creations.

Generative AI describes artificial intelligence models that, when trained on massive data sets, are capable of automatically producing content in the form of text, images, audio and video — all by predicting the next word or pixel.
What Is Generative AI?Generative AI is a form of artificial intelligence in which algorithms automatically produce content in the form of text, images, audio and video. These systems have been trained on massive amounts of data, and work by predicting the next word or pixel to produce a creation.

Typically, it starts with a simple text input, called a prompt, in which the user describes the output they want. Then, various algorithms generate new content according to what the prompt was asking for.

“It’s essentially AI that can generate stuff ... The quality of the output is why people are so excited.”

What began as OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT in 2022 has now become a subcategory of artificial intelligence that is growing at a breakneck pace, with tech giants like Microsoft, Google and Amazon hopping on the bandwagon.
“It’s essentially AI that can generate stuff,” Sarah Nagy, the CEO of Seek AI, a generative AI platform for data, told Built In. And, these days, some of the stuff generative AI produces is so good, it appears as if it were created by a human. “The quality of the output is why people are so excited,” Nagy said.
Popular Generative AI ToolsChatGPT: ChatGPT is an AI-powered chatbot developed by OpenAI, with a unique ability to not only generate written content but also converse with users fluently.
DALL-E 2: Also created by OpenAI, DALL-E 2 can generate realistic images with nothing more than a short text prompt thanks to a process called diffusion, which begins with a pattern of random dots that gradually form an image.
Gemini: Gemini is a generative AI chatbot created by Google, based on its model of the same name. Formerly called Bard, it can answer questions asked by users or create new content from text or image prompts.
Midjourney: Midjourney is a text-to-image generator that produces pieces that are so impressive that it is the only platform of its kind to win an art competition.
Claude: Released by the company Anthropic, Claude is an AI assistant that runs on the Claude 2.1 LLM and uses ‘constitutional AI,’ relying on ethical principles to guide its outputs.
Alexa: Amazon’s newly redesigned voice assistant is powered by a large language model that allows it to be more conversational.

How Does Generative AI Work?
At its core, generative AI technology is able to work due to three specific building blocks: Generative adversarial networks, transformers and large language models.
 
Generative Adversarial Networks
None of this was really possible until around 2014 with the introduction of generative adversarial networks, or GANs — machine learning models that have two neural networks competing with each other in order to become more accurate in their predictions. One neural network artificially manufactures fake outputs disguised as real data, while the other works to distinguish between the artificial data and real data — all the while using deep learning methods to improve their techniques. AI-generated images, videos and audio would not be possible without GANs.
 
Transformers
Transformers are a type of machine learning model that makes it possible for AI models to process and form an understanding of natural language. Transformers allow models to draw minute connections between the billions of pages of text they have been trained on, resulting in more accurate and complex outputs. Without transformers, we would not have any of the generative pre-trained transformer, or GPT, models developed by OpenAI, Bing’s new chat feature or Google’s Gemini chatbot.
 
Large Language Models
The final ingredient of generative AI is large language models, or LLMs, which have billions or even trillions of parameters. LLMs are what allow AI models to generate fluent, grammatically correct text, making them among the most successful applications of transformer models.
In general, the recent acceleration of technical progress and usage of generative AI has been nothing short of revolutionary. And it doesn’t appear to be slowing down anytime soon.
Dive Deeper  How Does AI-Generated Art Work? 
How Are Generative AI Models Trained?
Generative AI models are trained by feeding their neural networks large amounts of data that is preprocessed and labeled — although unlabeled data may be used during training. 
A common method for training generative AI models is employing diffusion models. Diffusion models add noise to training data, then remove the noise as they learn how to reconstruct the data as it was before. Before diffusion models arose, generative adversarial networks were the most popular training method.  
Regardless of the approach, generative AI models must be evaluated after each iteration to determine how closely their generated data matches the training data. Teams can adjust parameters, add more training data and even introduce new data sets to accelerate the progress of generative AI models.         
 
What Types of Output Can Generative AI Produce?
Generative AI has become known for producing:
Text: With ChatGPT ushering in a generative AI rush, written text is commonly associated with generative AI tools. 
Images: Lensa first created buzz around generative AI images on social media, and more image generators are now available.    
Videos: Motion visuals are also undergoing change, with AI video generators providing various editing features. 
Audio: AI has left its mark in the music industry, providing audial support for professional and casual musicians alike. 
 
How Is Generative AI Being Used?
The implementation of generative artificial intelligence is altering the way we work, live and create. It’s a source of entertainment and inspiration, as well as a means of convenience. And if a business or field involves code, words, images or sound, there is likely a place for generative AI. Looking ahead, some experts believe this technology could become just as foundational to everyday life as the cloud, smartphones and the internet itself.
Some Uses of Generative AIDebug code
Write speeches
Write song lyrics
Idea generation
Write personalized emails
Write social media posts
Create 3D objects in games
Speed up game development with code completion

For one, software developers have increasingly been looking to generative AI tools like Tabnine, Magic AI and Github Copilot to not only ask specific coding-related questions, but also fix bugs and generate new code. And AI text generators are being used to simplify the writing process, whether it’s a blog, a song or a speech. 
“I think it can be helpful for sparking creativity and ideation. That’s what I use it for,” Jordan Harrod, a Ph.D candidate at Harvard and MIT and host of an AI-related educational YouTube channel, told Built In. In fact, she used an AI text-generator to help write a speech for Gen AI, a generative AI conference recently hosted by Jasper. “That did not end up being the final talk, but it helped me get out of that writer’s block because I had something on the page that I could start working with,” she said.
AI-generated text has also become a go-to resource for teams that need to produce clear, written content at scale, such as marketing or sales.
“If you look at sales teams, they’re constantly on the phone, they’re sending emails, they’re on LinkedIn and social media trying to generate a lot of content and use a lot of content,”  Srinath Sridhar, the co-founder and CEO of sales-focused generative AI startup Regie.ai, told Built In. His company Regie.ai and other similar tools automate all of that — the personalized emails, the call scripts, and so on. “We take generative AI and then apply it to all the sales workflows for sales people.”

Generative AI has also made waves in the gaming industry — a longtime adopter of artificial intelligence more broadly. Now, generative AI is transforming not only game development, but also game testing and even gameplay. Sony-owned Haven Studios and Electronic Arts have been working to fold this technology into the making of its games while Roblox unveiled plans to implement generative AI capabilities into its Roblox Studio building tool.

“We are seeing this incredible potential, where people can just use natural language to describe things the way they are used to describing them, and then create them.”

The goal is to “democratize content creation,” Stefano Corazza, the head of Roblox Studio, told Built In, removing the technological hurdles that usually come with game development and allowing anyone to be a content creator — whether they’re a game designer working in a professional studio or a 10-year-old just discovering video games.
“Generative AI is just the best thing that has happened to us,” he continued. “We are seeing this incredible potential, where people can just use natural language to describe things the way they are used to describing them, and then create them.”
In addition to the natural language interface, Roblox also plans to roll out generative AI code-completion functionality to help speed up the game development process.
“We are really pushing real-time collaboration for building worlds, coding and all aspects of experience creation. And at the same time we want to make it easier and faster to create new content,” Corazza added. “Generative AI is the best tool that we have at the moment to really make the process easier and more accessible.”

Advantages of Generative AI
Generative AI promises to simplify various processes, providing businesses, coders and other groups with many reasons to adopt this technology.
 
Easy to Use
Early versions of this technology typically required submitting data via an API, or some other complicated process. Developers then had to familiarize themselves with special tools and then write applications using coding languages like Python. Today, using a generative AI system usually requires nothing more than a plain language prompt of a couple sentences. And once an output is generated, they can usually be customized and edited by the user.
 
Improved Decision-Making
For instance, Seek allows companies to essentially ask their data questions without ever having to touch the data itself. By adding Seek to their data stack, a given company’s employees can get whatever information they need of their proprietary data by typing in a simple query, instead of having to bombard their data science team with ad-hoc questions — allowing them to get whatever information they need quickly and efficiently.
“Anybody is able to ask or instruct AI in natural language,” Seek CEO Nagy said. “And able to get so many things done so quickly that they just can’t get done now without spending weeks of manual work.”
 
Increased Efficiency
To be sure, generative AI’s promise of increased efficiency is another selling point. This technology can be used to automate tasks that would otherwise require manual labor — days of writing and editing, hours of drawing, and so on. 
 
Cost Savings
The speed and automation that generative AI brings to a company not only produces results faster than they would ordinarily be produced, but it also has the potential to save businesses money. Products and tasks completed in less time leads to a better customer experience, which then contributes to greater revenue and ROI. 
 
Faster Business Operations
The speed, efficiency and ease of use permitted by generative AI is what makes it such an appealing tool to so many companies today. It’s why companies like Salesforce, Microsoft and Google are all scrambling to incorporate generative AI across their products, and why businesses are eager to find ways to fold it into their operations.
“People are looking for nails to hit using this hammer,” Sridhar said. “It’s a very new piece of tech that has fundamentally changed what you can do from even five years back.”

Challenges of Generative AI
Still, this technology also comes with quite a few challenges. Its mass adoption is fueling various concerns around its accuracy, its potential for bias and the prospect of misuse and abuse.
 
Lack of Accountability 
Because tools like ChatGPT and DALL-E were trained on content found on the internet, their capacity for plagiarism has become a big concern. And issues related to whether AI companies have rights to use the data that trained their system, whether the output of generative engines can be copyrighted, and who is responsible if an AI system generates defamatory or dangerous outputs, do not have clear answers.

“There is going to be an explosion of content ... With big powers comes big responsibility.”

“It’s all coming from the same training data, so the creativity and originality of creating things kind of goes away when you do that,” YouTuber Harrod said. “We don’t really have a great framework for things like attribution, in this particular case. And then compensation and royalty systems.”
 
Less Supervision and Safeguards
For the most part, laws specific to the creation and use of artificial intelligence do not exist. This means most of these issues will have to be handled through existing law, at least for now. It also means it will be up to companies themselves to monitor the content being generated on their platform — no small task considering just how quickly this space is moving.
“There is going to be an explosion of content,” Roblox Studio’s Corazza said. “[Companies’] responsibility is to make sure the content that’s generated doesn’t offend anyone, and lets people create with civility.”
 
Inaccurate Responses 
Generative AI systems also tend to get things completely wrong. Their propensity for “hallucinations,” or creating information that is factually inaccurate, can lead to a mass spread of misinformation.
Nagy likens generative AI to an improv comedy performer: “If you’re pretending to be a character, you have to just spit out content that conveys that you’re that character, when in reality if you don’t know what you’re talking about you’re still going to make the scene work.”
This is true of all generative AI. At the moment, there is no fact-checking mechanism built into this technology. Models don’t have any intrinsic mechanism to verify their outputs, and users don’t necessarily do it either.
“That’s a really hard problem to solve,” Harrod said. “When it comes to most generative AI outputs, I do worry about people just taking the output as fact and moving on.”

Limited Capabilities and Access
While much of the recent progress pertaining to generative artificial intelligence has focused on text and images, the creation of AI-generated audio and video is still a work in progress.
In 2020, OpenAI released Jukebox, a neural network that generates music (including “rudimentary singing”) as raw audio in a variety of genres and styles. A series of other AI music generators have followed, including one created by Google called MusicLM, and the creations are continuing to improve. 
The same goes for AI generated voices. For instance, VALL-E, a new text-to-speech model created by Microsoft, can reportedly simulate anyone’s voice with just three seconds of audio, and can even mimic their emotional tone. It’s worth noting, however, that much of this technology is not fully available to the public yet.
 
Development of Deepfakes
There are a number of platforms that use AI to generate rudimentary videos or edit existing ones. Unfortunately, this has led to the development of deepfakes, which are deployed in more sophisticated phishing schemes. But this facet of generative AI isn’t quite as advanced as text, still images or even audio.
“We’re not quite at the point where you can type in ‘Make me a YouTube video that does XYZ,’ and have something come out that’s really quite as useful in terms of something that you’d use for actual content,” Harrod said. Still, she added, “it’s definitely a field that’s moving fast.”

A Brief History of Generative AI
While breakthroughs like ChatGPT and DALL-E have certainly placed generative AI in the spotlight, the concept of AI-generated content can actually be traced all the way back to the 1960s with the invention of ELIZA — a simple chatbot created by MIT professor Joseph Weizenbaum.
That being said, generative AI as we understand it now is much more complicated than what it was half a century ago. Thanks to advancements in natural language processing, generative AI systems can take raw data in the form of written and spoken words and turn them into written sentences and speech, which are represented as vectors using various encoding techniques. Raw images can be transformed into visual elements, too, also expressed as vectors.
 
The Future of Generative AI
Despite its challenges and shortcomings, the future of generative AI looks bright, particularly in the wake of OpenAI announcing the release of API access to ChatGPT — which promises to usher in a wave of new chatbots and other generative AI interfaces.
“I hope we make tools that can be used for good. And I hope we make tools that people need. Not just make tools for the sake of making them, but make tools because they further our goals as people and societies,” Harrod said.

“I hope we make tools that can be used for good. And I hope we make tools that people need.”

OpenAI also unveiled its much-anticipated GPT-4 in March 2023, which will be used as the underlying engine for ChatGPT going forward. In addition, the company has started selling access to GPT-4’s API so that businesses and individuals can build their own applications on top of it.
While GPT-4 promises more accuracy and less bias, the detail getting top-billing is that the model is multimodal, meaning it accepts both images and text as inputs, although it only generates text as outputs. Right now, an AI text generator tends to only be good at generating text, while an AI art generator is only really good at generating images. Multimodal capabilities could be a real game changer.
“What we are going to have in the next few years is all of those pieces coming together so that you can have multiple modes of communication simultaneously,” Sridhar said. “So you can write a script, you can have a video that goes with the script, you can actually have voice-overs that go with the video.”

Artificial intelligence tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT are coming for the American workforce — and if you're an educated, white-collar worker making up to $80,000 a year, you're among the most likely to be affected, researchers say.Researchers from OpenAI and the University of Pennsylvania conducted a study to see how GPT-4 — OpenAI's latest, most advanced language-processing model — may impact the American workforce.

The researchers wanted to find out which jobs are most likely to be ""exposed"" to the model's capabilities; the study defines exposure as ""economic impact without distinguishing between labor-augmenting or labor-displacing effects.""Using job data from the US Department of Labor, the researchers found that up to 80% of the US labor force could see ""at least 10% of their work tasks affected"" by GPT language models and that 19% of workers ""may see at least 50% of their tasks impacted,"" according to the study.

But deeper analysis found that the impacts of AI on the workforce may affect some workers more than others.Those who work jobs with ""higher wages"" are at risk of higher exposure than workers with lower wages, the study found — ""a result contrary to similar evaluations of overall machine learning exposure."" The impact of AI on jobs increases as salaries get closer to $80,000.Jobs in the ""information processing industries,"" like IT, are most exposed to generative AI, while jobs in ""manufacturing, agriculture and mining"" are the least exposed. That's because roles that use ""programming and writing skills"" are most in-line with GPT's capabilities.Some of the jobs listed as ""occupations with highest exposure"" include tech jobs like blockchain engineers; data-heavy roles like mathematicians, financial quantitative analysts, accountants, and tax preparers; and communication careers such as writers, public relations specialists, interpreters and translators, poets, and lyricists.

Given how these white-collar jobs require advanced skills, it makes sense that the researchers also found that workers with bachelor's, master's, and other professional degrees are at high risk of exposure to AI. The opposite was also discovered to be true: Jobs that only require a high school diploma, vocational school, or on-the-job training — including, food preparation workers, electricians, barbers, and medical assistants — may not feel the brunt of AI's impact.The researchers did not respond to Insider's immediate request for comment before publication.

The study comes as many workers turn to impressive generative AI tools to do things like develop code, write articles, and generate lesson plans, rekindling an ongoing debate on whether AI will replace the need for human workers.While some labor experts say that AI could replace certain jobs, others believe that it will simply make workers more productive.

Researchers acknowledge that the study isn't perfect — nor is it meant to be definitive. Still, they conclude that it is possible that generative AI models can make ""human labor more efficient,"" but that ""social, economic, regulatory, and other factors"" may influence actual labor outcomes.""As capabilities continue to evolve, the impact of GPTs on the economy will likely persist and increase, posing challenges for policymakers in predicting and regulating their trajectory,"" researchers said. ""Further research is necessary to explore the broader implications of GPT advancements, including their potential to augment or displace human labor, their impact on job quality, impacts on inequality, skill development, and numerous other outcomes.""

Back in January, when ChatGPT started making news as the artificial intelligence tool of the future, Wesley Wildman tore up his lesson plan and instead assigned his undergraduate students in Data, Society and Ethics to write a policy for responsible use of generative AI programs in the classroom.
Only a few weeks later, the Faculty of Computing & Data Sciences has adopted that class project as the department’s official policy.
“It’s from the first week of the first BU course on the ethics of computing and data sciences, in our first semester in the new building,” says Azer Bestavros, BU’s inaugural associate provost for computing and data sciences. “I could not have written a better script.”
Azer Bestavros
Wildman is a professor of philosophy, theology, and ethics and of computing and data sciences, who splits his time between the School of Theology and the Faculty of Computing & Data Sciences. The 47 students in his class planned to abide by their Generative AI Assistance (GAIA) Policy themselves and thought it might serve as a starting point for others around campus. But they didn’t think it would become CDS policy so soon after they started working on it.
“It’s been really interesting and something that definitely was unexpected,” says Olivia Bene (CAS’23), a computer science major in the class. Wildman “understands that his classroom is full of people who understand technology and know how to use it, so it’s better to get in front of it. This is something that exists, so let’s use this as a tool rather than something that we’re going to be afraid of.”
The debate around generative AI “chatbots” like ChatGPT, created by the company OpenAI, has centered around how they can be used for productive purposes or as shortcuts around legitimate research and writing. ChatGPT, for example, can serve as a research tool—or it can write a passable paper that a student could turn in as their own work. Also known as large language models, or LLMs, this cutting-edge technology is also under development by Microsoft and Google, among many others, with endless possible applications. No less an authority than Bill Gates says it “will change our world.”
“The nice thing about this document is that it really strikes a nice balance between the pluses and minuses of something like this when it comes to learning,” says Bestavros, who is also a William Fairfield Warren Distinguished Professor and a computer science professor at the College of Arts & Sciences.
The policy the class wrote is “somewhat embracing” compared to others, Wildman says. It doesn’t ban the technology, because CDS students need to learn to use it—but responsibly.
“I am really excited that BU is not one of those universities that’s like, ‘Nope, we’re gonna block it from our servers, we’re not gonna let you access it, if you access it you’re going to get kicked out,’” says Bene. “I’m very excited that they understand how much power this tool has. It has the capability to do so many things, and if you’re just going to label it as something that’s cheating and bad, you’re doing it a disservice.
“It’s such a powerful technology,” she adds. “And if you’re going to be a research university, you should be one that isn’t afraid of new things that are coming out.”
The policy says students should give credit to LLMs whenever they are used, even if only to generate ideas rather than usable text. And when writing papers or take-home assignments using LLMs, they should include in an appendix their entire exchanges with the LLM, highlighting the most relevant sections and explaining their purpose in using the technology. Students should not use LLMs to help with in-class examinations, tests, or assignments, unless explicitly organized around an LLM.
This is something that exists, so let’s use this as a tool rather than something that we’re going to be afraid of.Olivia Bene (CAS’23)
“We’re looking for responsible ways of setting boundaries around this,” says Mark Crovella, a professor of computer science and of computing and data sciences at CAS and chair of the CDS Academic Policy Committee. “Communicating to students how they’re expected to behave in a world in which it’s possible for us to use these remarkable machine learning tools to do things that look a lot like intellectual work.”
If students use generative AI to do their work for them, “they’re short-circuiting the educational process,” Crovella says. “But, at the same time, the world is never going to  go back to pre-ChatGPT, and we have to understand how to productively coexist with these kinds of tools.”
The policy also provides guidelines for faculty in grading, saying they should treat work submitted by students who don’t use LLMs as the baseline for grading, and use a lower baseline for students who do use them, depending on how extensive the usage.
Faculty should also use AI-generated text detection tools to evaluate the degree to which it is present in student work, the policy says. And faculty should impose a significant penalty for low-energy or unreflective reuse of wording generated by LLMs, to the point of assigning zero points for merely reproducing LLM output.
The policy’s final language is quite close to the original text the students hashed out after a few weeks of class discussions and small-group efforts. It was discussed by the Academic Policy Committee, as well as in many informal conversations, before Bestavros polled the faculty this week.
“I would call it the baseline policy,” Bestavros says, “because different faculty may want to tweak it further, depending on what the courses are about, and to what extent it is a tool versus something that you want to avoid.”
Crovella says it’s “pretty cool” that the students came up with such a workable policy so soon. Wildman says the students are proud of their work—as is he. He’s waiting for students to start asking how to put a project like this in their CVs or refer to it when they’re applying for fellowships or positions.
Wildman will also speak on a panel discussion at Monday’s CDS symposium for BU faculty, staff, graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars: ChatGPT and Other AI Tools: Challenges, Opportunities, and Strategies for Teaching.
“There’s a tremendous amount of confusion both among students and among their teachers, so something needs to be done fast,” Wildman says. “CDS’ responsiveness was partly due to the fact that it is small and new and agile, and also because it wants to be a leader helping the University think through these things.”
Text generation is of course just the beginning for generative AI, which is already roiling fields such as visual art and music. The consensus seems to be that we’ve barely begun to see its ramifications. 
But what Wildman’s students have done is a pretty good start, right? Bestavros is “excited, delighted, proud, you name it,” he says with a grin.

As per the ""Trust in Artificial Intelligence"" study, 42% individuals fear AI will replace jobs in their area of work

Artificial intelligence (AI) has proven helpful to the world in many ways, including the assistants and robots that have taken on many of the tasks associated with daily life and replaced humans in surgical procedures and other professions. Several AI models and tools that are immediately in front of our eyes are ensuring that the world will be a better place, so it's not just the robots that have a beneficial influence on humans, there are models including ChatGPT and Dall-E that have revolutionized the tech industry.For those who may not be aware, ChatGPT is a chatbot that was introduced in November of 2022. It was created to help users with a variety of tasks. Another significant tech company, ""Dell-E,"" is utilized to produce lifelike images only from a description. They were both created by a business named ""OpenAI.""Yet, we are fully aware that it is always bad along with good, therefore to learn more about how people see artificial intelligence, a study titled ""Trust in Artificial Intelligence"" was conducted during September and October 2022. The University of Queensland and KGPM Australia conducted the study and provided the data on which it was based. A total of 17,193 respondents from seventeen different nations participated in the survey.There were three separate sections in the survey's poll: ""agree,"" ""disagree,"" and ""neutral."" Despite everything that has been said about how AI has helped humanity, some individuals still believe that the world would be a far better place without it. 42% of respondents, or two out of every five, agreed with this statement.What may be the cause of it, then? Several individuals are concerned about their occupations and careers being replaced by AI robots that resemble humans as a result of the study. While 39% of individuals polled denied that AI can take over their future, it's likely that they still believe that some jobs couldn't be replaced by it or that they aren't aware of how rapidly AI's value is increasing. The poll also found that 19% of respondents had a neutral opinion on the matter.Nonetheless, each person sees the world from a unique perspective. According to the poll, 67% of respondents remain hopeful and upbeat about the future of AI. Even if they are aware of all the negative effects and how they will affect us, some people (57%) are still relaxed about it.Furthermore, 47% of people report feeling extremely nervous because they fear AI would progressively destroy the human world and that there are very significant risks associated with using AI in daily life, which is not surprising. Also, 24% of them express an angry sentiment against AI and its applications.Read next: TikTok Has Forced Its Competitors To Adopt A Less Lucrative Business Model
