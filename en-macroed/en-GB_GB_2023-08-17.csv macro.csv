The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the job market has brought forth a myriad of concerns and challenges that cannot be overlooked. While AI undeniably offers benefits, its dark side reveals a host of concerns and problems for businesses and individuals alike. As we delve into the darker implications of AI in the job market, it becomes essential to grasp these challenges and navigate the complex landscape of AI, ultimately working towards effective solutions that mitigate potential negative impacts.


Job displacement and automation
Perhaps the most prevalent concern surrounding AI is the potential for widespread job displacement and automation. AI technologies excel at performing routine and repetitive tasks more efficiently than humans, leading to the automation of jobs across various industries. Positions that involve data entry, customer service, and basic analysis are particularly vulnerable. Chatbots and virtual assistants, for example, can handle customer inquiries and support, reducing the need for human involvement. This displacement creates significant challenges for affected individuals, leading to unemployment and income insecurity.

Unequal impact across industries
The impact of AI in the job market is not evenly distributed across industries. While some sectors may experience significant job displacement, others may see minimal disruption or even job growth. Industries that rely heavily on manual labor or routine tasks are particularly vulnerable to AI automation. This imbalance exacerbates the divide between high-skilled and low-skilled workers, contributing to income inequality. Displaced workers often struggle to find suitable alternative employment, further exacerbating the problem.

PROMOTED
Skill requirements and job polarization
The rise of AI in the job market has resulted in a demand for new skill sets. Jobs requiring advanced technological and analytical skills are growing, while low-skilled positions face the risk of obsolescence. This polarization of jobs exacerbates income inequality and presents challenges for individuals without access to education and training opportunities. The need for upskilling and reskilling programs becomes crucial to equip workers with the skills necessary to adapt to the changing job market. However, the availability and accessibility of such programs are limited, leaving many workers at a disadvantage.

Ethical considerations and bias
AI systems are not immune to biases inherent in the data they are trained on. Concerns about bias and discrimination in AI algorithms have been raised, as these systems can inadvertently perpetuate existing societal biases. This has significant implications for hiring practices, where AI-powered resume screening algorithms may inadvertently discriminate against certain groups. Ensuring ethical and unbiased AI systems requires careful testing, evaluation, and ongoing monitoring. Failure to address these concerns can perpetuate social inequalities and reinforce biases in the job market.

Psychological impact on workers
The introduction of AI in the workplace can have profound psychological effects on workers. The fear of job loss, uncertainty about the future, and diminished human interaction can lead to increased stress, anxiety, and job insecurity. Moreover, the devaluation of certain job roles and the emphasis on AI automation can erode workers' sense of purpose and job satisfaction. The psychological well-being of workers affected by AI implementation must be a priority for businesses and policymakers.

The bottom line
While AI brings promising opportunities, it is crucial to acknowledge and address the concerns and problems it poses in the job market. Job displacement, unequal impact across industries, skill polarization, ethical considerations, and the psychological impact on workers are pressing issues that demand attention. The responsible integration of AI requires proactive measures to minimize negative consequences. Businesses, governments, and educational institutions must collaborate to develop comprehensive strategies that prioritize workers' well-being, provide retraining and support programs, and ensure a fair and inclusive job market in the era of AI. Only by navigating these concerns can we strive towards a balanced and sustainable future of work.

The Screen Actors Guild (Sag-Aftra) is concerned with the use of digital likenesses, particularly after Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the guild’s chief negotiator, said studios proposed to pay background actors for a day’s work to use their images in perpetuity. (The AMPTP has disputed this claim as a “mischaracterization”.)‘Bargaining for our very existence’: why the battle over AI is being fought in HollywoodRead moreAll the while, entertainment companies, or tech conglomerates with entertainment divisions, have continued to expand their human staff tasked with the development, research or management of AI. Last month, Netflix made headlines for a job listing for an AI product manager with an annual salary somewhere between $300,000 and $900,000 (according to Sag-Aftra, 87% of the guild’s actors make less than $26,000 a year). A review of Disney’s job board by the Guardian found at least a dozen roles related to machine learning, several of them within its media & entertainment division. Tech companies such as Amazon and Apple have, of course, numerous open machine learning positions, with some specifically tied to entertainment (a Seattle-based AI role for Prime Video Personalization and Discovery offers, according to the listing, “a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to shape the future of TV for billions of viewers worldwide. We know our future success is inextricably tied to being a center of excellence in machine learning science and we invest in it.”).Hollywood’s quiet AI hiring spree, first reported by the Hollywood Reporter and the Los Angeles Times, is not necessarily tied directly to AI-generated scripts or actors’ likenesses, nor are all the positions related to generative AI, the subject of much ethical debate and concern. But taken together, the push to expand AI employment indicates an industry-wide arms race to build up companies’ machine learning capabilities, cutting across many aspects of the business. “All of the studios see the opportunity,” said Dawn Chmielewski, a US entertainment business correspondent at Reuters and the co-author of Binge Times, a book on Hollywood’s streaming wars.“Obviously, cost is a consideration, but also keeping abreast of the pace of technological change. The studios are not unfamiliar with how Silicon Valley can create a technology that suddenly and dramatically changes their business.”Some of these positions build on existing AI capabilities within entertainment companies, which already use machine learning for recommendations, advertising and dubbing of foreign languages. Disney is hiring for US-based machine learning engineers for its recommendation algorithms at Hulu and Disney+; Netflix seeks an applied machine learning scientist for the globalization team ($150,000 to $700,000) to “develop algorithms that power high quality localization at scale” and “shape the future of localization and global entertainment at Netflix”.Sony has open roles for use of AI in video games and machine learning audio processing for, among other things, post production of music and movies, as well as ethics-related roles such as AI ethics technical program manager and AI privacy and security project manager. (All roles are part of Tokyo-based Sony Group, which includes Sony Pictures Entertainment and opened its own AI ethics office in 2021.)View image in fullscreenA striking actor outside Netflix’s Los Angeles office. Photograph: ShutterstockIt’s difficult to ascertain the scope of each role, and its potential impact on the entertainment business, from the outside (through a spokesman, Netflix declined to comment this article; Disney, Sony and Amazon could not be reached for comment). But the picture of current investment in AI by entertainment companies is slowly coming into view.“Generally speaking, there’s a lot of fear of missing out that’s really sweeping the industry,” said Ben Zhao, a professor of computer science at the University of Chicago. Industry executives “are not necessarily sure about what it is that they want” as “companies are still trying to figure out their AI strategy”.The hiring boom goes beyond entertainment; nationwide, companies are procuring “head of AI” leadership positions with vague mandates in an effort to get ahead of the curve, or out of fear of being left behind; the number of people in AI leadership roles in the US has grown threefold in the past five years, according to data from LinkedIn. “We are all going to be touched by this technology,” said Chmielewski. “And the studios certainly see an imperative to embrace it or risk obsolescence.”For entertainment companies, the AI hiring boom reflects “a combination of trying to find people with the business acumen to understand what the market needs, what they can do with current AI, and how they can best leverage advancements in AI, particularly generative AI”, said Zhao.Disney, in particular, is making a concerted push toward AI, framed as part of the company’s long tradition of embracing new technology or as part of an inevitable march of progress. (Disney Studios in Burbank, for example, has listed a job for a senior machine learning engineer to “shape the next generation of creative and production technology and directly help drive innovation across our cinematic pipelines and theatrical experiences”.)The company recently formed an internal taskforce to study AI and examine how it could be used across divisions, and the chief executive, Bob Iger, has indicated that the company sees AI, including generative AI, as a clear part of its creative future. “Nothing is going to stop technological advancement,” Iger said at a company town hall last November. Generative AI technology, he added, is “something that at some point in the future the company will embrace”.“In fact, we’re already starting to use AI to create some efficiencies and ultimately to better serve consumers,” Iger said during an earnings call this July, as reported by journalist Lee Fang. Asked about the framing of AI as inevitable, Zhao pointed out that “AI is being touted as an efficiency improver. It’s worthwhile to think about the ultimate result of that efficiency” – namely the prospect of lost human jobs.Joan Is Awful: Black Mirror episode is every striking actor’s worst nightmareRead moreGenerative AI is, indeed, already shaping the things we watch. It’s used in visual effects, to help with dubbing for Netflix’s many foreign language shows, or to produce a small version of a real rival soccer coach for games in Apple’s Ted Lasso, or to create a full younger version of Will Smith in Paramount’s 2019 film Gemini Man. Disney-owned Marvel Studios controversially used AI to generate the opening credits for its recent series Secret Invasion.In July, Netflix premiered a new Spanish reality dating series, Deep Fake Love, in which scans of contestants’ faces and bodies are used to create “deepfake” simulations of themselves. The company’s gaming department has used AI to produce narratives and dialogue. In the documentary world, film-makers have used generative AI to recreate the voices of the late Anthony Bourdain and Andy Warhol to bridge archival gaps, and to create “digital veils” – fake faces – to protect interview subjects in Welcome to Chechnya, a documentary on the Russian government’s persecution of LGBTQ+ people.View image in fullscreenAnnie Murphy in Black Mirror. Photograph: NetflixFor now, the major fears of writers and actors – the kind depicted in the Black Mirror episode Joan Is Awful, in which a Netflix stand-in streaming service airs an entirely AI-created show – are not yet realized. But from a capability standpoint, “writers and actors could both be replaced by AI in the near future, along with everyone who works to create a movie using real human actors. We could see entire movies generated by AI without any human involvement,” said David Krueger, a researcher with the University of Cambridge’s Machine Learning Group.“This probably won’t happen in the next few years, but could easily happen within the decade.”This possibility has underscored actors’ and writers’ demands for protections over AI, from what creative material (performances, text) can be used to train models to protections against AI-generated scripts. The AMPTP has released several public statements on the matter of AI, which “raises hard, important creative and legal questions for everyone” that “requires a lot more discussion, which we’ve committed to doing” and noting that according to the current agreement with the WGA, AI-generated material would not be eligible for credit as “only a ‘person’ can be considered a writer”.“We are still in the early stages,” said Zhao. “There is so much hype that dominates conversations. And it is very difficult to see facts from the hype” – particularly on the capability and risks of generative AI. It remains unclear what the limits on those will be. But the race for AI in a post-strike Hollywood is already under way.Explore more on these topicsFilm industryNetflixUS actors' strike 2023US writers' strike 2023featuresShareReuse this contentMost viewed‘We pledged not to eat each other’: the family that was shipwrecked for 38 daysRunning Kamala Harris may actually be a political masterstroke for the DemocratsSteve Phillips‘A wise investment’: Trump’s $6,000 gift to Kamala Harris comes back to bite himBody-cam video shows Illinois officer fatally shooting Black woman in faceNursing home owner who left 800 people in warehouse during Hurricane Ida avoids jail time",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How many HR managers acknowledged Artificial Intelligence Appreciation Day on 16 July? It probably passed unnoticed by most, considering the ever-growing list of tasks demanding the profession’s attention.
Even if they did have a minute to look up from their work and appreciate the power of this fast-developing technology, is there any reason to celebrate something that’s likely to put millions of people out of a job? 
‘Yes’ should be the answer to that question. AI’s ability to automate certain tasks and reduce administrative workloads promises to make the HR practitioner’s role more human. Embracing AI should free professionals in this space to devote more time and energy to identifying talent and nurturing it, which is why most people enter the field in the first place. And, with more and better information at its fingertips, the function could play a more holistic and strategically important role.
But have HR teams become too overloaded with extra work to take this great opportunity? 
How HR’s role has expanded
During the Covid crisis, HR teams were “mostly in survival mode”, says Dr Aaron Taylor, head of Arden University’s School of Human Resource Management. “As well as figuring out how employees could work from home, they needed to provide extra support for their mental and physical wellbeing while adhering to health guidelines.”
Progressive organisations will start to broaden how they use generative AI and it will benefit both employees and HR teams
He points out that, thanks to shifting workforce trends, many HR leaders were involved in C-level decisions to keep companies functioning, as well as to handle restructuring operations and redundancy programmes. 
“The profession’s evolution over the past 25 years – from ‘pay and rations’ to the strategic role it plays today – has, quite possibly, been more radical than that of any other business function,” Taylor argues.
Eric Mosley, co-founder and CEO of HR software firm Workhuman, agrees that HR has gone through “a very hectic, chaotic time. There’s been a complete whiplash, with trends veering from one direction to another.” 
Outlining the chaotic nature of the Covid era, Mosley points to remote working, back-to-office mandates, quiet quitting, loud quitting, the great resignation and, as economic uncertainty prevails, the so-called big stay.
AI’s part in the future of HR
Helen Poitevin is a distinguished vice-president and analyst focusing on HR tech at research giant Gartner. She says that “a debate is raging about the future of work between ‘explorers’, who embrace new tech and ways of working, and ‘restorers’, who believe companies should be using tried and tested methods. AI has emerged as one of the disruptive technologies at the heart of this conversation.”
Poitevin reports that AI is already playing a role in HR operations ranging from policy-making to recruitment. A global survey of HR leaders published by Gartner in July indicates that 5% have implemented generative AI, for instance, while 9% are piloting its use. 
“In the future, progressive organisations will start to broaden how they use generative AI. It will benefit both employees and HR teams,” she predicts. “A quarter of HR leaders are planning to use it to create hyper-personalised career development plans, for instance.”
Poitevin adds that HR professionals can, when equipped with the right tech, “better understand employees and so provide more human advice” that’s better tailored to each person’s needs. 
Taylor agrees that the profession has been placing greater emphasis on understanding employees as people. “There is much more importance on the ‘human’ aspects of HR now, especially when looking at employee experience,” he says. “This is no longer solely about ensuring regulatory compliance. This is about going that extra mile to know what makes employees tick and how that aligns with the company’s overall strategy.”
Skills development and career progression
While it’s never exactly been strong, the quality of communications between HR and the shop floor has worsened in recent years. New research by data science consultancy Profusion indicates that only 24% of employees are “fully comfortable” discussing workplace problems with the HR team, for example. 
Profusion’s CEO, Natalie Cramp, notes that the pandemic-induced shift towards remote working has “severely hampered the relationship between workers and their HR representatives, eroding any sense of trust and understanding”. 
This is about going that extra mile to know what makes employees tick and how that aligns with the company’s overall strategy
A study published in May by Microsoft, which has invested heavily in generative AI, argues that HR practitioners who understand the technology and use it well will become better communicators with the power to improve the employee experience. 
“Human-AI collaboration will be the next transformational work pattern,” the research report predicts, proposing the notion of using AI as a “co-pilot”. 
How would such co-piloting work in practice? Take the use of so-called writer’s block AI to improve communications between HR and the workforce, for instance. This technology uses relevant information about the company and its employees to personalise messages and deliver these in the appropriate tone.
An HR team can work alongside AI to map out possible career paths for people in the organisation. For instance, the technology might spot hidden potential in an employee who’s been flying under the radar and prompt the team to alert that individual to an appealing internal role that would suit their talents and offer them a valuable development opportunity.
AI can enable better employee recognition
AI can also aid employee recognition – a wellbeing-boosting intervention that can be as simple as thanking someone publicly, yet is lacking in many workplaces. LinkedIn has reported achieving a 96% retention rate among employees whose work was acknowledged at least four times a year. With the prompting of AI, HR teams can recognise and celebrate the contributions (or life events) of employees or ask their line managers to do so.
“Recognition is an authentic, honest moment, where someone expresses genuine gratitude for another’s work,” Mosley says. “That connection can build relationships and community.” 
He stresses that recognition has the greatest impact when it is “fulfilled, authentic, embedded in the culture, individualised and equitable”. Again, AI tools can help HR practitioners with all of this, enabling them to convey heartfelt messages of encouragement when it matters to the recipients.
Research by Workhuman suggests that giving recognition is mutually beneficial. Managers who have done so in the past two months are more likely than those who haven’t to love their jobs (75% versus 48%) and identify as highly engaged (89% versus 64%).
Building on this last data point, Gallup’s most recent State of the Global Workplace report pegged employee engagement at about 23% last year. Given that this was the highest recorded percentage since the company started gathering such data in 2009, there is clearly significant room for improvement. 
Now, thanks to AI, HR teams have no excuse not to be more human in the digital era, recognise the good work of others and gain job satisfaction in the process.

Forty percent of data analysis leaders currently use generative artificial intelligence in their work, including to write code, analytics platform company Alteryx found in a report released August 15. Alteryx surveyed 300 data leaders across four countries — Australia, the U.K., the U.S. and Canada — about their use of generative artificial intelligence, qualms around its use and more.

A little over half of businesses have experimented with AI
CEOs often drive AI adoption
Tech leaders have qualms about generative AI
Organizations are still discovering how generative AI may benefit them

A little over half of businesses have experimented with AI
Surveyed companies using generative AI employed it in content generation (46%), analytics insights summary (43%), analytics insights generation (32%), code development (31%) and process documentation (27%).
Most companies surveyed are curious about AI but don’t use it as part of their everyday process. The majority, 53%, said they are “exploring” or “experimenting” with the technology. Only 13% have AI models in place already and are working on optimizing them. In the middle sits the 34% who are “formalizing,” moving from pilot programs to production on a generative AI solution.

Of those who do use generative AI in any capacity, most found a positive impact: 55% reported modest benefits, and 34% reported substantial benefits. The benefits they found included increased market competitiveness (52%), improved security (49%) and enhanced performance or functionality of their products (45%). Another 10% found they didn’t benefit at all, and 1% found it too early to say.

Often, it takes only one business leader to adopt generative AI as their pet project and encourage the rest of the company to adopt it. In 98% of cases, organizations report that a single person in a leadership position drove their generative AI strategy. In most cases, that leader was the CEO (30%), with slightly fewer organizations following the directives of a head of IT (25%) or chief data or analytics officer (22%). Conversely, among companies not using generative AI, 35% said they had “no one to take the lead with implementation.”
Interestingly, there is an element of hobbyist enthusiasm to the business adoption of generative AI. According to the survey, 81% of people who use generative AI at work also use it for personal or recreational purposes outside of work.
Tech leaders have qualms about generative AI
Many companies still have concerns about the security, copyright rules or efficacy of generative AI. Organizations that haven’t implemented generative AI said they didn’t do so because of concerns about data privacy (47%), lack of trust in the results produced by the system (43%), lack of sufficient expertise (39%) and not having anyone on staff to take the lead on implementing generative AI (34%).
Of the organizations already using generative AI in their work, the most pressing concerns were data ownership (29%), data privacy (28%) and IP ownership (28%).
One way to solve some of these concerns is human oversight — 64% said they believe generative AI can be used now as long as a human has veto power over the output. And there is a high degree of trust among workers who already use generative AI; 70% think it can “deliver initial, rapid results that I can review and modify to completion.”

Others — 71% — agreed to the idea that risks around generative AI can be managed by using the technology within frameworks set up by trusted software vendors.
Whether generative AI will replace roles for human workers is complicated. There’s an impression among 77% of surveyed people who already use generative AI that it could replace entire roles.
Other risks include privacy concerns, novel security vulnerabilities and copyright infringement when AI models are trained on original work. One possible solution is working within fair use principles, Asa Whillock, vice president and general manager of machine learning at Alteryx, pointed out in an email to TechRepublic: “Leaders must understand, however, that the trust of AI and LLMs is reliant on the quality of data inputs. Insights that are generated by AI models are only as good as the data they have access to,” Whillock said.
Organizations are still discovering how generative AI may benefit them
“Though the pulse survey indicates that many companies are still in the nascent stages of adoption, there’s a growing awareness of the benefits, and early adopters are already reaping the rewards,” wrote Heather Ferguson, Alteryx editorial manager, in a blog post.
“If implemented strategically, generative AI provides a massive opportunity for data democratization that will positively impact business operations, decisions and outcomes due to the cases for integrating LLMs (large language models) responsibly with low-code/no-code,” said Whillock.

The media frenzy surrounding ChatGPT and other large language model artificial intelligence systems spans a range of themes, from the prosaic – large language models could replace conventional web search – to the concerning – AI will eliminate many jobs – and the overwrought – AI poses an extinction-level threat to humanity. All of these themes have a common denominator: large language models herald artificial intelligence that will supersede humanity.
But large language models, for all their complexity, are actually really dumb. And despite the name “artificial intelligence,” they’re completely dependent on human knowledge and labor. They can’t reliably generate new knowledge, of course, but there’s more to it than that. 
ChatGPT can’t learn, improve or even stay up to date without humans giving it new content and telling it how to interpret that content, not to mention programming the model and building, maintaining and powering its hardware. To understand why, you first have to understand how ChatGPT and similar models work, and the role humans play in making them work.
How ChatGPT works
Large language models like ChatGPT work, broadly, by predicting what characters, words and sentences should follow one another in sequence based on training data sets. In the case of ChatGPT, the training data set contains immense quantities of public text scraped from the internet. 


ChatGPT works by statistics, not by understanding words.

Imagine I trained a language model on the following set of sentences:
Bears are large, furry animals.
Bears have claws.
Bears are secretly robots.
Bears have noses.
Bears are secretly robots.
Bears sometimes eat fish.
Bears are secretly robots.
The model would be more inclined to tell me that bears are secretly robots than anything else, because that sequence of words appears most frequently in its training data set. This is obviously a problem for models trained on fallible and inconsistent data sets – which is all of them, even academic literature. 
People write lots of different things about quantum physics, Joe Biden, healthy eating or the Jan. 6 insurrection, some more valid than others. How is the model supposed to know what to say about something, when people say lots of different things?
The need for feedback
This is where feedback comes in. If you use ChatGPT, you’ll notice that you have the option to rate responses as good or bad. If you rate them as bad, you’ll be asked to provide an example of what a good answer would contain. ChatGPT and other large language models learn what answers, what predicted sequences of text, are good and bad through feedback from users, the development team and contractors hired to label the output.
ChatGPT cannot compare, analyze or evaluate arguments or information on its own. It can only generate sequences of text similar to those that other people have used when comparing, analyzing or evaluating, preferring ones similar to those it has been told are good answers in the past.
Thus, when the model gives you a good answer, it’s drawing on a large amount of human labor that’s already gone into telling it what is and isn’t a good answer. There are many, many human workers hidden behind the screen, and they will always be needed if the model is to continue improving or to expand its content coverage. 
A recent investigation published by journalists in Time magazine revealed that hundreds of Kenyan workers spent thousands of hours reading and labeling racist, sexist and disturbing writing, including graphic descriptions of sexual violence, from the darkest depths of the internet to teach ChatGPT not to copy such content. They were paid no more than US$2 an hour, and many understandably reported experiencing psychological distress due to this work.


Language AIs require humans to tell them what makes a good answer – and what makes toxic content.

What ChatGPT can’t do
The importance of feedback can be seen directly in ChatGPT’s tendency to “hallucinate”; that is, confidently provide inaccurate answers. ChatGPT can’t give good answers on a topic without training, even if good information about that topic is widely available on the internet. You can try this out yourself by asking ChatGPT about more and less obscure things. I’ve found it particularly effective to ask ChatGPT to summarize the plots of different fictional works because, it seems, the model has been more rigorously trained on nonfiction than fiction. 
In my own testing, ChatGPT summarized the plot of J.R.R. Tolkien’s “The Lord of the Rings,” a very famous novel, with only a few mistakes. But its summaries of Gilbert and Sullivan’s “The Pirates of Penzance” and of Ursula K. Le Guin’s “The Left Hand of Darkness” – both slightly more niche but far from obscure – come close to playing Mad Libs with the character and place names. It doesn’t matter how good these works’ respective Wikipedia pages are. The model needs feedback, not just content.
Because large language models don’t actually understand or evaluate information, they depend on humans to do it for them. They are parasitic on human knowledge and labor. When new sources are added into their training data sets, they need new training on whether and how to build sentences based on those sources. 
They can’t evaluate whether news reports are accurate or not. They can’t assess arguments or weigh trade-offs. They can’t even read an encyclopedia page and only make statements consistent with it, or accurately summarize the plot of a movie. They rely on human beings to do all these things for them. 
Then they paraphrase and remix what humans have said, and rely on yet more human beings to tell them whether they’ve paraphrased and remixed well. If the common wisdom on some topic changes – for example, whether salt is bad for your heart or whether early breast cancer screenings are useful – they will need to be extensively retrained to incorporate the new consensus.
Many people behind the curtain
In short, far from being the harbingers of totally independent AI, large language models illustrate the total dependence of many AI systems, not only on their designers and maintainers but on their users. So if ChatGPT gives you a good or useful answer about something, remember to thank the thousands or millions of hidden people who wrote the words it crunched and who taught it what were good and bad answers. 
Far from being an autonomous superintelligence, ChatGPT is, like all technologies, nothing without us.

Of course we’re going to talk about generative AI at CIO’s Future of Work Summit, a virtual event taking place September 20.
With the promise of generative AI, we’re living through what many believe to be a seismic change in how we work – and who works with and for us.
But that’s not all we’ll talk about. The conference’s theme is Automation and Augmentation: Building a Next-Gen Workforce. We promise to bring insights and examples from multiple industries to help you guide what that future looks like for you.
 
 
 













 
 

Our conference team has updated sessions to reflect new innovations and practices that have developed since we originally began planning the event. And we will continue to adapt our content until we go live on September 20.

Still, common themes have started to emerge. Here are three things to watch out for:
The future is here.
 
 
 













 
 

Companies have already started to adjust their org charts, job descriptions, and titles to adapt to the dawn of the age of AI. Justin Martinez, practice leader in the executive search firm Korn Ferry’s Technology Officers Practice, will share changes in how and what companies are hiring for now.
What’s next? Futurist Samantha Radocchia will make sense of the changes to tell us what’s next in the near term, whether that’s what it will be like for people to collaborate with autonomous colleagues or how to embrace these transformations without being left behind. She will also answer your questions in a live discussion.
It’s not all about generative AI.
 
 
 













 
 

IT leaders are going beyond the chatbot to achieve greater productivity and innovation. Mark Austin, vice president of data science at AT&T, will talk about the company’s highly successful intelligent automation initiatives with CIO Senior Writer Thor Olavsrud.
Don’t sleep on security.
While CISOs and CIOs have had to grapple with shadow IT for years, they now have to contend with shadow AI as employees experiment on their own with ChatGPT and other technologies. Learn from a panel of CIOs and analysts on how to maintain control of these exciting – yet dangerous – tools. (Anyone interested in a deeper dive into security’s role in AI should join us in person at the CSO50 Conference + Awards in October.)

Optimizing human and AI workMercer

Even by the relatively lofty standards of the tech sector, the hype around generative AI may have broken new ground. McKinsey estimate that the technology could add between $2.6tn to $4.4tn of economic value annually across industries ranging from banking to life sciences. Chat GPT, probably the most well known example of generative AI, reached 100 million users 2 months after launch and by most estimates has over 1 billion users currently. The following analysis based on multiple recent studies and a framework for analyzing the impact of automation on work as described in Reinventing Jobs (HBR Press, 2018), illustrates the potentially significant gains possible through the use of RPA and the four generations of AI currently available to us (rule-based systems, machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI).

But how exactly will generative AI affect work? Answering this question requires an understanding of the differences between generative AI and the previous generations of AI. The following analysis1 illustrates the most significant differences

While earlier iterations of AI were helpful in predicting specific outcomes, the lack of reasoning that underpins generative AI means that its well documented hallucinations will remain a feature of the technology for the foreseeable future. To understand how best to use it requires us to understand the essential characteristics of work. As described in Reinventing Jobs, there are four distinct potential outcomes associated with any body of work:

Error elimination — think of some of the work of an airline pilot — where the consequences of a mistake are high and there is significant potential for negative value to the organization from any deviation from an acceptable level of performance.
Minimizing variance — such as transaction-processing work — where there is no value in improving performance beyond a target level.
Improving productivity — the work of a salesperson, for example — where an improvement in performance yields a commensurate improvement in value to the organization.
Achieving breakthroughs — think of highly creative work, such as data science — where a small improvement in performance has an exponentially large impact on value.

Established automation like Robotic Process Automation (RPA) can be helpful in substituting human endeavor in work where the objective is to reduce variance and there is a greater tolerance for risk. Consider the application of RPA to reduce the variance with which the highly repetitive, rules-based work of analyzing and synthesizing financial data is performed. Previous generations of AI have long been used to augment analytical work where productivity improvement or achieving a breakthrough is the goal. Consider how oncologists have used machine learning, trained on significant volumes of specific data and images, to exponentially increase the accuracy of cancer detection, not by replacing skills but by augmenting capabilities and increasing the premium on experience and expertise. However, when error elimination is the objective function for work, generative AI can be an extremely risk proposition. Its aforementioned hallucinations place an extremely high premium on human competency and care, reducing its value proposition significantly.
It is essential that leaders understand when to rely on — and when not to rely on — various technologies and the specific role they should have in either substituting, augmenting of transforming human work. Generative AI is most useful in democratizing knowledge and creativity through augmentation, lowering the skills premiums traditionally required for a variety of creative tasks where the goal is achieving productivity gains and seeking a breakthrough in domains where there is a high tolerance for risk. It can be a valuable tool for boosting productivity where the tolerance for risk is higher. Compelling use cases have ranged from copywriting to call center operations where it has demonstrated significant value in boosting productivity particularly for the least experienced talent.
Interestingly, this democratization of access could have the benefit of reducing the rising inequality we have experienced over the last 2 industrial revolutions as generative AI increases the productivity of talent with lesser skills, much as the automation of the second-industrial revolution did. As AI continues to lower the premium on creativity and democratizes access, how will you ensure the perpetual reinvention of your business model and workforce to take advantage of it in a thoughtful and nuanced way?

There’s also a course on the responsible usage of AI.Although there’s no official qualification, you will be awarded a completion badge that you can attach to your digital resume. Google has also recently expanded its paid certificates program which can be accessed through Coursera and has made its free courses available in 18 additional languages.2. Microsoft’s “Transform Your Business With AI” courseThis Microsoft learning path is designed, as the tech giant says, to help businesspeople acquire “the knowledge and resources to adopt AI in their organizations”, and explores “planning, strategizing, and scaling AI projects in a responsible way.”Microsoft says the objectives for this course are to become familiar with existing AI tools, understand basic AI terminology and practices, and use prebuilt AI to build intelligent applications.To enroll in this course, which is 2 hours and 40 minutes long, Microsoft says you’ll need a “basic understanding” of IT and business concepts. Modules included in the pathway are:Leverage AI tools and resources for your business (55 mins)Create business value from AI (21 min)Embrace responsible AI principles and practices (48 mins)Scale AI in your organization (36 mins)3. Google’s “Machine Learning Foundational Course”Along with the foundational AI course mentioned above, Google also provides an introductory course on machine learning that’s available for free. You can access the course with your Google Workspace or personal account, and there’s actually a surprising amount of material included, considering it’s free.Included as part of the material is a “crash course” to machine learning, a section on “problem framing” and a course on how to prepare your data for machine learning workflows. Included are freely accessible videos explaining core concepts, provided by machine learning experts. You’ll then be able to “check your understanding” at the end of each section with a quiz.While this course is a little more advanced than the other Google course to make this list – and has a bit more of a business focus – it’s worth checking out if your company is looking for new ways to implement AI/machine learning in the workplace.4. LinkedIn’s “Career Essentials In Generative AI” training courseLinkedIn’s AI Career Essentials Course is made up of five different videos, with a total run time of around four hours. Each video is hosted by a different AI expert, covering a range of core concepts and ethical considerations relating to AI models.One of the videos provides a detailed explanation of how to streamline your work with Microsoft Bing Chat, while another discusses the key differences between search engines and reasoning engines. Although there’s no accreditation or certification, completing this course will earn you a badge of completion from LinkedIn, which can be displayed on your profile.The fifth video in the series, entitled “an Introduction to Artificial Intelligence” is an hour and a half long and provides a simplified overview of the best AI tools for businesses, which is handy for those who haven’t taken the plunge yet and implemented a tool in work.5. IBM’s “AI Foundations for Everyone” training courseIBM offers a course entitled “AI Foundations for Everyone” through Coursera, of which over 2,000 people have already signed up for in just February 2024. You can audit the course for free, which will give you access to all of the materials and some of the assignments, but you won’t be graded or get a certificate at the end. For that, you’ll need a Coursera subscription.It’s geared toward beginners and you don’t need prior experience to enroll, and the schedule is flexible so you can learn at your own pace. Along with AI fundamentals, the course will also ensure you’re familiar with IBM’s own AI services, which help businesses integrate artificial intelligence into their existing infrastructure.IBM says that, by the end of the course, participants will have had “hands-on interactions with several AI environments and applications”.The course has three modules: “Introduction to Artificial Intelligence”, “Getting Started with AI using IBM Watson”, and “Building AI-Powered Chatbots Without Programming”. Each module takes between nine and eleven hours to complete.6. Digital Partner’s “The Fundamentals of ChatGPT” training courseDigital Partner’s course entitled “The fundamentals of ChatGPT” is a great option for anyone who wants to take a free, accredited course that covers the basics of Generative AI. As of February 2024, more than 8,000 learners have completed the short course.During the course, you’ll spend time learning about OpenAI’s role in global AI development, and be able to learn about how ChatGPT works, its advantages and limitations. There’s also a variety of examples included within the course that will show you how to leverage ChatGPT for different tasks, and you’ll learn more about the difference between ChatGPT and ChatGPT Plus.Modules include “Working With ChatGPT”, “ChatGPT and Its Shortcomings” and “Training a GPT Model”. This free course is available on alison.com, and is published by a digital marketing firm called Digital Partner. The course is CPD accredited and a certificate will be awarded upon completion of a small assessment at the end of the 1.5-3 hour program.7. DeepLearning.AI’s “AI for Everyone” (Coursera)Not to be confused with IBM’s similarly-named online AI training course, DeepLearning.AI’s “AI for Everyone” short course is worth enrolling in just to see what the fuss is all about. 1.2 million people have enrolled in this course and more than 40,000 have reviewed it, with an average score of 4,8/5 in February 2024 – perhaps because it’s run by lecturer Andrew Ng, an instructor with over 40 courses published on the site.This course is split up into four broad modules: What Is AI?, Building AI Projects, Building AI in Your Company, and AI in Society. All four of the modules take less than an hour to complete, so you could feasibly complete the course in a day if you’re prepared to take the quizzes designed to recap each module.Like most Coursera courses, you’ll be able to audit the course and access all the materials for free, although you’ll have to sign up for a paid account if you want the relevant accreditation once you complete the course.8. Phil Ebner’s ChatGPT, Midjourney, Firefly, Bard, DALL-E” AI crash courseWhile some good courses on Udemy will guide you through the ins and outs of MidJourney and other AI generation tools, Phil Ebner covers the most ground, and more than 30,000 students have already enrolled in the course, which has a 4.6/5 rating on Udemy.The course is almost two hours long and also includes content that will help you better use tools like ChatGPT to generate text responses as well as images.The “AI for Visual Creativity” section, however, will show you how to use both MidJourney and Dall-E to create “photorealistic images, illustrations, and digital art in a variety of styles. With OpenAI’s Sora video generator seemingly just around the corner, there’s never been a better time to learn the basic principles of AI video generation and the tools that can do it.On Udemy, you don’t receive certificates of completion for free courses, but if you’re just looking to upskill yourself free of charge, this course is definitely worth a look.

The Benefits of Learning About AIOf course, completing an AI training course can have several benefits. From a personal learning perspective, it’s one of the best ways you can spend your time – AI is here to stay, and getting a better grasp of how it works might just help you out in the near future.Plus, the things you learn about AI will be applicable to a wide variety of job roles in almost every sector of the economy, so it’s arguably a safer bet than completing a course on a niche or industry-specific topic.What’s more, right now, businesses are looking for people who understand how generative AI tools like ChatGPT work, and how to leverage them effectively. Employees that are conscious of the limitations of AI tools and able to generate useful responses using prompts are going to become more sought after than employees without these skills.Completing an AI training course is going to look good on your CV, which will help if you’re applying for a new job. Evidence that you’ve taken the initiative to explore an emerging technology is definitely something an employer will find desirable.Of course, if you don’t have much of a budget – or you’re not entirely sure what AI training course would be the best use of your time – then trying out some free options is a great place to start.The Benefits of Developing Your Soft Skills in an Automated WorldIf you’re looking for AI training courses to enhance your understanding of something that’s going to dominate the business world for years to come, you’re already one step ahead of the crowd.Completing an AI course isn’t the only way to prepare yourself for the seismic changes to the global economy that will occur as AI is harnessed by more businesses.One other thing you can do if you want to upskill yourself is to develop your soft skills. These are the “human” skills that AI tools like ChatGPT don’t have. Businesses are always going to need humans to organize, prioritize, and take responsibility for planning and executing projects.With AI taking control of more and more repetitive administrative tasks, having strong soft skills is going to be increasingly important to stand out in a pool of highly-qualified job applicants or colleagues jostling for promotion.Developing your soft skills can consist of taking an accredited course – but they are more than often improved by taking experiences, especially in the workplace. It’s vital, then, to put yourself forward for opportunities and experiences that will let you expand your communication, organization, and general leadership skills. You can be taught to work a piece of software in a week, but you can’t click your fingers and make someone a proficient public speaker or project manager. FAQs    Is Google's AI certification free?     Yes – Google has a free AI learning path that has ten courses you can complete for free. Each course takes around one day to complete. The modules provide an introduction to generative AI, and although there’s no official qualification, you will get a completion badge which you can add to your resume.       How do I AI proof my job?     AI proofing your job can be done in two ways. Firstly, make sure you’re competent at using the latest generative AI tools like ChatGPT. This is especially vital if many of the tasks you’re completing on a day-to-day basis could, in theory, be completed by AI. Secondly, ensure you’re investing in the development of soft skills that AI tools may never have, such as the ability to effectively and appropriately manage employees.       Can I learn AI on my own?     Yes – you can learn how to harness the powers of AI on your own, through online guides, tutorials, and courses. There are quite a lot of resources out there now that will show you how to get the most out of generative AI tools like ChatGPT. However, if you want to learn how more complex skills, such as programming a large language model, you may need to seek out a paid course       Is Microsoft's AI course free?     Yes – Microsoft has a free training path available that consists of four short modules, which cover how to leverage AI effectively in business settings and how to scale AI projects in a responsible, impactful way.

The MIT Stephen A. Schwarzman College of Computing has awarded seed grants to seven projects that are exploring how artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction can be leveraged to enhance modern work spaces to achieve better management and higher productivity.
Funded by Andrew W. Houston ’05 and Dropbox Inc., the projects are intended to be interdisciplinary and bring together researchers from computing, social sciences, and management.
The seed grants can enable the project teams to conduct research that leads to bigger endeavors in this rapidly evolving area, as well as build community around questions related to AI-augmented management.
The seven selected projects and research leads include:
“LLMex: Implementing Vannevar Bush’s Vision of the Memex Using Large Language Models,” led by Pattie Maes of the Media Lab and David Karger of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) and the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). Inspired by Vannevar Bush’s Memex, this project proposes to design, implement, and test the concept of memory prosthetics using large language models (LLMs). The AI-based system will intelligently help an individual keep track of vast amounts of information, accelerate productivity, and reduce errors by automatically recording their work actions and meetings, supporting retrieval based on metadata and vague descriptions, and suggesting relevant, personalized information proactively based on the user’s current focus and context.
“Using AI Agents to Simulate Social Scenarios,” led by John Horton of the MIT Sloan School of Management and Jacob Andreas of EECS and CSAIL. This project imagines the ability to easily simulate policies, organizational arrangements, and communication tools with AI agents before implementation. Tapping into the capabilities of modern LLMs to serve as a computational model of humans makes this vision of social simulation more realistic, and potentially more predictive.
“Human Expertise in the Age of AI: Can We Have Our Cake and Eat it Too?” led by Manish Raghavan of MIT Sloan and EECS, and Devavrat Shah of EECS and the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems. Progress in machine learning, AI, and in algorithmic decision aids has raised the prospect that algorithms may complement human decision-making in a wide variety of settings. Rather than replacing human professionals, this project sees a future where AI and algorithmic decision aids play a role that is complementary to human expertise.
“Implementing Generative AI in U.S. Hospitals,” led by Julie Shah of the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics and CSAIL, Retsef Levi of MIT Sloan and the Operations Research Center, Kate Kellog of MIT Sloan, and Ben Armstrong of the Industrial Performance Center. In recent years, studies have linked a rise in burnout from doctors and nurses in the United States with increased administrative burdens associated with electronic health records and other technologies. This project aims to develop a holistic framework to study how generative AI technologies can both increase productivity for organizations and improve job quality for workers in health care settings.
“Generative AI Augmented Software Tools to Democratize Programming,” led by Harold Abelson of EECS and CSAIL, Cynthia Breazeal of the Media Lab, and Eric Klopfer of the Comparative Media Studies/Writing. Progress in generative AI over the past year is fomenting an upheaval in assumptions about future careers in software and deprecating the role of coding. This project will stimulate a similar transformation in computing education for those who have no prior technical training by creating a software tool that could eliminate much of the need for learners to deal with code when creating applications.
“Acquiring Expertise and Societal Productivity in a World of Artificial Intelligence,” led by David Atkin and Martin Beraja of the Department of Economics, and Danielle Li of MIT Sloan. Generative AI is thought to augment the capabilities of workers performing cognitive tasks. This project seeks to better understand how the arrival of AI technologies may impact skill acquisition and productivity, and to explore complementary policy interventions that will allow society to maximize the gains from such technologies.
“AI Augmented Onboarding and Support,” led by Tim Kraska of EECS and CSAIL, and Christoph Paus of the Department of Physics and the Laboratory for Nuclear Science. While LLMs have made enormous leaps forward in recent years and are poised to fundamentally change the way students and professionals learn about new tools and systems, there is often a steep learning curve which people have to climb in order to make full use of the resource. To help mitigate the issue, this project proposes the development of new LLM-powered onboarding and support systems that will positively impact the way support teams operate and improve the user experience.

It was in the computer game Neuromancer, programmed by Troy Miles and based on William Gibson’s cyberpunk novel. Other people may have first encountered HAL 9000 from Stanley Kubrik’s 2001: A Space Odyssey or Samantha from Spike Jonze’s Her.AI companies aren’t afraid of regulation – we want it to be international and inclusiveDorothy ChouRead moreImages from pop culture influence people’s impressions of AI, but culture has an even more profound relationship to it. If there’s one thing to take away from this article, it is the idea that AI systems are not objective machines, but instead based in human culture: our values, norms, preferences, and behaviours in society. These aspects of our culture are reflected in how systems are engineered. So instead of trying to decide whether AI systems are objectively good or bad for society, we need to design them to reflect the ethically positive culture we truly want.Here’s an example: Roger Dannenberg, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, has created an AI system that plays music with people. It accompanies performers based on ideas of pitch, scale, tempo and so on, that could be called facets of western music theory. In contrast, the composer and scholar George E Lewis, coming from a tradition based in the African diaspora – jazz and other traditions, as nurtured by Chicago’s Association for Advancement of Creative Music – has created a system called Voyager that is a “nonhierarchical, interactive musical environment that privileges improvisation”. The outcomes are very different. Dannenberg’s system produces output that is effective at following a conventional performer – it sounds like it hits the expected notes. Lewis’s system, in contrast, generates surprises in dialogue with a performer, sometimes taking a solo, sometimes laying out while the human solos – neither the human nor the machine dominates.Voyager’s sound is somewhere in between that of avant garde jazz great Sun Ra and a Javanese gamelan ensemble. The values of each system are based on the cultures the musicians and programmers draw from: measurable control v improvised collaboration, making for important differences in the output of each system.View image in fullscreen‘Voyager’s sound is somewhere in between that of avant garde jazz great Sun Ra (above) and a Javanese gamelan ensemble.’ Photograph: Andrew Putler/RedfernsNowadays, AI systems have roles in generating text and images, diagnosing disease, and even in autonomous weapons systems. One could make such systems as followers of humans or as creative supports for humans; we can look at the relationship between machine and human as based in command and control – or as based in collaboration, figuring out what people do best and what the computer does best so that they can work fruitfully together. Both approaches have their place – but I feel that currently the latter approach is less well-known and adopted. Creating AI systems based in many different cultures, with proper ethical guidelines, can help to rectify this.People can intentionally design computing systems with the values and worldviews we want. For instance, the MIT Center for Advanced Virtuality, which I founded and direct, has built simulations such as Breakbeat Narratives, a collaboration with Universal Hip Hop Museum and Microsoft. The system utilises our centre’s technologies, characters created with comic book artists Black Kirby, Microsoft conversational AI and music archival content from the TunesMap Educational Foundation to teach hip-hop history according to the user’s musical tastes and interests. For instance, if you like roots music and are interested in female hip-hop artists, you can get a short documentary on the self-representation of women in hip-hop that has a soundtrack of hip-hop songs that sample from country and western and bluegrass.I also had the pleasure of collaborating with war photojournalist and VR artist Karim Ben Khelifa on a project he directed called The Enemy, which enabled viewers to journalistically hear the perspectives of combatants on both sides of conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, El Salvador and Gaza – while customising the experience based on users’ body language as a proxy for their potential biases and attentiveness.We build AI and computing systems for creative expression, learning and the social good by meaningfully customising stories and experiences for the people using them. There is a great opportunity for AI to have a positive social impact through such design – but to do so, the field will need to be more interdisciplinary, valuing the aims and insights of the arts, humanities and social science.I’m not promoting a utopian view of AI. You’ve probably heard about recent approaches such as “deep learning” and “large-language models” – of systems such as Dall·E 2 and GPT-4. People have been using them for many purposes: gamers create characters for Dungeons & Dragons, attorneys craft legal motions.Such systems utilise neural networks and approaches involving deep learning and large language models. It is hard for humans to interpret exactly why they output the particular images or text that they do (the system’s “reasons” are a pattern of finely tuned statistical values and numerical weights). When processes are opaque, and driven by large datasets that also are based on cultural values, it’s possible for unfair biases and other social ills to find their way into the systems.We need to be aware of, and thoughtfully design, the cultural values that AI is based on. With care, we can build systems based on multiple worldviews – and address key ethical issues in design such as transparency and intelligibility. AI does offer extraordinary creative opportunities; but creators need to do social-cultural work that is at least as hard as technically engineering these systems – and perhaps harder. There are times when a command-and-control paradigm is appropriate in computing. However, when looking at AI, there are times when, instead, we need to see more jazz-like opportunities for creative, collaborative improvisation.

Updated with additional commentary

While the Hollywood writer’s strike has reached and passed 100 days, a new report out says almost every entertainment and media company plans to boost generative AI spend. In fact, they are global leaders.


“Companies in the entertainment, technology and consumer products industries are frontrunners in plans to increase generative AI spending,” Lucidworks, a search and insights company that commissioned the report, says.

But the media companies aren’t alone.
Generative AI planned spend by countryLucidworks
PROMOTED
As many as 96% of executives involved in AI decisions are prioritizing generative AI investments, and that means that most companies globally are investing. China leads with 100% of companies saying they are investing in generative AI, while 94% of U.K. and 95% of French companies say the same. In India, 98% of companies are also pouring resources into generative AI, while 92% of U.S. companies say they are as well.
(This data is based on what Lucidworks says is the largest global study of generative AI in business, involving 6,000 survey respondents at companies with more than 100 employees who are involved in decisions on AI investments.)

With numbers like these, virtually every industry is rushing headlong to build, use or buy generative AI technology.
That’s a key concern of Hollywood writers, of course, and Wired says they’re right to fear AI. An OpenAI study on the “labor market impact potential of large language models” published in March says that multiple categories of writers are up to 100% exposed to career and work impact from AI. That does not necessarily mean that AI will take their jobs—though in some cases it could—but it will almost certainly have some impact in how they do their jobs.

Generative AI job impact for writers: fully exposed.John Koetsier

“Generative AI is imposing massive change on global business, presenting unprecedented opportunities and challenges—and at a breakneck speed,” the Lucidworks report says. “This new technology can generate content, images, and even entire virtual environments autonomously, thereby disrupting various industries.”
That massive change at breakneck speed, of course, is what worries most people. AI is improving so quickly—including full video generation from text prompts—that a full movie might be generated from prompts in just a few years. (Note: no comment on the quality of that movie.)
One author has predicted that 90% of Hollywood content might be at least in part AI generated by 2025.
Based on the investment media and entertainment companies are making, that could be possible. According to the report, only consumer products companies, tech companies and construction and real estate companies are investing at similar levels.Generative AI spend by industry, according to Lucidworks.Lucidworks
Even the relative laggards, however, are overwhelmingly planning large and fast generative AI deployments.
“Now is the time to understand the strategy and operational opportunities of generative AI,” Mike Sinoway, the CEO of Lucidworks, said in a statement. “The fundamental shift that is occurring is rapid, global, and highly impactful. This study confirms the emergence of generative AI industry leaders and laggards, and those that move swiftly to orient their practices can move ahead quickly.”
One way that might manifest for the actors of the SAG-AFTRA union who are also on strike alongside the writers is synthetic actors. We’ve been seeing synthetic models and still photography subjects for years now, but deepfakes of existing and past actors are now showing that AI-generated and enhanced “talent” is a real threat.
As entrepreneur, investor and analyst Jeremiah Owyang mentioned in response to this story, synthetic actors don’t strike, don’t ask for pay raises, never take sick days, and never age. Even more intriguing for studios but concerning for actors is that they can also be used in literally millions of very personally targeted ads.

When Evanston, Illinois-based Darren Angle was in talks to join biotech research startup Prism Analytic Technologies in May, “head of AI” wasn’t even a position yet.


“We were trying to come up with a title,” says Angle, a software engineer who previously worked on artificial intelligence at Shopify and now, as the startup’s “head of AI,” builds large language models for pharma companies and scientists. “It was sort of like, ‘let’s figure out what the role is going to be.’”

Now, there are a lot more of those positions, and titles for them are coming into view. According to new data released Tuesday in LinkedIn’s Future of Work report, the share of global English-language job postings on the platform mentioning GPT or ChatGPT has increased 21 times since November 2022, when OpenAI first released its AI chatbot into the world.

“We’re seeing the evolution of jobs now changing faster than it was before,” says LinkedIn chief economist Karin Kimbrough. Newer job titles include chief AI officer, AI engineer, head of AI, AI specialist, AI advisor and AI data scientist. The number of U.S. companies with a head of AI has nearly tripled in the last five years, according to LinkedIn’s report.

Other job sites are also seeing a boom in AI-related jobs. As of August 11, Indeed had 529 listings for generative AI-related jobs per one million postings on the site—its highest yet, up from 104 per million on November 30, 2022.
While hiring has slowed, Indeed economist Cory Stahle says, demand for people with AI skills is still high. “We’ve gone from this really fast boil to a still really warm pot of water here,” he says.
ZipRecruiter saw 1,309 generative AI-related job postings in July—its highest yet—compared to just 21 listings a year prior, the job search engine said.
Whether the jobs AI creates will outweigh the ones it erases won’t be clear for years. LinkedIn’s report follows months of reports predicting how many jobs AI will replace: Goldman Sachs estimates AI could replace 300 million full-time jobs. Employers surveyed by the World Economic Forum in a May report predict AI will eliminate 83 million jobs by 2027, but create 69 million—a net decrease of 14 million jobs.
John Sviokla, cofounder of advisory firm GAI Insights and a long-time AI advisor to companies like PwC, compares the buzz to “when people predicted drivers were going to go away” following the introduction of driverless cars. “That was exactly the wrong answer,” he says.
Other potential job titles predicted to grow: Ethicists and chief trust officers. As companies integrate more AI into their systems, says Sameer Maskey, founder of AI technology and education firm Fusemachines, it will be important for companies to be able to “showcase to their end users that they have done all the things required to make sure the system is not biased.”
The LinkedIn report also found that the platform’s users are rapidly adding AI-oriented skills to their profiles, a likely sign job seekers see AI opportunities increasing. The rate at which LinkedIn users added generative AI-related skills, such as natural language processing, classification or “question answering”—the ability to efficiently respond to questions in a way that best prompts AI models—has nearly doubled. In the seven months leading up to ChatGPT’s launch last November, that rate was 7.7%; in the seven months following it, it increased 13%.

	More than 100 days into the writers strike, fears have kept mounting over the possibility of studios deploying generative artificial intelligence to completely pen scripts. But intellectual property law has long said that copyrights are only granted to works created by humans, and that doesn’t look like it’s changing anytime soon.

	A federal judge on Friday upheld a finding from the U.S. Copyright Office that a piece of art created by AI is not open to protection. The ruling was delivered in an order turning down Stephen Thaler’s bid challenging the government’s position refusing to register works made by AI. Copyright law has “never stretched so far” to “protect works generated by new forms of technology operating absent any guiding human hand,” U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell found.

	The opinion stressed, “Human authorship is a bedrock requirement.”

	The push for protection of works created by AI has been spearheaded by Thaler, chief executive of neural network firm Imagination Engines. In 2018, he listed an AI system, the Creativity Machine, as the sole creator of an artwork called A Recent Entrance to Paradise, which was described as “autonomously created by a computer algorithm running on a machine.” The Copyright Office denied the application on the grounds that “the nexus between the human mind and creative expression” is a crucial element of protection.



	Thaler, who listed himself as the owner of the copyright under the work-for-hire doctrine, sued in a lawsuit contesting the denial and the office’s human authorship requirement. He argued that AI should be acknowledged “as an author where it otherwise meets authorship criteria,” with any ownership vesting in the machine’s owner. His complaint argued that the office’s refusal was “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion and not in accordance with the law” in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, which provides for judicial review of agency actions. The question presented in the suit was whether a work generated solely by a computer falls under the protection of copyright law.

	“In the absence of any human involvement in the creation of the work, the clear and straightforward answer is the one given by the Register: No,” Howell wrote.

	U.S. copyright law, she underscored, “protects only works of human creation” and is “designed to adapt with the times.” There’s been a consistent understanding that human creativity is “at the core of copyrightability, even as that human creativity is channeled through new tools or into new media,” the ruling stated.

	










	While cameras generated a mechanical reproduction of a scene, she explained that they do so only after a human develops a “mental conception” of the photo, which is a product of decisions like where the subject stands, arrangements and lighting, among other choices.

	“Human involvement in, and ultimate creative control over, the work at issue was key to the conclusion that the new type of work fell within the bounds of copyright,” Howell wrote.

	Various courts have reached the same conclusion. In one of the leading cases on copyright authorship, Burrow-Giles Lithographic Company v. Sarony, the Supreme Court held that there was “no doubt” that protection can be extended to photographs as long as “they are representative of original intellectual conceptions of the author.” The justices exclusively referred to such authors as human, describing them as a class of “persons” and a copyright as the “right of a man to the production of his own genius or intellect.”

	In another case, the a federal appeals court said that a photo captured by a monkey can’t be granted a copyright since animals don’t qualify for protection, though the suit was decided on other grounds. Howell cited the ruling in her decision. “Plaintiff can point to no case in which a court has recognized copyright in a work originating with a non-human,” the order, which granted summary judgment in favor of the copyright office, stated.

	The judge also explored the purpose of copyright law, which she said is to encourage “human individuals to engage in” creation. Copyrights and patents, she said, were conceived as “forms of property that the government was established to protect, and it was understood that recognizing exclusive rights in that property would further the public good by incentivizing individuals to create and invent.” The ruling continued, “The act of human creation — and how to best encourage human individuals to engage in that creation, and thereby promote science and the useful arts — was thus central to American copyright from its very inception.” Copyright law wasn’t designed to reach nonhuman actors, Howell said.

	










	The order was delivered as courts weigh the legality of AI companies training their systems on copyrighted works. The suits, filed by artists and artists in California federal court, allege copyright infringement and could result in the firms having to destroy their large language models.

	In March, the copyright office affirmed that most works generated by AI aren’t copyrightable but clarified that AI-assisted materials qualify for protection in certain instances. An application for a work created with the help of AI can support a copyright claim if a human “selected or arranged” it in a “sufficiently creative way that the resulting work constitutes an original work of authorship,” it said.

Check out our searchable Books3 database to find specific authors and titles. A deeper analysis of what is in the database is here.One of the most troubling issues around generative AI is simple: It’s being made in secret. To produce humanlike answers to questions, systems such as ChatGPT process huge quantities of written material. But few people outside of companies such as Meta and OpenAI know the full extent of the texts these programs have been trained on.Some training text comes from Wikipedia and other online writing, but high-quality generative AI requires higher-quality input than is usually found on the internet—that is, it requires the kind found in books. In a lawsuit filed in California last month, the writers Sarah Silverman, Richard Kadrey, and Christopher Golden allege that Meta violated copyright laws by using their books to train LLaMA, a large language model similar to OpenAI’s GPT-4—an algorithm that can generate text by mimicking the word patterns it finds in sample texts. But neither the lawsuit itself nor the commentary surrounding it has offered a look under the hood: We have not previously known for certain whether LLaMA was trained on Silverman’s, Kadrey’s, or Golden’s books, or any others, for that matter.To read this story, Sign in or start a subscription.CloseNever miss a story.

Art generated entirely by artificial intelligence cannot be copyrighted because ""human authorship is an essential part of a valid copyright claim,"" a federal judge ruled on Friday.
The US Copyright Office previously rejected plaintiff Stephen Thaler's application for a copyright because the work lacked human authorship, and he challenged the decision in US District Court for the District of Columbia. Thaler and the Copyright Office both moved for summary judgment in motions that ""present the sole issue of whether a work generated entirely by an artificial system absent human involvement should be eligible for copyright,"" Judge Beryl Howell's memorandum opinion issued Friday noted.Enter your email to get the Ars Technica newsletterclose dialogJoin Ars Technica andGet Our Best Tech StoriesDelivered Straight to your Inbox.Please enter aboveSIGN ME UPBy signing up, you agree to our user agreement (including the  class action waiver and arbitration provisions), our privacy policy and cookie statement, and to receive marketing and account-related emails from Ars Technica.

Howell denied Thaler's motion for summary judgment, granted the Copyright Office's motion, and ordered that the case be closed.
Thaler sought a copyright for an image titled, ""A Recent Entrance to Paradise,"" which was produced by a computer program that he developed, the ruling said. In his application for a copyright, he identified the author as the Creativity Machine, the name of his software.
Image “created by a computer algorithm”
Thaler's application ""explained the work had been 'autonomously created by a computer algorithm running on a machine,' but that plaintiff sought to claim the copyright of the 'computer-generated work' himself 'as a work-for-hire to the owner of the Creativity Machine,'"" Howell wrote. ""The Copyright Office denied the application on the basis that the work 'lack[ed] the human authorship necessary to support a copyright claim,' noting that copyright law only extends to works created by human beings.""
The denial was in August 2019. Howell petitioned the Copyright Office again, saying that AI should be ""acknowledge[d]... as an author where it otherwise meets authorship criteria, with any copyright ownership vesting in the AI's owner."" The Copyright Office again refused to register the work in 2020 and 2022. Ars VideoHow The Callisto Protocol's Gameplay Was Perfected Months Before Release
""Because copyright law is limited to 'original intellectual conceptions of the author,' the Office will refuse to register a claim if it determines that a human being did not create the work,"" the second refusal letter in March 2020 said.
Thaler last year lost a different case over whether AI software can be the registered inventor on a patent. US patent law requires inventors to be human, a federal appeals court ruled in the August 2022 ruling against Thaler.
Plaintiff “put cart before the horse”
In the Friday ruling on copyright of an AI-generated image, Judge Howell wrote that Thaler attempted ""to complicate the issues presented by devoting a substantial portion of his briefing to the viability of various legal theories under which a copyright in the computer's work would transfer to him, as the computer's owner; for example, by operation of common law property principles or the work-for-hire doctrine."" But these arguments ""put the cart before the horse"" because they only address ""to whom a valid copyright should have been registered,"" not whether a copyright can be granted for a work generated without human involvement, Howell wrote.
""United States copyright law protects only works of human creation,"" Howell wrote.
Thaler ""correctly observes"" that ""copyright law has proven malleable enough to cover works created with or involving technologies developed long after traditional media of writings memorialized on paper,"" the ruling said. The US Copyright Act of 1976 says that copyright attaches to ""original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression, now known or later developed... either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.""
""Underlying that adaptability, however, has been a consistent understanding that human creativity is the sine qua non at the core of copyrightability, even as that human creativity is channeled through new tools or into new media,"" Howell wrote.
Thaler pointed out that the Copyright Act does not define the word ""author."" But Howell wrote that the law's ""'authorship' requirement as presumptively being human rests on centuries of settled understanding.""

TechnologyMcKinsey launches Lilli: An in-house generative AI tool for its workforceLilli was developed to adhere to McKinsey's exacting technology standards, utilising leading-edge platforms within the industry. 







 

McKinsey and Company, garnered attention earlier this year for its swift adoption of generative AI tools. In June, the company announced that almost half of its 30,000 employees had embraced this technology.

Now, the firm introduced its proprietary generative AI tool named Lilli. Developed by McKinsey's ClienTech team led by CTO Jacky Wright, Lilli is a fresh chat application tailored for the company's employees. Also Read:

This innovative tool offers a spectrum of functionalities, including dispensing information, insights, data, plans, and even suggesting the most suitable internal experts for consulting initiatives. These capabilities are founded on an extensive database of over 100,000 documents and interview transcripts.
“Lilli aggregates our knowledge and capabilities in one place for the first time and will allow us to spend more time with clients activating those insights and recommendations and maximising the value we can create. An engagement team will be able to spend more time on problem-solving, coaching, building capabilities, and helping clients achieve the performance they aspire to achieve” said Erik Roth, a senior partner with McKinsey who leads the firm’s development of Lilli and integrating Gen AI technologies into the way we work.
In honour of Lillian Dombrowski, the initial woman employed by McKinsey in a professional services capacity in 1945, the AI tool has been christened Lilli. Having undergone a beta phase since June 2023, Lilli is scheduled for a full-scale implementation throughout McKinsey this upcoming autumn.
How does Lilli operate? 
When a user inputs a question, Lilli can scan our extensive knowledge database, pinpointing five to seven of the most pertinent pieces of content. It then condenses the essential points, incorporates links, and can even recognize experts in the relevant domains. The platform offers two distinct modes: one for exploring McKinsey's internal knowledge repository and another option for external sources.
Lilli was meticulously crafted in alignment with McKinsey's rigorous technology benchmarks, employing top-tier platforms in the industry. The tool was then put to the test with actual users, including both consultants and internal clients. Phil Hudelson, a McKinsey partner at the helm of technology platform development, highlights that, in a way, the technological aspect was the straightforward aspect of this endeavour. 
The primary challenge lay in maintaining swiftness while engaging the appropriate stakeholders, including legal, cyber security, risk management, and talent development experts. This comprehensive approach was essential to ensure the tool's effectiveness firmwide.

        DEAR READERS: There’s a lot of concern out there about what artificial intelligence is going to do on the employment front, but I’ve heard that job seekers really can use AI to their advantage. Is that true? And how can people looking for a job get help from AI?Marc Cenedella, founder of Leet Resumes, is a good person to ask, considering he has been working in the AI and machine-learning space for three years.“I am confident in saying job applicants can view AI as a friend rather than a foe,” says Cenedella, who recommends that job seekers use “specialized AI platforms to ensure outputs are specifically tailored to their unique needs.”
“AI can be a valuable resource in several ways,” says Amelia Thomas, head of marketing for FlexiPCB.The areas in which AI can enhance results during a job search include:

Job recommendations. According to Thomas, AI-powered platforms can analyze your skills, experience, and preferences to recommend relevant job opportunities that align with your profile.
“This saves time and helps you discover positions you may not have come across otherwise,” she says.And while Cenedella says specialized AI is best for creating resumes, he notes that generic models can be useful in interview planning.
“It’s very helpful to prompt, ‘Give me a 500-word summary of (company name) written for someone applying for a job there.’ This will help you get a good summary of the company’s business,” he explains. “A job seeker can then ask, ‘Based on this pasted job description, what are the likely three top things the company is looking for in this candidate?’”Resume and cover-letter assistance.
“AI tools can help optimize keywords, offer formatting recommendations and enhance the overall effectiveness of your application materials,” Thomas says.Skill development. AI-based learning platforms can recommend personalized training programs and courses based on your desired skills and career goals.

“This can help you enhance your qualifications and stay competitive in the job market,” Thomas notes.Interview preparation. Because AI chatbots and virtual interview platforms can simulate interview scenarios, you can practice and refine responses to typical interview questions.“This helps build confidence, improve communication skills and enhance performance during interviews,” Thomas says.Networking and job-market insights.
“AI-powered platforms can assist you in expanding your professional network by suggesting relevant connections and networking opportunities,” says Thomas, who notes that they can also provide market insights, such as salary ranges and industry trends, to help you make informed career decisions.
As helpful as AI can be in a job search, Thomas adds one caution for anyone about to embark on a job search.“It is essential to complement AI tools with personal networking efforts and traditional job-search strategies for a well-rounded approach,” she stresses.
Cenedella also says it is important to clarify that ChatGPT and similar large language models “aren’t really artificial intelligence.”""They’re more like artificial conventional wisdom,"" he says. ""They simply predict the next word that should appear based on analysis of everything ever written. It produces generic, formulaic responses that won’t help anyone stand out. To leverage these services well, you need a firm understanding of what prompts to input, and that can be a job in itself.”

“Human authorship is a bedrock requirement of copyright.” — Judge Beryl Howell, United States Federal District Court for the District of Columbia.

On Friday, Judge Beryl Howell issued an opinion in Dr. Stephen Thaler’s challenge against the U.S. Copyright Office (USCO) over the denial of his application for a work generated entirely using generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The opinion supports the USCO’s refusal to register a work in which the claimant disclosed in the application that the image was the result of an AI system, called The Creativity Machine. The case is Stephen Thaler v. Shira Perlmutter and The United States Copyright Office (1:22-cv-01564) (June 2, 2022).
“Human authorship is a bedrock requirement of copyright,” writes Judge Howell.
“We disagree with the District Court’s ruling,” Dr. Ryan Abbott shared in a written statement. “The public is the primary beneficiary of copyright law, and the public benefits when systems are in place to promote the generation and dissemination of new works, regardless of how they are created.”
“The Copyright Office believes the court reached the correct result. We are reviewing the decision, and we have no further comment at this time,” said a spokeperson from the Copyright Office.
Abbott serves as a member of the team representing Thaler in a variety of cases aiming to challenge intellectual property laws around the world when it comes to human authorship.
The opinion comes just over a year after the original complaint was filed against the USCO in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. following a series of three different letter opinions issued by the USCO’s Review Board. The lawsuit also named Shira Perlmutter, in her official capacity as Register of Copyrights and Director of the USCO. The image in question is known as “A Recent Entrance to Paradise,” and initially was claimed by Thaler to have been the result of a sentient machine, commonly referred to as the point of singularity.
Thaler filed a motion for summary judgment in January, arguing the only question at issue is: “Can someone register a copyright in a creative work made by an artificial intelligence?” The USCO filed a response in February along with a cross-motion for summary judgment. The motions were filed by reply briefs from Thaler in March and the USCO in April. The USCO argued, “[the USCO’s decision] was a well-reasoned decision based on the text of the Constitution and the Act, as well as Supreme Court and appellate decisions that uniformly support a human authorship requirement.”
 
Summary Judgment and the Administrative Records
In a one-page order, Judge Howell granted the USCO’s request for summary judgment (filed as a cross-motion) while also denying summary judgment to Thaler.
A longer memorandum decision was published simultaneously and highlights the impact the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) had on this particular case, which was limited to a judicial review of the actions taken by the administrative agency, the USCO in case. Additionally, the decision stems from summary judgment actions and is based solely on the question of law, meaning it’s limited to reviewing the administrative record.
The court immediately notes that the administrative record fails to include any of the additional detail Thaler argues in support of “his development, use, ownership, and prompting of the AI generating software”, which means it must ignore Thaler’s attempts at arguing “various legal theories” that jump over the analysis of whether copyright law recognizes non-human creation. 
Instead, Judge Howell writes that the “only question properly presented, then, is whether the Register acted arbitrarily or capriciously or otherwise in violation of the APA in reaching that conclusion.” 
The answer is made abundantly clear: “The Register did not err in denying the copyright registration application presented by plaintiff.”
In reference to sentient machines and AI, a footnote explains it’s “fun conjecture for academics,” quoting Justin Hughes in The Columbia Journal of Law & the Arts, to think about “authors” as anything but referring to humans, despite not being explicitly defined as such in the Copyright Act.
Judge Howell explains that Thaler’s work, despite being the output of an AI system, is “not nearly so complex” as other “new frontiers” the world is facing with copyright law and technological advancements. The main reasoning presented is pulled from the administrative record, pointing to Thaler’s “controlling role” and involvement in configuring The Creativity Machine to be able to output the image in question.
A turning point for this decision appears to be that Thaler never attempted to correct the application record as to his actual involvement in the synthetic output of the software. Therefore, the court reasons that the USCO was correct in denying the application as having no human authorship—again, as Thaler originally claimed— choosing to correctly overlook his later statements of having involvement.
The court concludes that the work never had any valid copyright upon its creation, and therefore it shouldn’t be registered. Also, it notes that there is no valid work-made-for-hire argument since there was no interest in a work to be transferred.
 
An Appeal in the Works
“We believe protection for AI-generated works is entirely consistent with the language of the Copyright Act and plan to appeal,” Abbott also explained.
Earlier this year, Thaler was denied certiorari by the U.S. Supreme Court as part of an attempt to question the definition of “inventor” and whether it is limited to humans. It remains to be seen whether or not a similar outcome is on the horizon for Thaler in regard to copyright law.
The USCO has spent a significant amount of time during the past year simultaneously listening to and educating stakeholders on the subject of generative AI. Judge Howell’s opinion is directly in support of the USCO’s recent efforts.
The USCO currently interprets copyright law in the U.S. to not afford protections to works created by generative AI that have no human involvement. Instead, the spectrum of creativity is dependent upn the application of a de minimis standard and analysis to determine whether there was sufficient human authorship. Practically speaking, this approach requires separating out human and non-human contributions to a work.
Judge Howell’s decision does not come as much of a surprise to followers of these issues. As explained by the court in this decision, we’ve seen numerous times previously where courts consistently uphold a human authorship requirement, and there’s no reason this case should be any different simply because it involves generative AI.
For anything to change in copyright law, it will take congressional action. However for Thaler, it seems the battle was lost, but the war will continue.
