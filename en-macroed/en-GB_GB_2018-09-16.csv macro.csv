With this net positive job growth, there is expected to be a major shift in quality, location and permanency for the new roles. And companies are expected to expand the use of contractors doing specialized work and utilize remote staffing.









World Economic Forum's Automation Rate Graph
World Economic Forum





In 2025, machines are expected to perform more current work tasks than humans compared to 71% being performed by humans as of now. Due to this transformation, it will have a major impact on the global workforce.
PROMOTED
This report is intended to provide guidance on how to improve the quality of the work being done by humans and how people should become prepared for emerging roles. And it is based on a survey of chief human resources officers and strategy executives from more than 300 global companies across 12 industries and 20 emerging economies.

Plus the report has determined that 54% of employees of large companies would need to up-skill in order to fully harness these growth opportunities. Over half of the companies surveyed said that they plan to train only employees in key roles and only one-third are planning to train at-risk workers.
Nearly 50% of all companies are expecting their full-time workforce to shrink by 2022 due to automation, but 40% are expecting to extend their workforce and more than 25% are expecting automation to create new roles in the enterprise.

""It is critical that business take an active role in supporting their existing workforces through reskilling and upskilling, that individuals take a proactive approach to their own lifelong learning, and that governments create an enabling environment to facilitate this workforce transformation. This is the key challenge of our time,"" said World Economic Forum founder and executive chairman Klaus Schwab.
Some of the fastest growing job opportunities across all industries include data analysts, software developers and social media specialists. Plus jobs that require “human skills” like sales and marketing, innovation and customer service are also expected to increase in demand. Some of the jobs that are expected to go away include data entry, payroll and certain accounting functions. The WEF is working across multiple industries to design roadmaps to respond to these new opportunities.
The respondents provided three strategies to cope with these challenges. This includes hiring wholly new permanent staff with skills around new technologies, completely automating certain work tasks and retraining existing employees. And a smaller number of companies are expecting to allocate the work to freelancers and temporary workers.
Workforce expansion will vary across industries says the WEF report. Companies that are projecting a higher amount of job losses tend to be in the mining, consumer and IT industries than companies in professionals services. Between 2018 and 2022, the aviation and tourism industries are expected to see the highest amount of retraining. Physical tasks are also expected to be significantly replaced by mechanized labor so that humans can focus on more productive tasks.
And the report also pointed out that the demand of roles across certain regions also varies. There is expecting to be a growing demand of financial and investment advisors in East Asia and the Pacific and Western Europe, assembly and factory workers in Latin America and the Caribbean, Middle East and North Africa, South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa and electrical engineers in North America.
This WEF report seems to reaffirm a previous study that PwC put together where it was determined that AI, robotics and smart automation technology will bring greater economic benefits. And this could contribute up to $15 trillion to global GDP by 2030.Follow me on Twitter. Amit ChowdhryI have written over 20,000 articles about startups, gadgets and large technology companies over the last ten years.

Should social workers be among them? It might seem that the particular and personal skills of social work are of a nature that could never be replaced by a machine, but from the point of view of an economist they are part of the machinery to provide help in the most cost-effective way. This involves judgment: which families need what kind of help most urgently? And that kind of classification is one of the things that various forms of artificial intelligence promise to do better and more quickly than unaided human beings. It involves the ability to detect significance in a mass of confusing information, often in ways that are hard to explain – a faculty that in humans is called intuition. When computers do it, it is called machine learning. In neither case is it wholly reliable.The augmentation or replacement of social workers with machine learning is the possibility raised by our report that five English councils are trialling software which will help to pick out families and children in need of intervention. It is not the only danger of the projects. There are obvious problems around informed consent: as far back as 2012, Dame Louise Casey took the view that demanding informed consent for the use of the relevant data damaged society as a whole and particularly its most vulnerable members. This is not what the Guardian believes. Nor, after the GDPR, is it what the law allows.Then there is the fallibility of the algorithms themselves: the way in which putting human prejudices into software makes AI “money laundering for bias”. Beyond that is the further danger that even if this function of social workers and other professionals can be successfully augmented by machine learning, that might tend to make all the other things they do look less important when in fact they will become much more so.Yet Ms Casey’s argument has an intuitive force. We are all leaving increasingly large trails of data behind us as we move through life. At the moment it is mostly analysed in order to sell us things more efficiently. It would be absurd for society not to make use of it for more valuable purposes. If informed consent could be obtained from everyone within a council’s area, there are no doubt interesting and useful things that could be discovered. But that kind of analysis would have to involve all citizens. The more data these algorithms have, the better the results will be. Importantly, this must not just be data on “problem” families. We cannot know how they differ from the norm without a great deal of data from the families who will never trouble social work departments. This is unlikely to be politically as popular as the idea of automating hard-pressed social services departments.None of this happens in a vacuum. Technology is not bestowed on us by benevolent gods. It is deployed in response to pre-existing social and economic pressures. Why might local government want to invest in this kind of thing, and why might central government want to believe in it? To ask the question is to answer it. The technology appears to promise a magical way to slip out of the vice of rising costs, demand and expectation on the one side, and shrinking revenues on the other.But there is no magic escape here. In some cases the enthusiastic deployment of technology can make a bad situation very much worse. The good intentions of local councils will only be rewarded if they are properly funded from the centre.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionSocial workLocal governmentComputingeditorialsShareReuse this contentMost viewedUnderground cave found on moon could be ideal base for explorersFormer classmate describes Trump rally gunman as ‘definitely conservative’LiveTrump picks JD Vance as his running mate – liveAOC to anonymous Democrat who said party resigned to Trump win: ‘Retire’Blue Maga: we need to talk about the cult-like turn of the Democratic partyMehdi Hasan",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Artificial Intelligence in Business Gets Real
Pioneering Companies Aim for AI at Scale








September 17, 2018


by: Sam Ransbotham, Philipp Gerbert, Martin Reeves, David Kiron, and Michael Spira


Companies are looking to artificial intelligence to create business value, and as MIT Sloan Management Review’s 2018 Global Executive Study and Research Report on AI shows, Pioneer organizations are pulling ahead of their counterparts. By deepening their commitment to AI and focusing on revenue-generating applications over cost savings, these early implementers are positioning themselves to reap the benefits of AI at scale.















Executives in companies around the world are increasingly looking to artificial intelligence to create new sources of business value. This is especially true for leading adopters of AI — those that have invested in AI initiatives and seen impressive results. This small group of companies is doubling down on AI investments, building competencies, and working to take AI to scale. The opportunities and challenges these AI Pioneers face are the focus of the 2018 MIT Sloan Management Review and The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Artificial Intelligence Global Executive Study and Research Report.
Continuing last year’s analytical approach, our latest research combines a global survey of 3,076 business executives and 36 in-depth interviews with business executives. We classified the organizations surveyed into four groups based on respondents’ responses to questions about their levels of AI adoption and AI understanding. Pioneers are enterprises that have extensive understanding of AI tools and concepts and significant levels of AI adoption; Investigators understand AI but have limited adoption; Experimenters have adopted AI but with limited understanding of it, and Passives have limited adoption and understanding of AI.

The research and analysis for this report was conducted under the direction of the authors as part of an MIT Sloan Management Review research initiative in collaboration with and sponsored by The Boston Consulting Group and the BCG Henderson Institute.

This report highlights four major patterns in the survey and interview data:

Pioneers are deepening their commitments to AI. Is AI really taking off in business? In one respect, the percentage of Pioneers among survey respondents remained essentially the same as last year, at just under one-fifth of those polled. Yet the level of commitment to AI within the Pioneer group is striking: Fully 88% of Pioneers invested more in AI than in the previous year — in contrast to just 62% of Experimenters and Investigators. Pioneers continue to push forward.
Pioneers are eager to scale AI throughout their enterprise. Typically, an organization that gained early success with AI did so because some AI-knowledgeable managers within a business unit spotted a problem that could be solved more effectively with, for example, natural language processing. Attacking such targets in isolation, they came up with impressive solutions. However, these point solutions left enterprises with no greater systemic capabilities than they had before.

“Infrastructure capabilities needed to implement AI is coming together at a faster rate than expected. Soon, AI will be an integral part of everything that we do and eventually take over most of the activities that require human ability today. Just like every other transformative idea, AI is a double-edged sword that can be used for the good of mankind or for destructive purposes. It is very important that we aim at regulating AI and start working on new social contracts as machines will start producing everything that we need to live our day-to-day life.”

In addition to the problem of bias I discussed in a previous article, there is also the ‘black box’ problem: if people don’t know how AI comes up with its decisions, they won’t trust it.
In fact, this lack of trust was at the heart of many failures of one of the best-known AI efforts: 
IBM
 Watson – in particular, Watson for Oncology.

Experts were quick to single out the problem. “IBM’s attempt to promote its supercomputer programme to cancer doctors (Watson for Oncology) was a PR disaster,” says Vyacheslav Polonski, Ph.D., UX researcher for 
Google
 and founder of Avantgarde Analytics. “The problem with Watson for Oncology was that doctors simply didn’t trust it.”
When Watson’s results agreed with physicians, it provided confirmation, but didn’t help reach a diagnosis. When Watson didn’t agree, then physicians simply thought it was wrong.
PROMOTED
If the doctors knew how it came to its conclusions, the results might have been different. “AI’s decision-making process is usually too difficult for most people to understand,” Polonski continues. “And interacting with something we don’t understand can cause anxiety and make us feel like we’re losing control.”

The Need for Explainability
If oncologists had understood how Watson had come up with its answers – what the industry refers to as ‘explainability’ – their trust level may have been higher.

Explainability has now become a critical requirement for AI in many contexts beyond healthcare. Take 
Twitter
, for example. “We need to do a much better job at explaining how our algorithms work. Ideally opening them up so that people can actually see how they work. This is not easy for anyone to do,” says Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter. “In fact, there’s a whole field of research in AI called ‘explainability’ that is trying to understand how to make algorithms explain how they make decisions.”
In other cases, people are calling upon AI to make life-or-death decisions. In such situations, explainability is absolutely critical.
It’s no surprise, therefore, that the US Department of Defense (DoD) is investing in Explainable AI (XAI). “Explainable AI—especially explainable machine learning—will be essential if future warfighters are to understand, appropriately trust, and effectively manage an emerging generation of artificially intelligent machine partners,” explains David Gunning, program manager at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), an agency of the DoD. “New machine-learning systems will have the ability to explain their rationale, characterize their strengths and weaknesses, and convey an understanding of how they will behave in the future.”
Healthcare, however, remains one of AI’s most promising areas. “Explainable AI is going to be extremely important for us in healthcare in actually bridging this gap from understanding what might be possible and what might be going on with your health, and actually giving clinicians tools so that they can really be comfortable and understand how to use,” says Sanji Fernando, vice president and head of the OptumLabs Center for Applied Data Science at 
UnitedHealth Group
. “That’s why we think there’s some amazing work happening in academia, in academic institutions, in large companies, and within the federal government, to safely approve this kind of decision making.”
The Explainability Tradeoff
While organizations like DARPA are actively investing in XAI, there is an open question as to whether such efforts detract from the central priority to make AI algorithms better.
Even more concerning: will we need to ‘dumb down’ AI algorithms to make them explainable? “The more accurate the algorithm, the harder it is to interpret, especially with deep learning,” points out Sameer Singh, assistant professor of computer science at the University of California Irvine. “Computers are increasingly a more important part of our lives, and automation is just going to improve over time, so it’s increasingly important to know why these complicated AI and ML systems are making the decisions that they are.”
Some AI research efforts may thus be at cross-purposes with others. “The more complex a system is, the less explainable it will be,” says John Zerilli, postdoctoral fellow at University of Otago and researcher into explainable AI. “If you want your system to be explainable, you’re going to have to make do with a simpler system that isn’t as powerful or accurate.”
The $2 billion that DARPA is investing in what it calls ‘third-wave AI systems,’ however, may very well be sufficient to resolve this tradeoff. “XAI is one of a handful of current DARPA programs expected to enable ‘third-wave AI systems,’ where machines understand the context and environment in which they operate, and over time build underlying explanatory models that allow them to characterize real world phenomena,” DARPA’s Gunning adds.
Skynet, Explain Thyself
Resolving today’s trust issues is important, but there are trust issues in the future as well. If we place the growing field of XAI into the dystopian future that some AI skeptics lay out, we may have a path to preventing such nightmares.
Whether it be HAL 9000, Skynet, or any other Hollywood AI villain, there is always a point in the development of the evil program where it breaks free from the control of its human creators and runs amuck.
If those creators built explainability into such systems, however, then running amuck would be much less likely – or at least, much easier to see coming.
Thanks to XAI, therefore, we can all breathe a sigh of relief.

Nearly all Fortune 500 companies now use some form of automation -- from robot avatars interviewing job candidates to computers weeding out potential employees by scanning keywords in resumes. And more and more companies are using artificial intelligence and machine learning tools to assess possible employees. DeepSense, based in San Francisco and India, helps hiring managers scan people’s social media accounts to surface underlying personality traits. The company says it uses a scientifically based personality test, and it can be done with or without a potential candidate’s knowledge.The practice is part of a general trend of some hiring companies to move away from assessing candidates based on their resumes and skills, towards making hiring decisions based on people’s personalities.The Robot Revolution: An inside look at how humanoid robots are evolving.

SINGAPORE — Workers in Singapore will be hit hard by technological disruptions with the Republic’s labour market set to face the largest degree of job displacement regionally in the next decade, based on a study on the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on workers in six South-east Asian economies.The new study by technology company Cisco and economic forecasting agency Oxford Economics also found that Singapore will have to confront the biggest mismatch between skills and jobs created among the countries in the region.Advertisement 











The findings were released on Wednesday (Sept 12) on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum on Asean (Association of South-east Asian Nations), a high-level gathering on innovation and entrepreneurship in Hanoi.Data showed that about one-fifth of Singapore’s full-time equivalent workforce (20.6 per cent) will have their jobs displaced by 2028. This is higher than the figures for Vietnam (13.8 per cent), Thailand (11.9 per cent), the Philippines (10.1 per cent), Indonesia (8.1 per cent) and Malaysia (7.4 per cent).In absolute numbers, however, the number of workers expected to be displaced in Singapore (500,000) trails those in Indonesia (9.5 million) and Vietnam (7.5 million), for instance.The study noted that Singapore, which is “already close to the frontier of technological progress”, has an exceptional enabling environment for innovation and digital transformation, as well as a small geographical area, and modern and upgradeable infrastructure. This means that businesses can take advantage of innovations as they become available.By contrast, the smaller job displacement in relative terms for other economies such as Indonesia and the Philippines was due to a variety of factors, including a possibly slower pace of technological change, expectations of institutional and political constraints on automation, and a challenging regulatory environment.Advertisement 











The study involved a multidisciplinary team of experts from across the region, who provided insights into the role that technology will play in various sectors and occupations. Data on 433 occupations across 21 industries was tapped to model the impact of these technological-adoption patterns on the 275 million full-time equivalent workers across the six countries by 2028.As displaced workers reskill to move into new jobs, the study suggests that Singapore faces the biggest challenge despite its highly skilled workforce.The Republic is set to confront a gap in average skill levels of 14.3 (on a scale of 100), higher than the Philippines (13.9), Vietnam (13.4), Malaysia (12.7), Thailand (8.5) and Indonesia (8.4).This, said the team behind the study, is due to Singapore’s digital transformation taking place at a faster rate than other Asean countries.The city state’s more supportive environment for investments in robotics and the Internet of Things — the global network of Internet-enabled sensors, devices and systems — will, for example, lead to a much greater displacement of production workers and labourers.Advertisement 











These low-skilled positions will be less affected in the other five countries surveyed in the next 10 years, the study said.“The majority of new job opportunities in Singapore are likely to be created in highly skilled managerial and professional roles, reflecting the growth areas of the economy. Thus, a considerable uplift is required in the overall skills composition of (the) workforce,” it added.The acute skills shortfall in the region stems largely from the areas of information technology skills including those in programming and systems evaluation (41 per cent) and operations skills such as those in installation and operations analysis (12 per cent).Asked to respond to the study’s findings on Singapore, a Manpower Ministry spokesperson said the impact of technology on jobs is often mixed: Although it may reduce the reliance on manpower in some areas, companies that are growing have to hire more workers to fill other jobs.“While keeping an eye on the impact of technology, including artificial intelligence, the Government’s priority is to help workers stay in employment by keeping their skills current or get back into employment quickly if they are displaced,” the spokesperson noted. “Where possible, it is better to intervene upstream before workers are retrenched.”Advertisement 











The ministry’s spokesperson added that statutory board Workforce Singapore and the economic agencies are engaging firms on their transformation plans and manpower needs, so as to support them in reskilling and redeploying workers in jobs at risk to new roles.Mr Naveen Menon, Cisco’s president for South-east Asia, told TODAY that the Government’s initiatives on education and training, such as the SkillsFuture movement for lifelong learning and Professional Conversion Programmes for mid-career switchers, reflect its efforts to help workers to reskill as labour requirements shift.Still, he acknowledged that more can always be done and “one of the key success factors is to focus on the long term”.Governments need to ensure that workers acquire skills that go beyond just technical knowledge, said Mr Menon. The key is to develop a flexible labour market that ensures citizens can transit from one occupation to another.“To do this effectively, citizens need skills like problem-solving, design and critical thinking, leadership, collaboration, conflict resolution, and empathy. In a digital future where everyone will have access to the same data and information, these skills will be the key differentiator between being employable or not,” he added.IN NUMBERSBy 2028, 28 million fewer workers in the region — more than 10 per cent of the present workforce across the six countries — will be needed to produce the same level of output as today.

Agriculture is the industry forecast to be worst hit in Asean, accounting for 9.9 million full-time equivalent workers displaced.

In Singapore, some 85,000 existing roles will disappear, pushing workers into other industries and vocations.

The wholesale and retail sector is set to face the highest levels of displacement in Singapore by 2028 (80,000 jobs), followed by manufacturing (55,000) and transport (50,000).

However, wholesale and retail is also poised to see the greatest job creation in Singapore in the same period (100,000 jobs). Manufacturing will come second (70,000 jobs), followed by finance and insurance (60,000 jobs).
