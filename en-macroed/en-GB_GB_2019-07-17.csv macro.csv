The European Commission has given itself the mission of drawing up rules for the age of artificial intelligence over the next five years, building on its legacy as the world’s premier regulator of online privacy.
With Europe trying to catch up to China and the United States in developing AI, some researchers and tech companies have warned against hard rules they say could slow innovation.
But top EU officials are undeterred.

Ursula von der Leyen, the next European Commission president, has joined national governments and EU digital policymakers in calling for hard rules to govern artificial intelligence, sooner rather than later.
“In my first 100 days in office, I will put forward legislation for a coordinated European approach on the human and ethical implications of artificial intelligence,” the German former defense minister, who was narrowly confirmed by the European Parliament this week, wrote in her agenda for Europe.
“It will be the job of the next Commission to deliver something so that we have regulation similar to the General Data Protection Regulation that makes it clear that artificial intelligence serves humanity” — German Chancellor Angela Merkel
Her predecessor, Jean-Claude Juncker, chose not to legislate on AI over the past five years, focusing instead on privacy, cybersecurity, copyright and telecoms.
But AI, which allows computers to do tasks that previously required human thinking, has grabbed policymakers’ attention. The prospect of major AI-linked disruption in industries such as health, agriculture and transport has fueled debate over whether hard rules are necessary, as well as over who should be in charge of writing them.
To determine the scope of regulation, the Commission relied on an expert group including academics, civil society and industry representatives.

The group recently said the EU should think twice about drafting new legislation.
But capitals want to push ahead. In late June, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she wants rules similar to the General Data Protection Regulation — Europe’s sweeping privacy reform — to see the light of day in the next five years.
“It will be the job of the next Commission to deliver something so that we have regulation similar to the General Data Protection Regulation that makes it clear that artificial intelligence serves humanity,” she said.
The European Commission’s digital department has already started working on such a plan, according to an internal document from June, seen by POLITICO. Artificial intelligence “carries huge promises (from treating chronic diseases ...[to] anticipating cybersecurity risks), but also concerns (job losses, ethical implications),” it states.
The document is not final, and commissioners could choose not to follow up on the recommendations. But von der Leyen’s statements indicate she is ready to go in that direction.
Specifically, the Commission’s digital department recommends a regulatory framework for AI that would set transparency obligations on automated decision-making. The legislation would also require that AI systems be assessed to ensure they do not perpetuate discrimination or violate fundamental rights such as privacy.

Systems that could have a negative impact, such as facial recognition, would face “further constraints.” Voluntary measures, such as certifications or codes of conduct, could also be added to the framework.
A European industrial strategy for AI should also be defined, the Commission recommends. Investment in research and innovation should be increased by using EU programs from the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), such as Horizon Europe.

Artificial intelligence jobs are not a new phenomenon, but the AI job market is growing as AI market itself is seeing rapid expansion. According to research firm IDC, AI is currently seeing an annual growth rate approach 40 percent.
Amid these changes, AI job titles have changed and expanded – and AI paychecks are heading skyward. Earlier roles were “statistician” or “mathematician,” while today you’ll hear newer terms like “data scientist”  and “predictive analytics expert.”
The rapid emergence of new AI titles reflects the fact that AI has become practical for mainstream use as the result of affordable cloud computing and storage costs, a change from prohibitively expensive supercomputers. The growth of AI companies and the expansion of related technology like machine learning has expanded AI job titles.
Similarly, some of the AI algorithms used today have existed for several decades, but until recently, they lacked the volume and richness of data required to drive value. Now there are many different types of AI jobs or roles available, some of which merely add “AI” to an existing title (e.g., “AI developer”). Others reflect different aspects of AI (e.g., “data engineer,” “algorithm developer” or “machine learning scientist”).
For the purpose of this article, AI job titles, their general job descriptions and their salary ranges are limited to technical titles.

A typical ad for an AI job in today’s rapid growth artificial intelligence sector.
AI Job Titles
Jobseekers and career builders are wise not to take AI job titles at face value. For example, some companies require data scientist candidates to hold a PhD or MS in Computer Science or Statistics, while other organizations may accept a BS or even no college degree and certain types of experience. Similarly, a “senior” title may require a graduate degree and more experience at some companies than others.
Some of today’s most popular AI job titles include:

AI developer


AI engineer


Algorithm developer


AWS machine learning engineer


Azure data scientist


Data scientist


Lead data engineer


Lead data scientist


Machine learning scientist


ML data developer


Senior data scientist


Senior ML engineer

AI Job Descriptions
It is important to read the mandatory requirements of any job listing to determine whether it is actually a fit. For example, some technical AI positions require R and Python expertise whereas others may only require R or Python experience.
Sometimes job descriptions, including candidate requirements, can differ by industry. For example, in scientific industries such as pharmaceutical companies, PhDs are common, so they may require more advanced degrees for some positions than organizations operating in other industries such as advertising.
Another reason to maintain an open mind about job descriptions is that the people writing and approving job requisitions may lack the technical expertise to articulate what the organization actually needs. The result is sometimes unrealistic qualifications that even the most sought-after experts lack.
Following are some sample job descriptions that are based on actual job postings. They have been abbreviated for easier comparison.

AI Pay Scale 
AI-related jobs tend to share very similar compensation ranges, which may be misleading. While it may seem odd that people with the same title could have base compensation that varies by $50,000 or $100,000, some of the differences have to do with the present levels of compensation in specific markets. For example, jobs in San Francisco and Manhattan tend to pay more than those in other major metropolitan areas given the cost-of-living differences.
Also, a “senior” title may not necessarily be reflected in compensation, which may seem odd. In medium and large companies, those with senior titles tend to be compensated more than people with similar but more junior titles. However, smaller companies with more modest budgets may advertise a senior title in lieu of senior compensation to lure career builders.  
Job candidates should therefore go into a job search with an open mind and research what’s available at that point in time. The candidate should also be clear about which titles and compensation packages are acceptable since a better title may not mean more pay or vice versa.
Current salary ranges for the positions discussed above are:

AI developer: $90,000 – $150,000


AI engineer – $130,000 – $210,000


Algorithm developer – $90,000 – $130,000


Machine learning engineer – $70,000 – $170,000


Azure or AWS data scientist – $85,000 – $160,000

Experts predict how AI will transform the workplaceThis article is more than 5 years oldAs artificial intelligence is increasingly introduced into business, an expert panel – hosted by the Guardian – forecast how it will change our working livesSA MathiesonThu 18 Jul 2019 06.01 EDTLast modified on Thu 18 Jul 2019 06.04 EDTShareWorkplaces should use automation technologies to enhance employees’ jobs rather than to replace humans, according to speakers at an event held by the Guardian on 11 July. However, they saw problems in the introduction of technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and robots, the latter including software as well as physical machines.Will robots replace us?“Humans should not worry too much about replacement, but need to find new ways to work together with AI,” said Chelsea Chen, co-founder of Emotech, a company which makes a voice-operated device called Olly that aims to recognise users’ emotions as well the content of speech.Chen said that human employees are likely to remain better at dealing with people’s emotions than computers. She says Olly can express excitement in response to what a user says, but that does not make it conscious: “Any job which is highly relevant to people will be really hard to replace.”Automation is ideal for office chores that divert employees from their actual jobs, argued Manu Dell’Aquila, technology transformation manager for software staffing consultancy Red Commerce. “There isn’t a single person in my business who will not say there are not enough hours in the day,” he said, and automating administration would help with this.But he added that in some cases automation will lead to redundancies, such as drivers being replaced by autonomous vehicles, and some organisations could force staff to train their software replacements. “I would want to work with staff to build a better set of processes for them to do a more fulfilling job,” he said. “Is that approach going to be used by everybody? Probably not.”Can robots be trusted with the important stuff in business?Cecilia Harvey, chief operating officer of security-focused technology company Quant Network, said that two decades working in banking technology have made her wary about allowing automated systems to manage important processes. She said technology suppliers often tell “the happy trail story”, which talks about improved efficiency and financial savings while ignoring the increased risk of failures.“There are going to be errors, whether it’s humans or robots. It’s more about where do you want those errors to occur,” Harvey said. This means it may make more sense to focus on internal processes where mistakes are unlikely to cause significant problems. But when they could affect clients or have a regulatory impact, “that’s probably not where I would want to have AI. I would want to seriously look deep into what the potential losses are associated with that – not only to clients but to the firm.” She added that this could include reputational damage and recruitment difficulties, as well as financial costs.View image in fullscreen(Panel L-R) Manu Dell’Aquila, technology transformation manager, RED Solutions; Chelsea Chen, co-founder, Emotech; Cecilia Harvey, chief operation officer, Quant Network; Alastair Jardin, head of product, Trint; Alex Hern, UK technology editor, The Guardian. Pictured at the Guardian offices. Photograph: n/a/The GuardianAlastair Jardine, head of product for speech transcription service Trint, said there are specific risks involved with the data needed to establish artificial intelligence systems. These typically develop probability-based models of how to behave by processing large amounts of “training data”, such as audio files of speech and the resulting transcriptions. “We have to be so aware of the data we are using to train things,” said Jardine, adding by way of example that if training data for an automatic transcription service includes swearing, the system may include these words by mistake in its output.Jardine added that there are questions of ethics and privacy over how training data is gathered. Technology giants such as Amazon and Google use much of the information they collect as training data, including through their voice-activated speaker services: “What Amazon has done in gathering voice data and not anonymising it in a sufficient way really worries me,” he said. Google does much the same: “You are effectively training their algorithms for them.”Full disclosure is necessaryPanel members agreed that users should be told whether they are communicating with a human or with software, and when they are being handed from one to the other. “I’m always for full disclosure, and being clear with users that they are speaking to a robot,” said Harvey.Despite the problems to be overcome, the panellists were optimistic over how workplaces will use artificial intelligence systems in five years’ time. Harvey said they could contribute to staff wellbeing, such as through a chatbot asking employees every day if they are happy with work. Jardine expects it will be possible for employees to set up AI systems themselves, rather than needing experts to do this. Chen said organisations could be using AI to open access to high-quality medical diagnosis and education across the world, given the low cost of adding more users to a working automated system.Dell’Aquila said that the workplaces most likely to accept such developments are those aiming to expand their businesses, rather than put people out of work. “I would like the AI revolution within a business to come from a business, not just thrown in from above or by technology teams,” he said.The panel spoke at the Guardian offices on 11 July 2019.Explore more on these topicsSmarter workingArtificial intelligence (AI)Business to businessComputingWork & careersRobotsShareReuse this contentMost viewedTenacious D Australian tour date postponed after comment about Trump shootingNight owls’ cognitive function ‘superior’ to early risers, study suggestsMy sausage-like fingers are not sexy.

Here’s why embracing a learning philosophy may help you stay employed.The next wave of artificial intelligence could make the job market a little like a game of musical chairs, as new automation creates opportunities while rendering other jobs obsolete. So how do you make sure you’re still employed when the music stops? Thriving in the age of automation is less about picking a safe job and more about constantly updating your skills, according to Northeastern University President Joseph Aoun, who wrote Robot-Proof: Higher Education in the Age of Artificial Intelligence. His approach, which he calls humanics, emphasises three areas. First, technical ability, which is understanding how machines work. Second, data discipline, which is learning how to navigate the information that's generated by these machines. And finally, the human discipline, which he defines as “what we humans can do that machines for the foreseeable future, cannot emulate”. The good news is that many of the jobs that go will be replaced by others. Some studies even suggest there’ll be a net increase. But disruption is very likely, and it’s difficult to know which jobs are in danger. That’s why Aoun thinks a learning philosophy might be more useful. The bad news, unfortunately, is that you’ll probably be doing homework forever.This is one of the 101 indispensable things you need to know about work today.

Patrick Winston, a beloved professor and computer scientist at MIT, died on July 19 at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He was 76.
 
A professor at MIT for almost 50 years, Winston was director of MIT’s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory from 1972 to 1997 before it merged with the Laboratory for Computer Science to become MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).
 
A devoted teacher and cherished colleague, Winston led CSAIL’s Genesis Group, which focused on developing AI systems that have human-like intelligence, including the ability to tell, perceive, and comprehend stories. He believed that such work could help illuminate aspects of human intelligence that scientists don’t yet understand.
 
“My principal interest is in figuring out what’s going on inside our heads, and I’m convinced that one of the defining features of human intelligence is that we can understand stories,'” said Winston, the Ford Professor of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science, in a 2011 interview for CSAIL. “Believing as I do that stories are important, it was natural for me to try to build systems that understand stories, and that shed light on what the story-understanding process is all about.”
 
He was renowned for his accessible and informative lectures, and gave a hugely popular talk every year during the Independent Activities Period called “How to Speak.” 
 
“As a speaker he always had his audience in the palm of his hand,” says MIT Professor Peter Szolovits. “He put a tremendous amount of work into his lectures, and yet managed to make them feel loose and spontaneous. He wasn’t flashy, but he was compelling and direct. ”
 
Winston’s dedication to teaching earned him many accolades over the years, including the Baker Award, the Eta Kappa Nu Teaching Award, and the Graduate Student Council Teaching Award.
 
“Patrick’s humanity and his commitment to the highest principles made him the soul of EECS,” MIT President L. Rafael Reif wrote in a letter to the MIT community. “I called on him often for advice and feedback, and he always responded with kindness, candor, wisdom and integrity.  I will be forever grateful for his counsel, his objectivity, and his tremendous inspiration and dedication to our students.”
 
Teaching computers to think
Born Feb. 5, 1943 in Peoria, Illinois, Winston was always exceptionally curious about science, technology and how to use such tools to explore what it means to be human. He was an MIT-lifer starting in 1961, earning his bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degrees from the Institute before joining the faculty of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in 1970.
 
His thesis work with Marvin Minsky centered on the difficulty of learning, setting off a trajectory of work where he put a playful, yet laser-sharp focus on fine-tuning AI systems to better understand stories.
 
His Genesis project aimed to faithfully model computers after human intelligence in order to fully grasp the inner workings of our own motivations, rationality, and perception. Using MIT research scientist Boris Katz’s START natural language processing system and a vision system developed by former MIT PhD student Sajit Rao, Genesis can digest short, simple chunks of text, then spit out reports about how it interpreted connections between events.
 
While the system has processed many works, Winston chose “Macbeth” as a primary text because the tragedy offers an opportunity to take big human themes, such as greed and revenge, and map out their components.
 
“[Shakespeare] was pretty good at his portrayal of ‘the human condition,’ as my friends in the humanities would say,” Winston told The Boston Globe. “So there’s all kinds of stuff in there about what’s typical when we humans wander through the world.”
 
His deep fascination with humanity, human intelligence, and how we communicate information spilled over into what he often described as his favorite academic activity: teaching.
 
“He was a superb educator who introduced the field to generations of students,” says MIT Professor and longtime colleague Randall Davis. “His lectures had an uncanny ability to move in minutes from the details of an algorithm to the larger issues it illustrated, to yet larger lessons about how to be a scientist and a human being.”
 
A past president of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), Winston also wrote and edited numerous books, including a seminal textbook on AI that’s still used in classrooms around the world. Outside of the lab he also co-founded Ascent Technology, which produces scheduling and workforce management applications for major airports.
 
He is survived by his wife Karen Prendergast and his daughter Sarah.

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

With new technology available to us, we’re inching closer to the end of the days when deciphering ancient languages is a painstaking task filled with frustration and confusion. Nifty machines following complex algorithms are helping researchers around the globe as they take on the often monumental task of understanding ancient texts and lost languages.
Big Think reports that linguistic experts estimate there have been approximately 31,000 languages spoken throughout human history. Many of them are now dead and forgotten, but a new AI project may be part of the answer in how to decipher the writing of ancient languages.
How could something like this work? As Big Think points out:
“While languages change, many of the symbols and how the words and characters are distributed stay relatively constant over time. Because of that, you could attempt to decode a long-lost language if you understood its relationship to a known progenitor language.”



And that knowledge is the basis for the work of a joint team of researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab and the AI project called Google Brain. According to Discover Magazine the project team has ‘devised an algorithm that can begin to match words from unknown languages to related words, or cognates, in languages that share the same root.’ By using computing and linguistics advancements the project is make headway in creating algorithms that will help other researchers decipher ancient texts.

Exploring an Ancient and Undeciphered Language: Eteocypriot and the Amathus Bilingual Inscription

And while the algorithm hasn’t been applied to undeciphered languages such as Olmec, Linear A, or Proto-Elamite script yet, the researchers behind it have shown it’s an advance in translating texts that have enough examples to provide a decent dataset for the algorithms to work with. So far their work has focused on training the system with Linear B and Ugaritic – two ancient languages that have mostly been translated by other means in the past.

Working with Linear B and Ugaritic
Linear B is a script that was used by the Mycenaean civilization in the Late Bronze Age, 3000-plus years ago. It was first deciphered in 1953 by an architect named Michael Ventris. Ugaritic on the other hand is a cuneiform early Hebrew language that also dates back some 3000 years. It was first identified by French archaeologists in 1929.

To test the AI system, Big Think reports the researchers “focused on 4 key properties related to the context and alignment of the characters to be deciphered – distributional similarity, monotonic character mapping, structural sparsity and significant cognate overlap.”
It seems the effort was worthwhile because a report on the project states that: “When applied to the decipherment of Ugaritic, we achieve a 5.5% absolute improvement over state-of-the-art results. We also report the first automatic results in deciphering Linear B, a syllabic language related to ancient Greek, where our model correctly translates 67.3% of cognates.”

That means this could be a helpful tool for the researchers who want to speed up their work in studying these ancient scripts. While the creativity and understanding of past cultures is undoubtedly part of translation work – and something AI isn’t able to do yet – Big Think mentions the biggest plus to the new program “it can simply take a brute force approach that would be too exhausting for humans.” With the AI’s help, researchers “can attempt to translate symbols of an unknown alphabet by quickly testing it against symbols from one language after another, running them through everything that is already known.”





What Can AI Translation Teach Us?
By cracking the codes of ancient languages we will be able to gain much more insight into what life was like in ancient cultures. All sorts of insight could be gained on social, political, cultural, and everyday matters.
As technology keeps improving, it makes sense that researchers want to take advantage of it. Why spends hours upon hours painstakingly trying to compare the letters of the most distant with something more recognizable today when a machine can accomplish the same task in much less time (and with far less frustration)?

In December 2018, BBC reported that Émilie Pagé-Perron, a researcher in Assyriology at the University of Toronto, was “coordinating a project to machine translate 69,000 Mesopotamian administrative records from the 21st Century BC.”
As Pagé-Perron explained, even though we have garnered much information through archaeological digs and analysis, there’s still a missing element that can be filled in by translating ancient texts:





“We have information about so many different aspects of the lives of Mesopotamian people, and we can’t really profit from the expertise of people in different fields like economics or politics, who if they had access to the sources, could help us tremendously to understand those societies better.”

Jacob Dahl, a professor of Assyriology at the University of Oxford, says that “We have more sources from Mesopotamia than we have from Greece, Rome and ancient Egypt together.” But only 10% of the thousands of examples of tablets and seals have been deciphered – the problem is not the lack of texts to work with, but finding enough experts who can read it.
The BBC report states that the Pagé-Perron team are “training algorithms on a sample of 4,000 ancient administrative texts from a digitised database. Each records transactions or deliveries of sheep, reed bundles or beer to a temple or an individual.” And while Pagé-Perron admits that the standalone texts are less than exciting, she believes “they’re extremely interesting if you take them as groups of texts.”
Irving Finkel, curator of the 130,000 cuneiform tablets in the British Museum’s collection, provides even more of a reason for making these translations of Sumerian writing possible:
“Sumerian is probably the last member of what must have been a large family of languages that goes back thousands and thousands of years. Writing appeared in the world just in time to rescue Sumerian… We’re just lucky that we had some ‘microphone’ that picked it up before it went away with all the others […] It’s actually rather astonishing how interesting it is when you find a human mind across millennia, where it is like talking to them on the telephone. It’s the most exciting thing in the world when you meet one of these people.”

Finkel’s excitement is easily applied to other ancient cultures as well. Any ancient text translation may be the next big breakthrough in uncovering the biggest secrets in humanity’s past.
But that’s not to say that AI is anywhere near ready to take over for the good old-fashioned human creativity and social understanding that’s often needed to make the mental leaps that are necessary to making sense of old writing. For now, it’s just another amazing tool that can help researchers on the quest to make sense of what our ancient ancestors thought important enough to jot down or laboriously carve into tablets.

Many fear about the future of artificial intelligence and robotics. There are multiple factors supporting the claim that AI is in fact not a threat to humankind, but rather an advantage. One factor is that humans thrives off of social interaction and human communication, which robots evidently can’t provide. While online chatbots are a useful and efficient form of artificial intelligence, robots lack the necessary emotional connection to humans. In addition, while AI can replace certain human occupations, it also has the potential to increase job opportunities for people in the technology field. Lastly, as seen at Walmart, AI can improve the efficiency of employees without necessarily replacing them. Artificial intelligence is an amazing technological advancement and it isn’t a threat to humankind.Most humans partake in social interaction countless times per day. Whether it’s speaking with family members, meeting with colleagues or ordering food and drink at a restaurant, social interaction keeps humankind moving forward. A study published in 1997 by Lisa F. Berkman and S. Leonard Syme, discovered that “people who lacked social and community ties were more likely to die in the follow-up period than those with more extensive contacts,” emphasizing the need for social interaction. People need social interaction to live long, healthy lives — and artificial intelligence can limit this. While AI can easily replace humans in various customer service jobs, the potential for AI to replace humans in the business world and other occupations based on social interaction is much more limited.In addition to limiting social interaction, some fear that AI will replace many human jobs. Keith Block, author for The World Economic Forum, explains that advancements in the field of technology have historically created jobs. His claim is supported by various examples, such as “the advent of diesel, the internal combustion engine and electricity caused societal disruptions as workers moved from farms to cities, yet these innovations brought us Ford’s Model T, refrigeration, mechanised agriculture and an age of mass production that produced a new global middle class.” Keith suggests that while the structure of the job market may change, new jobs surrounding artificial intelligence will likely develop, as has happened in the past.While AI can pose a targeted threat to white collar jobs, it will eventually spark a new wave of job opportunities once the initiatives are in full swing. Box is an “enterprise content management platform” meaning they deal with “sharing and accessing files,” as well as “data retention and governance.” Due to the relevance of AI in that field, their chief product officer Jeetu Patel discussed artificial intelligence in an interview for Forbes, saying it will “enable workforces to spend more energy on deep thinking versus completing low value tasks like data entry. With work that can be automated, enterprises can redistribute talent resources and gain cost savings.” Overall, artificial intelligence will benefit humankind greatly without posing a threat to our society. AI will replace some tedious forms of labor will be replaced in the workplace, developing our society to be higher functioning and more successful. While there are many pros and cons to the integration of AI in the workplace, it will benefit humanity more than it will harm it. Maddy Piovano is a junior media arts and design major.
