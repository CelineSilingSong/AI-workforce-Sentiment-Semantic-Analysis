The women, mostly from the local Muslim community, are helping to train computer vision algorithms used in autonomous vehicles and augmented reality systems, for the likes of Amazon, Microsoft, eBay and TripAdvisor.
The all-female centre is one of eight Indian offices operated by iMerit, an India- and US-based data annotation company, whose 2,200 local employees label the oceans of data generated by industries as diverse as manufacturing, medical imaging, autonomous driving, retail, insurance and agriculture.
The operation is part of a growing data-labelling industry that employs hundreds of thousands of workers in lower-income countries including Kenya, India and the Philippines. 
Companies such as Figure Eight and Mighty AI, and more traditional IT companies such as Accenture and Wipro, are forming part of a so-called “AI supply chain” that creates algorithms able to interpret material including driving footage, search results and photos for the largest US and European multinationals, including Facebook, Volkswagen and Google.

Today
, companies are embracing artificial intelligence as a way to automate decision-making and help drive new business opportunities. The challenge is that the algorithms that underpin the technology are as naive as newborns. They need to be fed millions of labelled examples to teach them to “see”.

For a self-driving car algorithm to be taught the meaning of road signs, or to tell the difference between a child and a fox, hours of footage have to be watched and objects tagged, frame by frame. An hour of video takes eight hours to annotate. In fact, a McKinsey report from 2018 listed data labelling as the biggest obstacle to AI adoption in industry.







According to a January 2019 report by analyst firm Cognilytica, the market for third-party data labelling solutions was $150m in 2018, growing to more than $1bn by 2023. “The largest technology companies don’t want to be in the business of training data, they want to own customer relationships [and] are using partners and procurement wisely,” said Leila Janah, founder and chief executive of Samasource, a San Francisco-based data labelling vendor with offices in Kenya, Uganda, and the US.
“But this is why conversations around ethical AI supply chains are so vital to have now. Before it starts moving out of their four walls, we have to make sure we set the standards, and this market doesn’t go the way of apparel factories. There is a huge opportunity to ensure this [labelling] industry is a positive force.”
The new workforce
When large multinationals first started developing machine learning algorithms for consumer products, data labelling was either farmed out to gig workers via crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, or conducted in-house by teams of workers in low-wage economies. These contractors were often grossly underpaid compared with other employees at the same companies, and not afforded the same benefits, while their work was treated as menial, according to researchers such as Sarah T Roberts, who interviewed dozens of tech workers in countries such as the Philippines for her book Behind the Screen.

As the volume of data that requires labelling has expanded exponentially, large companies have increasingly turned to third parties able to supply workers who specialise in specific types of data such as driving or medical information — and who are also paid and treated in an ethical manner.
Samasource, whose employees label data for Walmart, Google, Microsoft, Glassdoor, Continental and General Motors, among others, is headquartered in Nairobi and employs more than 2,800 people. “We have a labour model that employs people as full-time workers with benefits, paid at a living wage.
On average, we almost quadruple our workers’ incomes [when we hire them],” Ms Janah said. “We work with a population usually coming from informal settlements, rural villages, so the chance to have a job that pays well, and gives you computer skills and exposes you to AI, it means people treat this very seriously.”
iMerit’s all-female training facility near Kolkata has become a specialist centre for computer vision labelling, and overall the company employs a 50 per cent female workforce, most from low-income families in India. “It’s a community where the women were not allowed to travel to go to work elsewhere. So we started bringing projects to them,” said Radha Basu, chief executive of iMerit. 
The human factor
AI supply chain companies insist that their work no longer involves mindless, rote labelling of basic objects such as cats, dogs and houses but has evolved into a far more specialised set of tasks. 
For instance, iMerit employees might analyse in-car footage of drivers, including facial expressions and eye blinks to determine driver fatigue; they have trained voice clips for Amazon’s Echo speaker to understand language and analysed satellite imagery of individual buildings and construction sites, to train risk assessment algorithms for insurance companies, Ms Basu said.

Samasource worked on a project for Bayer that required annotating vascular cross-sections of plants to detect diseased cells for crop protection, to train an aerial field image algorithm. Ms Janah explained: “We want to focus on complex edge cases that machines can’t easily grasp, where you need humans to provide nuance and judgment. That’s where we add value.”
As the AI training market starts to explode, western groups using AI are looking to work with more ethical outsourcing companies, with a social impact model. “For the first time, people are questioning the [labelling] companies that don’t guarantee a living wage to workers in the AI supply chain. As a company, if you’re getting your data trained by those labourers, you owe it to them to treat them fairly,” Ms Janah said.
Ms Basu said: “In the long run, these young rural, tribal workers will cause a real change in the economic empowerment of their communities.”

Looking into the future of AI



In 1987, the US series ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" introduces the Starfleet crew member Data, an AI in the form of an android. With the intellectual abilities of a human, Data worked based on parameters that allowed him to capture and analyze information. Subjective findings, intuition or social competences are not part of his system. Nevertheless, the figure strives to become more and more human-like through intensive training. For over 30 years, Data has embodied the vision of an intelligent machine – a strong AI that acts intelligently and flexibly on its own initiative.
Nowadays, that’s more than just a vision.
Research into AI was already ongoing as early as the 1950s.[1] One of its most famous representatives is Alan Turing, a British Mathematician who is known as the founder of the theoretical information and computer technology. In his paper “Computer Machinery and Intelligence”, published in 1950, he brings up the question of whether machines can simulate the human brain and act at the same level of intelligence.[2] The Turing Test, which he developed to test those capabilities, is still valid nowadays. But to date, no machine has passed this test.
Although there are many examples of so-called ‘weak’ or ‘narrow’ AI already being applied in everyday life – for example, in navigation systems, speech recognition, automated translations – these are primarily rule-based systems that use various methods to solve problems. The more advanced systems, such as voice assistants, self-driving cars or robots – such as those that are being developed by the American company Boston Dynamics – are still far away from the strong AI that can perform at the same level as a human brain. While we can learn facts independently using a few examples and transfer them to new problems, machines today must be trained with very large amounts of pre-structured data – this is known as ‘deep learning’.
All in all, the possibilities in the field of AI are far from exhausted.[3] Researchers are striving to create a form such as the fictional android, Data: a machine that finds its way around the world, continuously learns new things, and can transfer existing knowledge to new tasks.

Interview:  Dr. Helmut Linde, Global Head of Data Science & Analytics














Where do we stand today in the field of AI research? 



In recent years, AI research has made impressive progress in various fields – for example, in the recognition and synthesis of images or speech, in the motor control of machines, or in games such as chess or Go. Essentially, these advances are based on a special class of algorithms called deep learning. Its theoretical foundations are quite old and are based on ideas from brain research from the middle of the last century. However, the advances of recent years have been made possible by ever faster hardware and - thanks to the Internet - ever better access to huge amounts of training data. However, deep learning still has serious limitations: the dependency on training data, but especially the difficulty of transferring what has been learned into a new context.





















 
                                                            















What comes after Deep Learning?



I think that you have to completely rethink machine learning in order to overcome the previous limitations. On the one hand, we need input from the neurosciences - the neurosciences of the 21st century! - because so far, human or animal brains are the best proof that a physical living system can be much more intelligent than today's algorithms. On the other hand, we lack theoretical foundations: just as mathematicians have developed ""probability theory”, on which statistics are based, we need a ""theory of intelligence"" with which we can develop new algorithms. 











How far are we from an AI in the form of an android? Is it fiction or almost reality?



It is practically impossible to give a serious time estimate about it. Most experts agree that in principle it is possible to build such a strong AI. One can only speculate about when this will be achieved. But most AI researchers seem to think in decades rather than centuries, and I would agree.











How do they assess the social impact of successfully passing the Turing test?



The social impact will be greater than any other change humanity has ever experienced in its history. A strong AI could do almost any job at least as well as a human being and even much better. Furthermore, like any other software, it could be multiplied with very little effort. The potential of such a technology for economic and scientific progress is simply immeasurable. The big question is whether humanity will be able to use this power profitably for everyone. How will one distribute material abundance and secure the existence of those whose human labor is no longer needed? What are the psychological effects on society if most of its members no longer need to work? And is a strong AI even permanently controllable or do we have to fear that we will lose control over our technology?











To what extent do you at Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany contribute to current research in the field of AI and how do you cooperate with other institutions (beyond your organization)?



On the one hand, of course, we do applied AI research, i.e. we try to use or adapt existing algorithms cleverly in the context of our industry so that we can derive economic benefit from them. This involves, for example, automatically analyzing medical imaging data or finding new chemicals with certain pre-defined properties for our Electronics business. In addition, we are currently setting up a small research group that will deal with the basics of intelligence. In essence, we want to understand how an agent - a biological brain or an AI - can get an idea of its environment and how it can abstract from irrelevant details. For example: how does a child learn so quickly what a cat is, even though each cat looks a bit different and even the same cat is constantly perceived from different perspectives and under changing light conditions? It is said that the brain forms an ""invariant representation"" of the cat - a kind of data set that describes a cat ""in itself"" and is unchangeable - i.e. invariant - regarding the many unimportant details. How exactly this works, however, is completely enigmatic. Answering this question is probably an important and necessary step towards strong AI. We believe that experts from brain research, computer science, mathematics and theoretical physics need to be brought together to make progress. Various academic institutions can be interesting cooperation partners here, such as the TU Darmstadt or the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research in Frankfurt.











What do you find fascinating about your work?



I think that the phenomenon of intelligence is one of the most exciting topics of our time. You have to realize how impressively detailed and comprehensive the scientific worldview has become in the meantime. We can measure and understand things on time and size scales that are unbelievably far beyond our direct sensory perception. We can predict tiny elementary particles such as the Higgs boson on the basis of theoretical considerations and then prove them experimentally. The same applies to unbelievably massive and distant objects such as black holes and their gravitational waves. We measure cosmic background radiation that is over 13 billion years old and pulses from femtosecond lasers that last several millionths of a billionth of a second. We now also have a pretty good understanding of how living beings have developed in the more than 500 million years since the Cambrian explosion, and how the biochemistry of their cells works in the nanometer range. And then we have this 1.5 kg organ that we call the brain, that consumes just 20 watts of energy and that we constantly carry around with us - and we actually have no idea how it works...











How are we are using AI already?



From Siri to facial recognition, AI and machine learning are becoming familiar features of everyday life, transforming the way that we prevent, diagnose and treat different illnesses – as well as improving patient care. But they could also save lives, by helping find new and better treatments for disease, faster or by screening for diseases. 
The processes behind drug discovery can be challenging. Can AI and machine learning help alleviate some of the traditional bottlenecks, so we can get new and more effective drugs to patients, faster? Read our story how we are using AI for drug discovery. If you are interested in learning more about how we are enabling chemists to synthesize new compounds more efficiently, thus speeding up drug discovery so new medicines can reach patients sooner, than get to know SYNTHIA™, our AI based software. 

Medical robots, however, can help by relieving highly-skilled healthcare professionals from routine tasks. They can also perform highly accurate surgery, improve patient rehabilitation or target medicines specifically to where they are needed inside the body. Are medical robots with human-like characteristics about to change the way we diagnose medical conditions? Learn more about PETRA, the social medical robot who can screen for diseases!

Keeping these issues at the fore is key for Microsoft and OpenAI’s partnership, the companies said.“The technology industry in the last few years has not done a good enough job about thinking ahead of time about the impact that their work is going to have,” Altman said in a conversation with Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella. “So we want to make sure that the systems that we build are safe, understandable and most importantly, that the benefits of it are broadly shared.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementOpenAI was founded as a nonprofit in 2015, with $1 billion in backing from tech heavyweights like Musk, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and PayPal co-founder and Facebook board member Peter Thiel. Musk stepped down as chairman in February 2018, to “eliminate a potential future conflict” of interest, the company said in a blog post. Since then, OpenAI has restructured into a for-profit company so it can pursue the kind of financing necessary for such research, and to compete with giants like Google and Amazon.""The amount of money we needed to be successful in the mission is much more gigantic than I originally thought,” Altman told Wired. The San Francisco-based research lab has garnered mainstream attention with its projects, like a language modeling program that can take a prompt like a fake headline and use it to generate a convincing news article, complete with quotes and statistics.

The company’s facial recognition software serves police in the US, Australia, and France. Idemia software checks the faces of some cruise ship passengers landing in the US against Customs and Border Protection records. In 2017, a top FBI official told Congress that a facial recognition system that scours 30 million mugshots using Idemia technology helps “safeguard the American people.”Tom Simonite covers artificial intelligence for WIRED.But Idemia’s algorithms don’t always see all faces equally clearly. July test results from the National Institute of Standards and Technology indicated that two of Idemia’s latest algorithms were significantly more likely to mix up black women’s faces than those of white women, or black or white men.AdChoicesADVERTISEMENTThe NIST test challenged algorithms to verify that two photos showed the same face, similar to how a border agent would check passports. At sensitivity settings where Idemia’s algorithms falsely matched different white women’s faces at a rate of one in 10,000, it falsely matched black women’s faces about once in 1,000—10 times more frequently. A one in 10,000 false match rate is often used to evaluate facial recognition systems.Trending NowMachine Learning: Living in the Age of AIDonnie Scott, who leads the US public security division at Idemia, previously known as Morpho, says the algorithms tested by NIST have not been released commercially, and that the company checks for demographic differences during product development. He says the differing results likely came from engineers pushing their technology to get the best overall accuracy on NIST’s closely watched tests. “There are physical differences in people and the algorithms are going to improve on different people at different rates,” he says.Computer vision algorithms have never been so good at distinguishing human faces. NIST said last year that the best algorithms got 25 times better at finding a person in a large database between 2010 and 2018, and miss a true match just 0.2 percent of the time. That’s helped drive widespread use in government, commerce, and gadgets like the iPhone.But NIST’s tests and other studies repeatedly have found that the algorithms have a harder time recognizing people with darker skin. The agency’s July report covered tests on code from more than 50 companies. Many top performers in that report show similar performance gaps to Idemia’s 10-fold difference in error rate for black and white women. NIST has published results of demographic tests of facial recognition algorithms since early 2017. It also has consistently found that they perform less well for women than men, an effect believed to be driven at least in part by the use of makeup.Advertisement“White males ... is the demographic that usually gives the lowest FMR,” or false match rate, the report states. “Black females ... is the demographic that usually gives the highest FMR.” NIST plans a detailed report this fall on how the technology works on different demographic groups.NIST’s studies are considered the gold standard for evaluating facial recognition algorithms. Companies that do well use the results for marketing. Chinese and Russian companies have tended to dominate the rankings for overall accuracy, and tout their NIST results to win business at home. Idemia issued a press release in March boasting that it performed better than competitors for US federal contracts.Many facial recognition algorithms are more likely to mix up black faces than white faces. Each chart represents a different algorithm tested by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Those with a solid red line uppermost incorrectly match black women's faces more than other groups.
NISTThe Department of Homeland Security has also found that darker skin challenges commercial facial recognition. In February, DHS staff published results from testing 11 commercial systems designed to check a person’s identity, as at an airport security checkpoint. Test subjects had their skin pigment measured. The systems that were tested generally took longer to process people with darker skin and were less accurate at identifying them—although some vendors performed better than others. The agency’s internal privacy watchdog has said DHS should publicly report the performance of its deployed facial recognition systems, like those in trials at airports, on different racial and ethnic groups.The government reports echo critical 2018 studies from ACLU and MIT researchers openly wary of the technology. They reported algorithms from Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM were less accurate on darker skin.Most PopularThe Big StoryPriscila, Queen of the Rideshare MafiaBy Lauren Smiley, WIREDPoliticsTrump Shooting Conspiracies Are Coming From Every DirectionBy David Gilbert, WIREDPoliticsFar-Right Extremists Call for Violence and War After Trump ShootingBy David Gilbert, WIREDSecurityAT&T Paid a Hacker $370,000 to Delete Stolen Phone RecordsBy Kim Zetter, WIREDThose findings have stoked a growing national debate about the proper, and improper, uses of facial recognition. Some civil liberties advocates, lawmakers, and policy experts want government use of the technology to be restricted or banned, as it was recently in San Francisco and two other cities. Their concerns include privacy risks, the balance of power between citizens and the state—and racial disparities in results. Even if facial recognition worked equally well for all faces, there would still be reasons to restrict the technology, some critics say.Despite the swelling debate, facial recognition is already embedded in many federal, state, and local government agencies, and it’s spreading. The US government uses facial recognition for tasks like border checks and finding undocumented immigrants.Earlier this year, the Los Angeles Police Department responded to a home invasion that escalated into a fatal shooting. One suspect was arrested but another escaped. Detectives identified the fugitive by using an online photo to search through a mugshot facial recognition system maintained by Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Office.Lieutenant Derek Sabatini of the Sheriff’s Office says the case shows the value of the system, which is used by more than 50 county agencies and searches a database of more than 12 million mugshots. Detectives might not have found the suspect as quickly without facial recognition, Sabatini says. “Who knows how long it would have taken, and maybe that guy would not have been there to scoop up,” he says.“Having these systems work equally well for different demographics or even understanding whether or why this might be possible is really a long term goal.”Michael King, Florida Institute of TechnologyThe LA County system was built around a face-matching algorithm from Cognitec, a German company that, like Idemia, supplies facial recognition to governments around the world. As with Idemia, NIST testing of Cognitec’s algorithms’ shows they can be less accurate for women and people of color. At sensitivity thresholds that resulted in white women being falsely matched once in 10,000, two Cognitec algorithms NIST tested were about five times as likely to misidentify black women.Thorsten Thies, Cognitec’s director of algorithm development, acknowledged the difference but says it is hard to explain. One factor could be that it is “harder to take a good picture of a person with dark skin than it is for a white person,” he says.Sabatini dismisses concerns that—whatever the underlying cause—skewed algorithms could lead to racial disparities in policing. Officers check suggested matches carefully and seek corroborating evidence before taking action, he says. “We’ve been using it here since 2009 and haven’t had any issues: no lawsuits, no cases, no complaints,” he says.Concerns about the intersection of facial recognition and race are not new. In 2012, the FBI’s top facial recognition expert coauthored a research paper that found commercial facial recognition systems were less accurate for black people and women. Georgetown researchers warned of the problem in an influential 2016 report that said the FBI can search the faces of roughly half the US population.The issue has gained a fresh audience as facial recognition has become more common, and policy experts and makers more interested in the limitations of technology. The work of MIT researcher and activist Joy Buolamwini has been particularly influential.Early in 2018 Buolamwini and fellow AI researcher Timnit Gebru showed that Microsoft and IBM services that try to detect the gender of faces in photos were near perfect for men with pale skin but failed more than 20 percent of the time on women with dark skin; a subsequent study found similar patterns for an Amazon service.

Buolamwini told Congress that many datasets used by companies to test or train facial analysis systems are not properly representative. The easiest place to gather huge collections of faces is from the web, where content skews white, male, and western. Three face-image collections most widely cited in academic studies are 81 percent or more people with lighter skin, according to an IBM review.Patrick Grother, a widely respected figure in facial recognition who leads NIST’s testing, says there may be other causes for lower accuracy on darker skin. One is photo quality. Photographic technology and techniques have been optimized for lighter skin from the beginnings of color film into the digital era. He also posed a more provocative hypothesis at a conference in November: that black faces are statistically more similar to one another than white faces are. “You might conjecture that human nature has got something to do with it,” he says. “Different demographic groups might have differences in the phenotypic expression of our genes.”Michael King, an associate professor at Florida Institute of Technology who previously managed research programs for US intelligence agencies that included facial recognition, is less sure. “That’s one that I am not prepared to discuss at this point. We have just not got far enough in our research,” he says.King’s latest results, with colleagues from FIT and University of Notre Dame, illustrate the challenge of explaining demographic inconsistency in facial recognition algorithms and what to do about it.Their study tested four facial recognition algorithms—two commercial and two open source—on 53,000 mugshots. Mistakes that incorrectly matched two different people were more common for black faces, but errors in which matching faces went undetected were more common for white faces. A greater proportion of the mugshots of black people didn’t meet standards for ID photos, but that alone could not explain the skewed performance.The researchers did find they could get the algorithms to perform equally for blacks and whites—but only by using different sensitivity settings for the two groups. That’s unlikely to be practical outside the lab because asking detectives or border agents to choose a different setting for different groups of people would create its own discrimination risks, and could draw lawsuits alleging racial profiling.While King and others carefully probe algorithms in the lab, political fights over facial recognition are moving fast. Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle have promised action to rein in the technology, citing worries about accuracy for minorities. Tuesday, Oakland became the third US city to ban its agencies from using the technology since May, following Somerville, Massachusetts, and San Francisco.King says that the science of figuring out how to make algorithms work the same on all faces will continue at its own pace. “Having these systems work equally well for different demographics or even understanding whether or why this might be possible is really a long term goal,” he says.Enter your email to get the Wired newsletterclose dialogRecommended NewsletterFast ForwardA weekly dispatch from the future by Will Knight, exploring advances in AI and other technologies set to change our lives.

July test results from the National Institute of Standards and Technology indicated that two of Idemia’s latest algorithms were significantly more likely to mix up black women’s faces than those of white women, or black or white men.
The NIST test challenged algorithms to verify that two photos showed the same face, similar to how a border agent would check passports. At sensitivity settings where Idemia’s algorithms falsely matched different white women’s faces at a rate of one in 10,000, it falsely matched black women’s faces about once in 1,000—10 times more frequently. A one in 10,000 false match rate is often used to evaluate facial recognition systems.
Donnie Scott, who leads the US public security division at Idemia, previously known as Morpho, says the algorithms tested by NIST have not been released commercially, and that the company checks for demographic differences during product development. He says the differing results likely came from engineers pushing their technology to get the best overall accuracy on NIST’s closely watched tests. “There are physical differences in people and the algorithms are going to improve on different people at different rates,” he says.
Computer vision algorithms have never been so good at distinguishing human faces. NIST said last year that the best algorithms got 25 times better at finding a person in a large database between 2010 and 2018, and miss a true match just 0.2 percent of the time. That’s helped drive widespread use in government, commerce, and gadgets like the iPhone.
But NIST’s tests and other studies repeatedly have found that the algorithms have a harder time recognizing people with darker skin. The agency’s July report covered tests on code from more than 50 companies. Many top performers in that report show similar performance gaps to Idemia’s 10-fold difference in error rate for black and white women. NIST has published results of demographic tests of facial recognition algorithms since early 2017. It also has consistently found that they perform less well for women than men, an effect believed to be driven at least in part by the use of makeup.
“White males ... is the demographic that usually gives the lowest FMR,” or false match rate, the report states. “Black females ... is the demographic that usually gives the highest FMR.” NIST plans a detailed report this fall on how the technology works on different demographic groups.
NIST’s studies are considered the gold standard for evaluating facial recognition algorithms. Companies that do well use the results for marketing. Chinese and Russian companies have tended to dominate the rankings for overall accuracy, and tout their NIST results to win business at home. Idemia issued a press release in March boasting that it performed better than competitors for US federal contracts.
The Department of Homeland Security has also found that darker skin challenges commercial facial recognition. In February, DHS staff published results from testing 11 commercial systems designed to check a person’s identity, as at an airport security checkpoint. Test subjects had their skin pigment measured. The systems that were tested generally took longer to process people with darker skin and were less accurate at identifying them—although some vendors performed better than others. The agency’s internal privacy watchdog has said DHS should publicly report the performance of its deployed facial recognition systems, like those in trials at airports, on different racial and ethnic groups.
The government reports echo critical 2018 studies from ACLU and MIT researchers openly wary of the technology. They reported algorithms from Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM were less accurate on darker skin.
Those findings have stoked a growing national debate about the proper, and improper, uses of facial recognition. Some civil liberties advocates, lawmakers, and policy experts want government use of the technology to be restricted or banned, as it was recently in San Francisco and two other cities. Their concerns include privacy risks, the balance of power between citizens and the state—and racial disparities in results. Even if facial recognition worked equally well for all faces, there would still be reasons to restrict the technology, some critics say.
Despite the swelling debate, facial recognition is already embedded in many federal, state, and local government agencies, and it’s spreading. The US government uses facial recognition for tasks like border checks and finding undocumented immigrants.
Earlier this year, the Los Angeles Police Department responded to a home invasion that escalated into a fatal shooting. One suspect was arrested but another escaped. Detectives identified the fugitive by using an online photo to search through a mugshot facial recognition system maintained by Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Office.
Lieutenant Derek Sabatini of the Sheriff’s Office says the case shows the value of the system, which is used by more than 50 county agencies and searches a database of more than 12 million mugshots. Detectives might not have found the suspect as quickly without facial recognition, Sabatini says. “Who knows how long it would have taken, and maybe that guy would not have been there to scoop up,” he says.
The LA County system was built around a face-matching algorithm from Cognitec, a German company that, like Idemia, supplies facial recognition to governments around the world.

At sensitivity thresholds that resulted in white women being falsely matched once in 10,000, two Cognitec algorithms NIST tested were about five times as likely to misidentify black women.
Thorsten Thies, Cognitec’s director of algorithm development, acknowledged the difference but says it is hard to explain. One factor could be that it is “harder to take a good picture of a person with dark skin than it is for a white person,” he says.
Sabatini dismisses concerns that—whatever the underlying cause—skewed algorithms could lead to racial disparities in policing. Officers check suggested matches carefully and seek corroborating evidence before taking action, he says. “We’ve been using it here since 2009 and haven’t had any issues: no lawsuits, no cases, no complaints,” he says.

How to Balance Artificial Intelligence and Decision-Making in HR



By Steve Boese

July 26, 2019 

This is not the first time we have discussed artificial intelligence in the Inside HR Tech column, and it quite likely won’t be the last time. Judging by my unscientific but still reasonably accurate measure of the relative importance of an HR-technology topic or trend based on how much attention it received at recent HR Technology Conferences, I reckon that AI has emerged in the last five years as the single most discussed topic in HR tech. If it seems to you that everyone is talking or writing or speaking about AI in HR and in the workplace, you are pretty much correct. Even so, the topic feels so important for HR, for employees, for workplaces, that it may not (yet) be possible to pay too much attention to AI. That’s the conclusion I reached recently while reading some of the latest applications of AI technology in the workplace. Here are three themes on the issue.
RELATED: What’s coming up at HR Tech?
1. The Promise of Artificial Intelligence
My favorite explanation of AI and how it can be applied by organizations comes from the excellent book Prediction Machines: The Simple Economics of Artificial Intelligence by Ajay Agrawal, Joshua Gans and Avi Goldfarb. In the book, the authors lay out a simple model for decision-making and illustrate where and how AI tools affect decision-making. In short, a decision is simply choosing the best prediction of what might happen next, given a set of data and inputs, and applying our own judgment. They further explain that the power and benefit of AI technologies is that AI lowers the cost and increases the number of predictions available for us to select from.
Let’s take a common HR example: ranking a set of 1,000 applicants for an open job, with the decision being choosing which applicants to “short list” for additional interviews. A skilled recruiter could review all 1,000 applicants and create such a short list of the top eight to 10 applicants, but it would be extremely time-consuming. And as we have learned, even the best HR and recruiting professionals sometimes can miss important traits and characteristics, can fail to think expansively or creatively about applicants, and even can introduce unconscious bias into their evaluations and assessments.

Now let’s imagine this same process–ranking 1,000 applicants and creating a short list–supported by a powerful AI-technology solution. The AI can assess and rank the applications in a fraction of the time it would take a person, it can make connections between a person’s credentials and key success factors for the job, and it can ignore information about applicants that is inconsequential but often is the area where bias enters the process. In this case, the AI tool allows the recruiter to bypass the steps that are labor-intensive, lengthy and arguably better handled by the technology. The recruiter then can spend all of his or her time on the short-listed applicants, conducting meaningful interviews and determining which would make the best new hire. In an ideal world, this is a perfect example of how AI and people can work together to make the best HR decisions.
2. What if AI Goes Too Far?
But, if the above example is truly an ideal, we can also easily imagine a scenario where we allow the AI tools to perhaps go too far and take on too much of the responsibility for HR and decision-making about people. What if a recruiter permits the AI tools to create short lists of fewer candidates, thus missing the opportunity to interview some compelling candidates? What if the AI tool’s models are allowed to screen candidates and applications on an increasingly narrow set of characteristics and traits, also effectively artificially (pardon the pun) reducing the number of candidates who get to interview? Or finally, what if HR decides that the AI tool is so good at identifying the best candidate that it simply skips the short list and instructs the tool itself to send a job offer to the top-ranked candidate?

Do these scenarios seem unlikely? Maybe, but news already is being reported that some applications of AI technology in the workplace are crossing this fine line between technology on one side and human judgment and agency on the other. In one example, a report from the NNY360 site shared how an AI-powered “assistant” works with customer-service representatives in a large call center.
“When Conor Sprouls, a customer-service representative in the call center of insurance giant MetLife talks to a customer over the phone, he keeps one eye on the bottom-right corner of his screen. There, in a little blue box, AI tells him how he’s doing. Talking too fast? The program flashes an icon of a speedometer, indicating that he should slow down.
Sound sleepy? The software displays an ‘energy cue,’ with a picture of a coffee cup. Not empathetic enough? A heart icon pops up.
Sprouls and the other call-center workers at his office in Warwick, Rhode Island, still have plenty of human supervisors. But the software on their screens–made by Cogito, an AI company in Boston–has become a kind of adjunct manager, always watching them. At the end of every call, Sprouls’ Cogito notifications are tallied and added to a statistics dashboard that his supervisor can view. If he hides the Cogito window by minimizing it, the program notifies his supervisor.”
If Sprouls or other call-center reps attempt to minimize or close the Cogito AI assistant, the report goes on to state, their supervisor is immediately notified. Does the application of AI in this example for these workers seem like it has gone too far by effectively placing an AI technology in a constant, always-on, never-silent combination of supervisor, colleague and coach? Some would argue yes. But just the fact that these kinds of applications and use cases of AI tech exist, and are growing, reminds us that HR leaders need to think about these technologies and issues with growing attention and concern.
3. Finding a Balance Between High Tech and High Touch
These examples of applying advanced technologies like AI to support HR and individual decision-making remind us of something that sounds simple and obvious but will become more important as AI technology is infused in more HR-tech solutions and incorporated into HR processes. And that is this: We must endeavor to find and even create the appropriate balance between the responsibility and influence that we grant technology to inform decisions and the responsibility and ultimate authority over those decisions that we reserve for ourselves. We can’t be beguiled into allocating or ceding more of the decision-making processes in HR and talent to technologies until we are certain that these technologies truly are advancing our practice of HR and, more importantly, not diminishing what is more important and what is best about HR: our understanding of, concern for and empathy toward people.
In HR, we are not as lucky as, for example, our colleagues in finance or in supply-chain management, whose decisions are often and certainly much less centered on people. For the CFO, the decision of which set of short-term securities will generate the best return on the organization’s excess cash with an acceptable level of risk can be granted to an AI tool without much concern about the impact of a bad choice. But in HR we are not so fortunate.
Our decisions, all of them eventually, impact lives. Sometimes in small ways, like when we use an AI tool to set worker schedules, a tool that can’t “know” how important it might be for a retail worker to be able to have an afternoon off to see his child’s soccer game. And other decisions can impact people in much larger and more significant ways, like when we decide to use a tool like the call center AI, which hovers over reps tracking not just their work but always making suggestions and reporting their actions. It is our responsibility, in the end, to know the people impact of our decisions, even the ones that we allow the AI tools to make.

He also writes a blog and hosts the HR Happy Hour Show, a radio program and podcast.Sponsored ArticleWhat Does It Mean To Be Skills-First? Planning Your Skills RoadmapByBeamerySeptember 28, 2023The traditional approach to hiring (or redeploying) talent relies on assessing people based on their experience, education, and previous job titles. But many businesses are now starting to embrace a skills-first approach to talent management: the notion of focusing on the skills needed for particular tasks.Becoming a skills-first organization has risen up the business agenda. This means identifying the skills relevant to do the work, then matching people (with those skills) to the tasks at hand.“84% of business leaders think talent approaches need to reflect a focus on skills rather than traditional job roles.” (Source: Navigating The Changing Talent Landscape)The beauty of a skills-first approach is that it can be applied across the full talent lifecycle. With a single currency and common language for assessing candidates (as well as employees and alumni), HR teams and management can really understand the human capital that their business needs.Putting skills at the heart of your organization gives you many of the answers you need in response to the changing economic situation. It helps you become more agile and unlock greater productivity, while boosting diversity and enhancing employee engagement and wellbeing.‘Jobs’ vs. Skills: Why you need a unified skills taxonomyIncreasingly, it’s clear that we have been too limited in the way we look at work. Instead of trying to fit people to a fixed ‘job’, we should be focused on identifying what skills are needed to do the work. Forrester calls this ‘unbundling the job’: a more adaptive model to work, where elements of jobs are broken down into projects, gigs or tasks.Rather than focus on ‘jobs’, we focus on the problem to be solved or the ideal outcome – and then find the people with the skills, interests and capacity to get us there.A skills-based approach acknowledges that people are so much more than a job title. Or even one static job description. They have skills from previous roles, skills they picked up in other walks of life, and ‘adjacent skills’ that they could – with the right training – quite easily acquire. And they are keen to learn. As their skill sets grow, they can be deployed to new tasks or projects to meet business needs.A skills-first organization is therefore one that is incredibly agile and well set up to meet the needs of a changing world, and demanding workforce. So how do you build one?1. Create or enhance your skills taxonomyUnderstanding what skills you have – the potential in your organization and wider talent pipeline – and the skills you need, relies first and foremost on a unified skills taxonomy. Your organization must clearly define what skills truly ‘mean’ in your organization (including soft skills, technical skills, and behaviors), and then connect this to a dynamic job architecture.“Only 10% of HR executives say they effectively classify and organize skills into a skills taxonomy or framework—although nearly all (85%) have some efforts underway.” (Deloitte study)The skills taxonomy needs to be clear, dynamic, and interoperable with other systems and platforms.2. Manage your new taxonomy44% of business leaders told us that “better workforce data” was needed in order to enable a skills-first approach to talent – and 42% noted “more automation of HR processes” was required.This is where AI can help. With smart explainable AI tools, you can ensure skills are commonly defined and automatically connected between systems. AI can also infer what skills a person may have but not have listed; work out what skills they could potentially develop; and work out their seniority and proficiency, relative to industry context. Crucially, it can ensure people’s skills are updated as they learn new things – automatically.Make sure your new job architecture doesn’t become stale in a fast-changing world of talent.3. Start actioning valuable skills insightsA unified skills taxonomy opens up a whole new world of insights about your workforce – and your potential workforce. Understand where skills deficits are in the labor market. Shape your L&D strategy to re-train or upskill talent, in order to plug gaps. Compare what is happening in the external world and better prioritize acquisition activities, in order to build talent pools of those most-sought-after skills.Skills intelligence sits at the heart of improved internal mobility initiatives, for example: where employees and opportunities are matched together in a Talent Marketplace. Better internal mobility programs could massively impact retention in a tight talent market – and it’s impossible without good data and systems.Smart, explainable AI comes in here too. It can take the information about the skills of employees and use that to match them to suitable roles, or recommend training opportunities.And it’s amazing for workforce planning. With always-up-to-date skills intelligence, organizations can quickly identify where they have what they need to address new business priorities, respond quickly to new opportunities or challenges, and ensure that they have the right people in the right roles at all times.4. Connect the rest of your ecosystemAccording to Deloitte, 63% of HR executives say they are using “skills-related technology embedded in core HR information systems” – but just 33% say they have a single source of skills data across the entire workforce. If you’re going to be making important talent decisions about people based on skills, then that skills data needs to be verified and valid.Enabling talent agility requires combining capabilities across your talent tech stack – which may include an internal Talent Marketplace, Learning Experience platforms, your Talent CRM, an ATS, and so on – in order to connect talent supply to demand (skill needs and opportunities), on a continuous basis.This combination of skills intelligence and talent supply, within a truly holistic approach that looks at non-traditional as well as traditional talent pools, is what will enable true talent agility. As part of a total workforce strategy, a skills-first approach offers access to a wider pool of skills and expertise, including contractors, freelancers and other non-traditional workers.It’s a continued effort that is agile and iterative. People are motivated by the data that is leading them to new opportunities, they pursue those and build more experience, which leads to better data about people’s experiences, which feeds better matches between talent and opportunities in the future.A skills-based approach means cultural as well as technological changes. The roles of managers and leaders evolve from managing employees to orchestrating work and skills through projects, tasks, gigs, or problems to be solved; they need to be prepared and empowered to share talent more freely in the organization.Technology can work in the background to empower leaders to make better decisions with skills data. Employees too can get recommendations for new opportunities to upskill, within the flow of their work. The power of generative AI means that adopting the right technology for a skills-first approach doesn’t have to be arduous – it can be as simple as asking one question.The question for leaders is: are you ready to embrace this change?Learn more about becoming a skills-first organization by downloading our free report.

In fact, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) leads the Arab world with its adoption of artificial intelligence in other sectors and areas of life and has a government that prioritizes artificial intelligence including an AI strategy and Ministry of Artificial Intelligence with a mandate to invest in technologies and AI tools.
The Amazing Ways Dubai Airport Uses Artificial IntelligenceAdobe Stock

AI Customs Officials

The Emirates Ministry of the Interior said that by 2020, immigration officers would no longer be needed in the UAE. They will be replaced by artificial intelligence. The plan is to have people just walk through an AI-powered security system to be scanned without taking off shoes or belts or emptying pockets. The airport was already experimenting with a virtual aquarium smart gate. Travelers would walk through a small tunnel surrounded by fish. While they looked around at the fish that swim around them, cameras could view every angle of their faces. This allowed for quick identification.

AI Baggage Handling

Tim Clark, the president of Emirates, the world’s biggest long-haul carrier, believes artificial intelligence, specifically robots, should already be handling baggage service including identifying them, putting the bags in appropriate bins and then taking them out of the aircraft without any human intervention. He envisions these robots to be similar to the automation and robotics used at Amazon.com’s warehouses.
PROMOTED
Air Traffic Management
In a partnership with Canada-based Searidge Technologies, the UAE General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) is researching the use of artificial intelligence in the country’s air traffic control process. In a statement announcing the partnership in 2018, the director-general of the GCAA confirmed that it is UAE’s strategy to explore how artificial intelligence and other new technologies can enhance the aviation industry. With goals to optimize safety and efficiency within air traffic management, this is important work that could ultimately impact similar operations worldwide.
Automated Vehicles
Self-driving cars powered by artificial intelligence and 100% solar or electrical energy will soon be helping the Dubai Airport increase efficiency in its day-to-day operations, including improvements between ground transportation and air travel. Imagine how artificial intelligence could orchestrate passenger movement from arrival to the airport to leaving your destination's airport. In the future, autonomous vehicles (already loaded with your luggage) could meet you at the curb. Maybe AI could transform luggage carts to act autonomously to get your luggage to your hotel or home, eliminating any need for baggage carousels and the hassle of dealing with your luggage.
Staff Clearance
While much attention is given to the process of vetting passengers to ensure safe air travel, artificial intelligence can also improve the staff clearance process. Some airports see the most significant security threat airports, and airlines face is with airport personnel. An EgyptAir mechanic, baggage handler and two police officers were arrested in connection with the bombing of Metrojet Flight 9268 where all 224 people on board died. There have been several arrests in Australia of border force officers linked to international drug smugglers. Part of these efforts to improve the staff clearance process includes enhancing staff entrances to enable greater control with biometrics, advanced facial recognition and the use of artificial intelligence rather than just CCTV cameras and police monitoring which is used now. Artificial intelligence can look for areas of concerns with a staff member’s behavior and record for crime and violence even before they are hired. After they are hired, AI algorithms can continue to look for changes that could indicate a security problem.

AI Projects Being Explored for the Future
Emirates is developing AI projects in its lab at the Dubai Future Accelerators facility. Some of these include using AI to assist passengers when picking their onboard meals, scheduling a pickup by a taxi as well as personalizing the experience of every Emirates passenger throughout the entire journey. They are also exploring how AI can help Emirates teach cabin crew. We can expect that artificial intelligence will be put to work to solve the problems of airplane boarding by looking at the issue in a way humans have been unable to. The goal would be for AI to architect a queue-less experience.
AI at Other Airports
The first biometric airport terminal is already running at the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, and a similar system is running at Dubai International Airport for first- and business-class passengers. Here are some other ways airports and airlines around the world are using artificial intelligence or plan to:
·         Cybersecurity: Airports and airlines have shifted from identifying cybersecurity to preventing cybersecurity threats with an AI assist in response to the expansion of digitalization across aviation.
·         Immersive experiences: Augmented reality might be the future of helping travelers find their way through an airport.
·         Voice recognition technology: At Heathrow Airport, passengers can already ask Alexa to get flight updates. United Airlines allows travelers to check in to their flight through Google Assistant by simply stating, “Hey Google, check in to my flight.”
As innovation gets pushed by the UAE, Dubai International Airport and other technology innovators around the world, there will be opportunities for abuse and privacy considerations when using these new AI tools and capabilities for air travel. But, if artificial intelligence can remove the biggest headaches from travel, some people (possibly most) will be more than ready to exchange a bit of privacy for a better experience when AI takes over.

Kalifa·FollowPublished inTowards Data Science·7 min read·Jul 25, 2019209ListenShareSOURCE: © ADOBE STOCKThroughout history, we have seen how organisations across entire industries have embraced robotic technology, and how today, it is almost impossible for some of these organisations to operate without it. Every day, we are witnesses of how technology is integrating into nearly every aspect of our life at work, and in many cases, we depend on it to perform most of our daily tasks.Over many decades, organisations have been using robots to automate daily processes. In fact, every day we are surrounded by them, whether at home, in the street or at the office — from ATMs and vending machines to more sophisticated surgical robots and self-driving cars. These robots come in different forms and shapes, and perhaps they don’t look like humans, but the enterprise loves them, and they surely are a key driver for massive productivity.Now, imagine a regular day — wake up in the morning, go to your workplace, grab a coffee, and start a conversation with your colleague… Everything seems normal, you engage in the conversation, exchange thoughts and new ideas, then finish and move on to your desk to start working. An hour later, your manager asks you to analyse and compare five long reports. You don’t have time for that, it would take too many hours of work and tons of energy; plus there are other things that you have to do. So, you ask your colleague for help and amazingly get the results back within an hour.This sounds very unrealistic, right? No normal colleague would do this work for you or even finish it so fast. But what if I tell you that your colleague is a ROBOT? A robot that looks and acts the same as any other human being. It can talk like you, think like you, and almost reason like you do. But it is still a robot. How would you feel?SOURCE: © ADOBE STOCKArtificial Intelligence, Machine Learning & Robotics:Many robots are not artificially intelligent, they are programmed to perform repetitive tasks or movements to manipulate objects in the real world. However, some experts suggest that what constitutes a robot is its ability to think and make decisions, but doesn’t it imply the use of AI?On the other hand, Artificial Intelligence (AI) aims to replicate human intelligence behaviour by addressing skills like problem-solving, learning, perception, and reasoning. It can involve some level of Machine learning (ML), which is based on the idea of granting machines access to data that will allow them to learn by themselves.AI together with ML and Robotics intend to create a man-made machine/robot with human intellectual capacities that can be able to formulate original ideas by itself. We have not achieved this yet, but we have made a lot of progress.You have probably already heard about Sophia, the social robot that looks like a human. If you know what I’m talking about, think about a more sophisticated version of Sophia working and collaborating with humans.Other big developments include the so-called “Robotic Process Automation” (RPA). These are software robots that help businesses and employees do simple jobs by replicating human interaction. It is only a software and not a physical AI Robot, but this is definitely a significant breakthrough.The real challenge is to make AI understand how natural intelligence works because we know how our brain functions, and we can teach AI how to think and learn, but we still don’t know exactly how all these connections can lead AI to the use of abstract reasoning or “common sense”.SOURCE: © ADOBE STOCKMy Colleague is a Robot:Going back to where we started — robots designed to share a workspace with humans by carrying out physical and intellectual tasks, building up ideas with humans, learning from our environment, questioning decisions, and finding solutions together, will reduce many risks and exponentially increase productivity.Robots can already do many things much better than humans, but it still takes humans to interpret their work and apply the results in strategic and creative ways. For this reason, we need to make sure that robots are seen as complementary rather than competitive, and assign them the work that no one wants to do, the one that is intense and repetitive; leaving the part of the work that involves judgement and expertise, to humans.Imagine one more time, the same scenario where you engage in a conversation with your colleague, but now you know for sure and from the beginning that it is a robot. Would it feel weird?Probably, and I know it sounds scary as well, but if we give this deeper thought and think about the benefits and not the drawbacks of having an artificially intelligent coworker, it might just change our perspective. Some of these benefits include:Safety: Tasks that involve the use of heavy machinery, sharp objects, very high or low temperatures, chemicals, and others, will be performed by robots. This will protect workers in dangerous and unhealthy working conditions.Speed and Consistency: AI robots work fast and without any distractions, they have no need for vacations and are available 24/7.No Errors: Robots have almost no room for mistakes, they are precise and deliver quality.Happiness & Productivity: Most importantly, all these perks are intended to increase both, employee happiness and productivity. As mentioned before, these robots will take over those tasks that we don’t enjoy. From dangerous, tedious, and repetitive basic tasks to more complicated ones that require highly analytical skills.SOURCE: © ADOBE STOCKExamples of Work That Can Be Complemented By AI Robots:Data Journalists: This type of journalists are those who are focused on analysing data. AI robots could perfectly perform these work much faster and efficiently.Secretaries: Administrative tasks like answering phone calls, sending emails, scheduling meetings, and others (including physical, manual tasks), can be done by AI robots.Document-Review (Attorneys): Many attorneys have to search through thousands of documents looking for specific information. AI robots can filter information in a flash, they can also analyse it and generate reports. This work applies to other related fields as well.Pharmacists: When you go to a pharmacy, an AI robot could scan your prescription and get your medicine. For over-the-counter medicine, you could indicate your symptoms and the robot will suggest a recommendation. Also, these robots could potentially have access to data from hospitals and your health records to make suggestions more accurate.AI Police and Intelligence Assitant: AI Robots could potentially assist the police and agencies like the CIA by collecting, storing, sorting through, and highlighting key data that is necessary for investigations. They could also perform some physical duties like patrolling, arresting, and even directing traffic.Botenders: Robots can be taught how to mix and serve drinks. Anything from beers to signature cocktails. They can make hundreds of them within minutes.There are many concerns about robots replacing people and eliminating jobs, but these robots could potentially work alongside humans, collaborate and complement our work rather than taking over jobs. In fact, technology will create more jobs than it will eliminate. Many jobs will change, and the new ones will require a new set of skills that we must acquire through advanced education and training systems boosted by AI.If we are going to share a workspace with robots and see them as partners rather than adversaries, they must first experience the world as a human, meaning that they would need to be able to learn about us. This will make the interaction between humans and robots much easier and can also allow them to keep learning much faster.Morality and AI CoworkersWhat do we expect from artificially intelligent coworkers in terms of morality?SOURCE: © ADOBE STOCKAI and robotics will have a huge impact on society, values, and human rights.If we want machines to operate autonomously, at one point, they will require to collect a lot of data. But how much of these data do we want to share with robots? If a robot causes an accident, who would be responsible? Are we willing to give up our privacy to interact with robots? Can we even trust a robot?More questions will continue to arise as technology develops, and it is up to us to answer those questions by working together to implement a structure that regulates and protects the contour of these innovations.There are always two sides to every story, times of uncertainty will come and technology if gone wrong, can become dangerous. Therefore, we have to manage robots carefully, in the end, it is humans who will take charge of controlling, checking, and running the bots.AI and robotics should no longer be feared, but rather be seen as a tool for collaboration.",http://schema.org,NewsArticle,What if Your Colleague is a Robot - Towards Data Science,2019-07-25T18:38:42.327Z,2022-03-30T21:10:56.412Z,,,['https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*Ub2cnrd5rp2NP3CsbQNkag.jpeg'],"{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Emilio H.

But the Director of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Software Engineering at Intel, one of the world’s largest tech firms, is certain that by 2030 artificial intelligence will generate $13 trillion across the world. Abidi, who is originally from Lucknow, joined the chipmaker as a software engineer and is now responsible for deep learning framework software optimisation for Intel’s top of the line Xeon processors. “I was actually studying to be a doctor. But that was a long time ago and somehow it just ended there,” says Abidi who followed up her BS in pre-med and chemistry with an MS in computer science from the University of Massachusetts. Being responsible for optimising deep learning frameworks and workloads, Abidi now helps companies like Google, Facebook and Baidu iron out all areas where deep learning runs on Intel hardware. “My team works daily with Google. The optimisations we do get upstreamed to Google Tensorflow. Anybody downloading Tensorflow gets all the work my team has done.” On open source machine learning library, Tensorflow powers a lot of Google’s machine learning products like image recognition. Abidi’s portfolio is broad, straddling both the hardware and software sides of what Intel is doing in top-end computing. “On the hardware side, there are data centres and accelerators as well something like a compute stick. On the software side, which is my focus, we did so much work that it became at par with the competition,” explains Abidi, whose team came in for recognition for their work improving deep learning capabilities by 278 times. For someone who has been in the IT industry for well over two decades, the work on AI has been an eyeopener. “What I liked the best about AI is how people are building over each other’s breakthroughs. The models have been put on GitHub, papers are being shared, archive downloaded… I have not seen this before. Unbelievable,” she says, adding how everybody is coming together to standardise as much as possible. Abidi says her team’s work on Intel One API — a set of developer tools that provide a unified programming model — is an attempt to offer a solution so that everyone can collaborate more across different architectures. AI is nothing new, says Abidi, but now the coming together of data availability, cheap hardware and powerful algorithms have made this spurt possible. “So it is moving in a very good direction and that AI winter and all is gone. This is phenomenal and I’m really happy to be part of it. But if someone is hoping it to solve all those problems, then it is early.” But there are many projects that have given Abidi immense satisfaction. Like the work her team did to help Novartis process an image about 26 times larger than what the were used to in a matter of minutes and not days like before. Then there is the work on handheld devices that can detect diabetic retinopathy, as well as some image detection work that helped reduce poaching in Tanzania. For companies looking to add an artificial intelligence layer to their work, Abidi has a simple message: “Don’t do AI for the sake of AI, but do it so that it helps your business. So bake it into your underlying core and see how you can use it. And don’t reinvent the wheel.” She cites the example of Mujeeb Kolasseri from Palakkad in Kerala, a high school dropout who set up a business of tagging data from camera for clients all over the world to help machine learning. “That’s what I said about the kind of jobs that can be created.” “We have to be careful not to discard AI as a bad thing,” Abidi warns, underlining the ability of this new technology to “uplift mankind” in all areas.",,"{'@type': 'NewsMediaOrganization', 'name': 'The Indian Express', 'url': 'https://indianexpress.com/', 'foundingDate': '1932', 'ethicsPolicy': 'https://indianexpress.com/privacy-policy/', 'SameAs': ['https://www.facebook.com/indianexpress', 'https://twitter.com/IndianExpress', 'https://www.youtube.com/@indianexpress', 'https://www.instagram.com/indianexpress/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/indian-express/'], 'logo': {'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/11/ienewlogo3_new.png', 'width': '600', 'height': '60'}}","[{'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 1, 'item': {'@id': 'https://indianexpress.com/', 'name': 'News'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 2, 'item': {'@id': 'https://indianexpress.com/section/technology/', 'name': 'Technology'}}, {'@type': 'ListItem', 'position': 3, 'item': {'@id': 'https://indianexpress.com/section/technology/tech-news-technology/', 'name': 'Tech'}}]","['Home', 'Subscribe', 'India News', 'Cities', 'Videos', 'Audio', 'Explained', 'Education', 'Political Pulse', 'Opinion', 'Entertainment', 'Investigations', 'Lifestyle', 'Technology', 'Sports', 'Express Premium', 'Latest News', 'World News', 'Trending', 'Photos', 'Elections 2023', 'Web Stories', 'Bollywood', 'Cricket', 'Science', 'Business', 'Horoscope', 'Delhi News', 'Mumbai News', 'Hyderabad News', 'Bengaluru News', 'What Is', 'When Is', 'Who Is', 'How To', ""Today's Paper"", 'Brand Solutions']",,https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/behind-cutting-edge-artificial-intelligence-work-lucknow-woman-huma-abidi-who-set-out-to-be-a-doctor-5843297/,"{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/themes/indianexpress/images/indian-express-logo-n.svg', 'inLanguage': 'en-US', 'width': 600, 'height': 60, 'caption': 'The Indian Express'}","['https://www.facebook.com/indianexpress', 'https://twitter.com/IndianExpress', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/indian-express', 'https://www.instagram.com/indianexpress/', 'https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJEDFSxHHOW1PpBccdSxOTA']","{'@type': 'ContactPoint', 'telephone': '+91-120-6651500', 'areaServed': 'IN', 'availableLanguage': 'English', 'hoursAvailable': {'opens': '09:30', 'closes': '18:30'}}",,"{'@type': 'WebPage', '@id': 'https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/behind-cutting-edge-artificial-intelligence-work-lucknow-woman-huma-abidi-who-set-out-to-be-a-doctor-5843297/'}","{'@type': 'WebPageElement', 'isAccessibleForFree': False, 'cssSelector': '.ie-premium-content-block', 'video': [], 'audio': []}",,technology,,,,,,,"{'@type': 'SpeakableSpecification', 'xpath': ['//title', ""//meta[@name='description']/@content""]}",https://schema.org/NewsMediaOrganization,News,en,2024-07-16,"{'type': 'EntryPoint', 'urlTemplate': 'https://indexpress.page.link/shareDL'}",1932,JOURNALISM OF COURAGE,The Indian Express,"{'@type': 'PostalAddress', 'streetAddress': 'Express Building, B-1/B, Sector-10', 'addressLocality': 'Noida', 'addressRegion': 'India', 'postalCode': '201301'}","{'@type': 'Person', 'name': 'Ramnath Goenka', 'url': 'https://indianexpress.com/ramnath-goenka/', 'sameAs': 'https://indianexpress.com/ramnath-goenka/'}","{'@type': 'QuantitativeValue', 'value': 153}","{'@type': 'SearchAction', 'target': 'https://indianexpress.com/?s={search_term_string}', 'query-input': 'required name=search_term_string'}",2024,"{'@type': 'AdministrativeArea', 'name': 'Noida, India'}","{'@type': 'ImageObject', 'url': 'https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/07/huma.jpg', 'caption': '', 'description': 'Behind cutting edge AI work, Lucknow woman who set out to be a doctor', 'width': 1200, 'height': 675}"

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Data is crucial for business, but in order for it to be useful, there must not be any errors in collecting, processing and presenting that data. Artificial intelligence can monitor ETL processes to make sure they’re error-free.




ETL (extract, transform and load) is one of the most important processes in big data analytics — and simultaneously, it can be one of its biggest bottlenecks. (For more on big data, check out 5 Helpful Big Data Courses You Can Take Online.)
The reason ETL is so important is that most data a business collects is not ready, in its raw form, for an analytics solution to digest. In order for an analytics solution to create insights, the raw data needs to be extracted from the application where it currently resides, transformed into a format that an analytics program can read, and then loaded into the analytics program itself.
This process is analogous to cooking. Your raw ingredients are your raw data. They need to be extracted (purchased from a store), transformed (cooked), and then loaded (plated), before they can be analyzed (tasted). The difficulty and expense can scale unpredictably — it’s easy to make mac n’ cheese for yourself, but much more difficult to create a gourmet menu for 40 people at a dinner party. Needless to say, a mistake at any point can make your meal indigestible.
ETL Creates Bottlenecks for Analytics
ETL is in some ways the bedrock of the analytics process, but it also has some drawbacks. First of all, it’s slow and computationally expensive. This means that businesses often prioritize only their most important data for analytics, and simply store the rest. This contributes to the fact that up to 99% of all business data goes unused for analytics purposes.
In addition, the ETL process is never certain. Errors within the ETL process can corrupt your data. For example, a brief network error may prevent data from being extracted. If your source data contains multiple file types, then they might get transformed incorrectly. Garbage in, garbage out, as they say — errors during the ETL process will almost certainly express themselves in terms of inaccurate analytics.
A corrupted ETL process can have bad consequences. Even in the best-case scenario, you’ll probably have to re-run the ETL, which means a delay of hours — and in the meantime, your decision-makers are impatient. In the worst-case scenario, you don’t notice the inaccurate analytics until you’ve begun to lose money and customers.Advertisements




Streamlining ETL with Machine Learning and AI
You can — and probably do — assign someone to monitor ETL, but it’s honestly not that simple. Bad data can result from process errors that happen so quickly that they can’t be noticed in real time. The results of a corrupted ETL process often don’t look different from correctly loaded data. Even when errors are obvious, the problem that created the error may not be so easy to trace. (To learn more about analyzing data, see Job Role: Data Analyst.)
The good news is that machines can catch what humans can’t. These are just a few ways in which AI and machine learning can catch ETL errors before they turn into inaccurate analytics.
1. Detect and Alert Across ETL MetricsEven though your data is a constantly moving picture, the ETL process should still produce consistent values at a consistent speed. When these things change, it’s cause for alarm. Humans can see big swings in the data and recognize errors, but machine learning can recognize subtler faults, faster. It’s possible for a machine learning system to offer real-time anomaly detection and alert the IT department directly, allowing them to pause the process and remedy the issue without having to discard hours of computational effort.
2. Pinpoint Specific BottlenecksEven if your results are accurate, they might still come out too slowly to be of use. Gartner says that 80% of insights derived from analytics will never be harnessed to create monetary value, and that may be because a business leader can’t see an insight in time to take advantage of it. Machine learning can tell you where your system is slowing down and provide you with answers — getting you better data, faster.
3. Quantify the Impact of Change ManagementThe systems that produce your data and analytics are not static — they constantly receive patches and upgrades. Sometimes, these affect the way that they produce or interpret data — leading to inaccurate results. Machine learning can flag results that have changed and trace them to the specific patched machine or application.
4. Reduce the Cost of OperationsStalled analytics operations equal lost money. The time you spend figuring out not just how to solve the problem but also who is responsible for solving the problem is time you could be spending building value. Machine learning helps get to the heart of the matter by alerting only the teams that may be responsible for responding to specific kinds of incident, letting the rest of the IT department free to continue performing core job functions. In addition, machine learning will help eliminate false positives, reducing the overall number of alerts while increasing the granularity of information they can provide. Alert fatigue is very real, so this change will have a measurable impact on quality of life.
When it comes to winning in business, analytics is crucial. A landmark study from Bain Capital shows that companies employing analytics are more than twice as likely to overperform financially. ETL provides the foundation for success in this arena, but delays and errors can also prevent the success of an analytics program. Machine learning, therefore, becomes an invaluable tool for the success of any analytics program, helping to guarantee clean data and accurate results.
