AI’s major headwind is the cost of the investment, which will skew returns in the short-term. When the turnaround occurs, however, companies who are making the investment can expect to be rewarded disproportionately with a wide performance gap. In a recent report, McKinsey predicts AI leaders will see up to double the cash flow.

We can see some evidence of this in Alphabet’s revenue segment, Other Bets, which includes many AI projects with a loss of $3.35 billion in 2018. Of this, Deep Mind is responsible for $571 million in losses and owes its parent company $1.4 billion. The autonomous driving project, Waymo, had its valuation cut by 40% due to delays last September.


We see other companies taking on massive and expensive AI projects, such as Baidu, Facebook, Tesla, Alibaba, Microsoft and Amazon. Except for Tesla, these companies are flush with cash and can afford the transition costs and capital expenditures required for artificial intelligence.

Despite tech giants pouring cash into AI investments, most of the industries that stand to benefit are not in the tech industry, per se. This week, I attended Re-Work’s Deep Learning and AI Summit, where AI engineers and executives gathered for presentations and discussions about the projects they’re spearheading.

Here are a few ways that AI is slated to make an impact sooner rather than later:

2. Reducing Call Center Burden
United Health received 36 million calls in 2017 with 7.6 million calls transferred to a representative. The AI platform solution involves deep learning for a pre-check portal and claim queue, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to translate audio to text, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) for unsupervised clustering, to generate new call variables and automate transfer calls.

3. Retail Giants making Big AI Investments
Retail had a large presence at the conference with Wal-Mart Labs, Proctor and Gamble and Target presenting on ways they plan to make the retail experience more optimized. Perhaps these companies are being more careful to embrace technology and AI after the last decade ushered in many competitors who stole critical turf (i.e. Amazon).
Imagine a shopping experience where the carts are plentiful, cashiers are always open, and inventory is fully stocked. Rather than focus on replacing cashiers, Wal-Mart is more focused on inventory control. This is a different approach than competitor Amazon Go, designed to be cashier-less.
4. AI Could Be the Answer to Restoring Privacy
Privacy has been in the headlines lately as regulators and social media users begin to question what is a fair exchange for a free service. While the battle is nearing two years since Cambridge Analytica, other companies are creating AI recommendation engines so powerful that little information is needed about the person making the choice; their preference is enough to determine what to recommend next.
Netflix is a leader here with its recommendation engine for content. Pinterest also employs a complex recommendation engine to surface the best image for an individual out of the billions of images on Pinterest’s platform. This is done through the process of query understanding to candidate generation to ranking to blending to the final result. In layman’s terms, this is how a discovery engine narrows down choices from billions to hundreds.
5. Prepare to Be Blown Away by AI-Assistants
Over the next few years, we will become hands-free and will have better posture and fewer car accidents. Once AI-assistants are fully built out, our interaction with mobile devices may become the brunt of criticism from future generations. Many companies are working to own this space as the ecosystem lock-in and data produced by AI-assistants will be incredibly valuable – expect a full-fledged battle between Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple in this space.

Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesRebecca Heilweil covered emerging technology, artificial intelligence, and the supply chain.The British startup Exscientia claims it has developed the first medication created using artificial intelligence that will be clinically tested on humans. The medication, which is meant to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder, took less than a year from conception to trial-ready capsule. Human trials are set to begin in March, but would you take a drug designed using artificially intelligent software?The appeal of AI-designed drugs is relatively straightforward. There are lots and lots of possible molecules that might be useful in medications, far too many for all the medical researchers in the world to manually test. But by using different types of AI, a computer system can come up with and mine through different molecules, comparing them against different parameters and learning the most promising compounds faster than a human could. Artificial intelligence is certainly powerful, but some are skeptical that the technology is reliable or trustworthy, and question what role it should play in areas like our health care. And in drug research, some have voiced concerns that the technology might be overhyped, and that AI’s findings may not be as groundbreaking as we’d like to believe.Exscientia’s CEO, Andrew Hopkins, has argued that AI means synthesizing fewer compounds for testing and running fewer experiments in the search for a new medication. “Active Learning [a subcategory of a type of artificial intelligence called machine learning] algorithms automatically prioritise the most informative compounds for experimental synthesis and testing and enable the system to learn faster than humans alone,” Hopkins told Recode in an email. Of course, AI could be used for more than just trying to come up with new compounds. The technology could also mine through scientific research and patient data and help inspire the repurposing of old drugs, among a wide variety of other applications. And the uses can be even broader than just medication: Researchers have used AI to track the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus, and the technology is also being deployed to tackle the American opioid crisis.Hopkins went on to explain that his company’s platform is the first to have produced a drug with artificial intelligence that will be tested in a clinical trial. He says the compound that was ultimately produced — called DSP-1181— is expected to last longer and have a stronger efficacy than other existing medications for OCD. Japanese pharmaceutical company Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma, which owns the rights to the drug, will oversee its clinical development. The first phase of human trials, which will test the medication’s safety and the body’s response to it, will also take place in Japan. As remarkable as the new drug’s development seems, there’s still room for some healthy skepticism. Artificial intelligence can help us find new molecules, but there’s a chance that the molecules found by AI will ultimately resemble molecules we’ve already studied. That’s the caution of chemist Derek Lowe, a researcher at Novartis who works on drug discovery. On his pharmaceutical industry blog, Lowe explains how simply finding a potential compound doesn’t guarantee that scientists actually understand the biochemical nature of the illness they’re trying to treat — or that the drug will even work. “The problem is that preclinical drug optimization is not the problem,” he wrote of Exscientia’s announcement. “This project, at best, seems to me to have saved a few months off the process of sending their compound into the same black-box shredder as every such drug project goes into when it hits human trials.”Meanwhile, the development of AI-assisted pharmaceuticals raises questions about how comfortable people should be with these new research methods. In the long run, how will AI-designed drugs differ from those developed by humans alone? Who should make the rules for the use of AI in drug research?Like all applications of artificial intelligence, health authorities are trying to figure out how best to study and regulate these tools. While the Food and Drug Administration wouldn’t comment on this particular new drug, FDA spokesperson Jeremy Kahn told Recode that the agency is committed to maintaining public health standards — while also protecting innovation — and that its drug evaluation and research center is assessing the regulatory considerations that AI tools might raise.“The full role of AI in drug development is still being elucidated, and stakeholders understand AI in different ways considering the spectrum of tools and techniques covered under this umbrella term,” Kahn told Recode in an email. “Importantly, the evidentiary standards needed to support drug approvals remain the same regardless of the technological advances involved.”Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Exscientia said the drug had to meet the same requirements as any other drug undergoing a phase I trial in Japan.It’s essential to remember that Exscientia and other pharmaceutical companies stand to make a lot of cash if AI-based drug development actually works. The number of investments major biotech investments are dropping on the technology suggests as much.Large pharmaceutical companies are increasingly throwing money behind artificial intelligence, and Exscientia, whose investors include the German drug company Evotec and Bristol-Myers Squibb, is working with several drug giants on new drugs, including Bayer and GlaxoSmithKline.So you might not have the opportunity to try a drug designed by artificial intelligence in the next few months — unless you’re one of the select humans that will try this new drug in Japan. Still, this recent development brings us closer than ever to a future where AI designs new drugs. Will they actually aid our ailments any better than good old-fashioned human-made drugs?

Why are we so scared of Artificial Intelligence development?

January 30, 2020 



 




© Kittipong  Jirasukhanont 
Nikolas Kairinos, CEO and Founder, Fountech.ai discusses the ethical and safety issues of Artificial Intelligence development if it is to be misused by society
The proliferation of technology throughout society has been rapid. As with any kind of societal shift, it has led to the excitement for the future and concern around new risks; particularly when it comes to job security. Indeed, academic institutions such as the University of Oxford suggesting that 47% of the current job market will be made obsolete due to rapid advancements in tech over the next 25 years have done nothing to calm public nerves.
Such staggering numbers are inevitably eye-catching, but not always helpful. Indeed, they tend to result in black hole baseless panic. As German philosopher Immanuel Kant suggested, it is within human nature to “project things to infinity”, regardless of the evidence.
Humans will always be needed
Thankfully, a growing body of evidence indicates the future relationship between tech and humanity will be prosperous and peaceful. That’s partly because humans have some innate qualities that will be difficult for machines to ever replicate, meaning we will always be needed for the proper operation of society.
This view is supported by the experts; the World Economic Forum has predicted that whilst 75 million jobs could be lost to tech between 2020 and 2025, a further 133 million new roles will be created. These will be in the maintenance, management and oversight of the tech jobs, many of which are yet to be created
Pedros Domingos, a professor at the University of Washington and expert on the future relations between man and machine, suggests that AI will lead to the creation of roles that we cannot yet understand. After all, if you asked a person in the 1980s to describe the role of an app developer, they’d be uncertain. Indeed, this is the case for those of us today trying to imagine the world of work in 2030 or 2050 — there are too many variables for us to make an effective prediction. One thing is sure: there’ll be new jobs for people to fill.
Complimentary skillsets
However, the new jobs created won’t just be about creating and maintaining the new technology – this will partially make up the job creation, of course, although newly carved human roles in the future workforce will involve working with machines.
This refers to how AI will be able to augment and complement, rather than replace, what humans are already able to do. A fantastic example comes from Prospex. This tech, developed by Fountech Ventures, is an AI program that can generate leads for salespeople. So, rather than spending hours manually trawling through databases to find business leads, the technology rapidly compiles lists of people to contact. As such, salespeople can focus on their passion, amplify their skills and delegate all of the drudgery to a machine.
Another example arrives from Autodesk, who have developed an AI program called ‘Dreamcatcher’. It too has a simple proposition: generating new designs based on assigned parameters. So, if you were designing a new table, you’d input code for ‘legs’, ‘tabletop’, etc., and it then generates a multitude of options based on the designer’s preferences. The latter is then able to choose or amend a design as needed. So, we see human creativity flourish, thanks to collaboration with AI technology.
More enjoyable tasks
The future collaboration between man and machine will also be characterised by a more obvious aspect: the automation of repetitive tasks. For the millions of people worldwide who still work in factories, this might be a worrying prospect. However, the reality is more complex and, indeed, positive.
In fact, it will likely entail more fulfilling roles and the example of chatbots illustrates this point clearly. They are able to access vast amounts of data and are usually positioned at the beginning of the customer contact experience. Here, they answer questions and direct customers to call centres, where a specialised, human response can be given if needed. For the customer, it means a more efficient service. And for workers, it means dealing with more interesting issues — rather than asking ‘what is your customer reference?’ all day — certainly a ‘win-win’.
John E. Kelly III, executive vice president at IBM asserted that, collaboratively, humans and machines “working together always beat or make a better decision than a man or a machine independently” – and I agree. As long as experts treat this new technology with care, there will be no limit to what man and machine can collectively achieve.

AI is coming for managers' jobs says Gartner







Companies will need to completely overhaul long-held ideas about managers’ roles as a new analysis suggests the rate of Artificial Intelligence driven job losses is accelerating.
Gartner research released last week predicts artificial intelligence algorithms could take over 69 percent of the routine work currently done by managers.
Concerns about ever-better AI obviating the need for workers are nothing new, but early analyses suggested knowledge workers would be safer than process workers because AI lacks the human intuition required for effective decision-making.
Yet the degree of anticipated job replacement has increased over time as technology improves. In 2017 a McKinsey & Company analysis, for example, predicted half of current work activities could be automated by 2055.
Up to a third of the workforce would need to retrain for other jobs – although Australian workers were safer than those in many other countries, with 45 percent of Australian jobs up for grabs but positions in sectors like retail, hospitality, manufacturing, educational services, and mining flagged as having below-average automation potential.
Jobs on the line
Last year, one AI expert predicted new decision-making technologies would potentially eliminate 40 percent of jobs within 15 years – with Western Australian innovator Fastbrick Robotics a classic example by developing a robot that can lay 1000 bricks per hour.
Yet Gartner’s latest analysis moves up the timeline significantly, sounding a death knell for people in slow-changing jobs that require a low degree of ‘social-creative skills’ – think white-collar roles like computer programmers, accountants and lawyers.
One site measuring the risk of automation suggests 94 percent of accountant and auditor jobs, 56 percent of teacher assistants, 48 percent of computer programmers and 25 percent of managers were at risk from automation.
Jobs requiring more social-creative skills, such as marketing managers, sales representatives, and customer service representatives, needed to be trained to have more “digital dexterity”, Gartner said, because “chances are high that new technologies to support work will be introduced”.
You will be assimilated
Whatever the numbers, the consensus AI is coming for your job has created an uncomfortable reality: Many workers assume technological displacement is inevitable, but those same workers assume the displacement will happen to people in other jobs.
Public dread about AI had led many managers to become “wary” of introducing AI because of widespread concerns about job losses, Gartner noted, but restraint would become increasingly difficult as cost-savings calculations tipped in favour of automation’s “significant” benefits.
Companies could save an average $7m ($US5m) per 1000 employees or 100 managers, Gartner predicted, as activities such as administrative tasks, project management, team management, and development of direct reports are replaced by technologies like expense management, automated project status dashboards, algorithmic management platforms, and real-time chatbot interventions, respectively.
“The role of manager will see a complete overhaul in the next four years,” Gartner research Vice President Helen Poitevin said.
“Currently, managers often need to spend time filling in forms, updating information and approving workflows. By using AI to automate these tasks, they can spend less time managing transactions and can invest more time on learning, performance management and goal setting.”
Companies would need to embrace a number of ‘necessary’ technology advances including increased use of automated decision management, embedded analytics, AI-driven internal talent marketplaces, and transformation of application logic in manager-centric human capital management systems.
Machine learning would replace anomaly detection in work schedules, time and attendance, expenses, and “other processes where managers have been given oversight tasks”.
Look on the bright side
Managers will likely face the axe as automation makes many of their functions redundant, but those that remain will also need to drive change in organisational learning for another quite specific reason.
As increasing automation kills off many jobs and reduces the number of task-based activities that managers perform, Gartner warned, on-the-job learning opportunities would be cut by two-thirds.
This would mean that workers would no longer be able to learn by watching and doing, forcing companies to overhaul long-established mentorship and training structures based around the idea of on-the-job training.
By 2025, automation would have driven so much organisational change that 47 percent of learning and staff development budgets would simply be wasted, Gartner predicts – with learned skills relevant for increasingly short periods and digital dexterity a crucial measure of organisational adaptability.
Yet skills are not perfectly transferrable and companies must think big when it comes to retraining: If workers can’t reskill to crabwalk into AI-protected jobs, they may end up unemployed despite organisational efforts.
Revolutionising the workforce
Despite the potential disruption it will cause, Gartner believes AI will also revolutionise the workforce by empowering disenfranchised workers such as people with disabilities – where a 69 percent US unemployment rate continues to constrain the pool of potential skilled workers.
AI will reduce barriers to access for this workforce, the analysis concluded, predicting that AI would help triple the number of people with disabilities employed by 2023.
This would have flow-on effects for the companies, with organisations actively employing people with disabilities said to have 89 percent higher retention rates, 72 percent higher employee productivity and 29 percent higher profitability – generating goodwill that “should provide some reputational protection” for companies suffering “adverse actions, such as layoffs”.
Whether that goodwill can save the modern workforce remains to be seen – but AI’s push into the knowledge economy will nonetheless continue unchecked.

What is a Chatbot?You've likely talked to a robot already without even knowing it. And you might have even heard the term ""chatbot"" in the news. But what is a chatbot? How do chatbots work?








                                  A chatbot is just a robot chat that imitates human conversations through voice commands, text chats, or both.

Essentially, a chatbot is just a robot chat that imitates human conversations through voice commands, text chats, or both. It's a virtual conversation in which one party is an online talking robot.The artificial intelligence feature within talking robots has been used in various industries to deliver information or perform tasks, such as telling the weather, making flight reservations, or purchasing products.Chatbot TechnologyInside the artificial intelligence of a chatbot is machine learning and what's known as natural-language processing (NLP). Machine learning can be applied in different fields to create various chatbot algorithms, while NLP has the ability to pick up conversational cadences and mimic human conversation.








                                  Inside the artificial intelligence of a chatbot is machine learning and what's known as natural-language processing.

The chatbot is trained to translate the input data into a desired output value. When given this data, it analyzes and forms context to point to the relevant data to react to spoken or written prompts. Looking into deep learning within AI, the machine discovers new patterns in the data without any prior information or training, then extracts and stores the pattern.This machine learning algorithm, known as neural networks, consists of different layers for analyzing and learning data. Inspired by the human brain, each layer is consists of its own artificial neurons that are interconnected and responsive to one another. Each connection is weighted by previous learning patterns or events and with each input of data, more ""learning"" takes place.How Chatbots Got SmarterWith the advancements in artificial intelligence and the rapid growth of messaging apps, chatbots are becoming increasingly necessary in many industries. Although bot technology has been around for decades, machine-learning has been improving dramatically due to the heightened interest from key Silicon Valley powers.

Natural language processing mimics human speech patterns to simulate a human tone in computer-human interaction, which creates more intimate interactions. The predictive analytics within bots uses statistics, modeling, data mining and more to generate information proactively, rather than in response to a prompt.The sentiment analysis in machine learning uses language analytics to determine the attitude or emotional state of whom they are speaking to in any given situation. This has proven to be difficult for even the most advanced chatbot due to an inability to detect certain questions and comments from context. Developers are creating these bots to automate a wider range of processes in an increasingly human-like way and to continue to develop and learn over time.An indicator of just how human-like these machines can be was actually developed in the 1950s by British scientist Alan Turing. His Turing Test checks the presence of mind, thought, or intelligence in a machine and if it can fool a human to believe that it is a human as well, then it passes the test.There was a time when even some of the most prominent minds believed that a machine could not be as intelligent as humans but in 1991, the start of the Loebner Prize competitions began to prove otherwise. The competition awards the best performing chatbot that convinces the judges that it is some form of intelligence. But despite the tremendous development of chatbots and their ability to execute intelligent behavior not displayed by humans, chatbots still do not have the accuracy to understand the context of questions in every situation each time.Chatbots Uses of Today and Tomorrow

Walton doesn’t blame the cuts on a computer; he blames them on the company’s top executives, whose “coldblooded, calculated move” cost people their jobs.It “ripped my [expletive] heart out,” Walton said. “The people at the top don’t know who we are at the bottom. They don’t understand the relationships and the connections we had with the communities. And that’s the worst part: They don’t care.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThe dominant player in U.S. radio, which owns the online music service iHeartRadio and more than 850 local stations across the United States, has called AI the muscle it needs to fend off rivals, recapture listeners and emerge from bankruptcy. The company, which now uses software to schedule music, analyze research and mix songs, plans to consolidate offices around what executives call “AI-enabled Centers of Excellence.”💻Follow TechnologyFollowThe company’s shift seems in line with a corporate America that is increasingly embracing automation, using technological advances to take over tasks once done by people, boosting profits and cutting costs.

They excel at some tasks but still depend heavily on people for training, refinement and repair. Some critics say executives end up using the systems as scapegoats, hoping to distract from old-school failures, portray themselves as futuristic and avoid public outrage.GET CAUGHT UPStories to keep you informedPreviousNextDissenting Republican delegates sign protest of Trump platform SparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.U.S., Germany foiled Russian plot to assassinate CEO of arms manufacturer, officials saySparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.Family of teen who died after ‘One Chip Challenge’ sues snack companySparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.La Niña is coming.

Here’s what renters should know.SparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.Industry analysts and observers said iHeartMedia had begun highlighting its AI bets in hopes of persuading investors it had the technological wherewithal to survive a new musical age in which digital streaming services compete against over-the-air radio for advertising dollars and listeners’ time.Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich said iHeartMedia’s leadership — including Pittman, who she said could “sell ice to an Eskimo” — had successfully built the company’s stature in the face of heavy debts. While the job cuts may sound “inhumane,” she added, they made sense from a Wall Street perspective, given the company’s need to trim costs and improve its profit margins.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“There’s definitely room for efficiency,” she said. “There’s no reason AI couldn’t help.”But shrinking the workforce, said Jerry Del Colliano, a music-business professor at New York University who publishes the industry newsletter Inside Music Media, looked less like a necessary shift to ultramodern tech and more a response to iHeartMedia’s past struggles and future risks: what Goldman Sachs analysts in October called the “rising competitive intensity” and “cannibalization” of audio rivals on the Web.Perspective: Blame the policies, not the robots“This is a typical example of a dying industry that is blaming technology for something that is just absolutely a reduction in force,” Del Colliano said. “It’s a bum rap for AI. It’s an excuse. We’ve got to get out of the habit of looking at AI or any other technology as simply a way to fire people.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementiHeartRadio spokeswoman Wendy Goldberg declined to make executives available for comment or provide a total layoff count, saying only that the job cuts were “relatively small” compared with the company’s overall workforce of 12,500 employees.But half a dozen DJs who spoke with The Washington Post said the cuts were tantamount to a “bloodbath.” Informal lists compiled by industry news sites such as RadioInsight provide the names of hundreds of talk show hosts, news anchors, producers, program directors, reporters and drive-time DJs let go from local stations across the country. Del Colliano estimated that more than 1,000 people would lose their jobs nationwide.The cuts, Goldberg said, showed how iHeartMedia was shifting “jobs to the future from the past,” adding data scientists, podcast producers and other digital teams to help transform the radio broadcaster into a “multiplatform” creator and “America’s #1 audio company.”“We do not intend to be one of those companies that stayed in the past, and the world passed it by,” Goldberg said in a statement. “Change is painful and change is hard — but consciously choosing not to change is not an option for a company that is going to continue to grow and compete.”Broadcast radio has been bulldozed by online upstarts such as Pandora, Spotify and YouTube, but the long-running medium remains a huge business. In November, iHeartMedia reported it took in more than $1.6 billion in broadcast-radio revenue during the first nine months of 2019, and company filings claim that a quarter of a billion listeners still tune in every month to discover new music, catch up on the news or hear from their local DJs.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementExecutives at the Texas-based company have long touted human DJs as their biggest competitive strength, saying in federal securities filings last year that the company was in the “companionship” business because listeners build a “trusted bond and strong relationship” with the on-air personalities they hear every day.“Consumers listen to the radio because the voice on the other side sounds like a friend,” the filing said.But the company has also tried to combat its online rivals, many of which recommend songs based on a user’s listening history, by hyping up its newfound technological power. In 2018, some stations on the online iHeartRadio service began testing a music-mixing AI system built by the start-up Super Hi-Fi, which says it can “understand music nuances with the same depth as a human DJ.”A face-scanning algorithm increasingly decides whether you deserve the jobThe system can transition in real time between songs by layering in music, sound effects, voice-over snippets and ads, delivering the style of smooth, seamless playback that has long been the human DJ’s trade. The Los Angeles-based Super Hi-Fi, whose clients also include the streaming fitness service Peloton, says its “computational music presentation” AI can help erase the seconds-long gaps between songs that can lead to “a loss of energy, lack of continuity and disquieting sterility.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementSuper Hi-Fi patents filed last year reduce the art of mixing music to a diagram of algorithmic tasks: The “MagicStitch” system, as Super Hi-Fi calls it, assesses songs’ “rhythmic profile, chordal, melodic content, harmonic and amplitude over time”; calculates ways to blend them “in concordance with the salient temporal moments”; then interjects other elements to create a “more engaging overall consumption experience.”The system is trained to process different stylistic touches — “a ‘wild and crazy’ classical piece will differ greatly from a ‘wild and crazy’ punk rock anthem,” one patent states — as well as their energy level and mood, from “bouncing off the walls” to “dirge.” Sentiment is also catalogued, the company said, “so as not to put a super-positive announcer over a super-negative piece of content,” like a grim piece of breaking news.In a demonstration for a Post reporter, Super Hi-Fi co-founder Zack Zalon showed the system transitioning from Nicki Minaj’s “Anaconda” to Kanye West’s “Stronger”: One song wove cleanly into the other through an automated mix of booming sound effects, background music, interview sound bites and station-branding shout-outs (“Super Hi-Fi: Recommended by God”). The smooth transition might have taken a DJ a few minutes to prepare; the computer completed it in a matter of seconds. (“3,526 Calculations Performed,” the system declared afterward.)The Technology 202: Workers in heartland states most at risk of losing jobs to AI, new study findsMuch of the initial training for these delicate transitions comes from humans, who prerecord voice-overs, select songs, edit audio clips, and classify music by genre, style and mood. Zalon said the machine-learning system has been further refined by iHeartMedia’s human DJs, who have helped identify clumsy transitions and room for future improvements.AdvertisementStory continues below advertisement“To have radio DJs across the country that really care about song transitions and are listening to find everything wrong, that was awesome,” Zalon said. “It gave us hundreds of the world’s best ears. … They almost unwittingly became kind of like our QA [quality assurance] team.” (It was unclear whether any of those DJs were among the recent layoffs.)The system won’t trigger massive job cuts and could lead to new opportunities, Zalon argues, because humans will still need to create and ready the audio snippets from which the AI can select. But he expects that, in a few years, computer-generated voices could automatically read off the news, tee up interviews and introduce songs, potentially supplanting humans even more. The software performed 315 million musical transitions for listeners in January alone.The system now is used only for iHeartMedia’s digital stations, but some industry observers expect in the future that software like it could reshape local over-the-air broadcasts, too. The company’s chief product officer, Chris Williams, said last year in an interview with the industry news site RadioWorld that “virtual DJs” that could seamlessly interweave chatter, music and ads were “absolutely” coming, and “something we are always thinking about.”An artificial-intelligence first: Voice-mimicking software reportedly used in a major theftGoldberg, the iHeartMedia communications chief, said the company has invested hundreds of millions of dollars to develop high-tech systems to “substantially improve the scientific part of how we program,” processing thousands of data points related to optimized music selection and scheduling “far in excess of the capabilities of any human being to digest and use.”AdvertisementStory continues below advertisementThat has allowed the company, she said, to free up programming people for more creative pursuits, “embedding our radio stations into the communities and lives of our listeners better and deeper than they have been before.”There’s no clear indication that AI schedulers or computerized DJs would solve a long-running financial challenge of the company’s own making. In 2008, to gain control of the radio and billboard titan then known as Clear Channel, the private-equity firms Bain Capital and Thomas H. Lee Partners staged a leveraged buyout, weighing the company down with a mountain of borrowed cash they needed to seal the deal.The audacious move left the radio giant saddled with more than $20 billion in debt, just as the Great Recession kicked off and radio’s strengths began to rust. The debt would kneecap the company for the next decade, forcing it to pay more toward interest payments some years than it earned in revenue.In 2018, iHeartMedia filed for bankruptcy, saying in a statement then that it would “uphold its commitments” to its thousands of employees. “We’re here to right-size the balance sheet,” a company lawyer told a bankruptcy judge that year in Texas, where the giant had grown from a single San Antonio country music station in 1972.Dating apps need women. Advertisers need diversity. AI companies offer a solution: Fake peopleIn the year the company filed for bankruptcy, Pittman, the company’s chief and a former head of MTV and AOL, was paid roughly $13 million in salary and bonus pay, nearly three times what he made in 2016, company financial records show. In late 2018, the company also asked a bankruptcy judge for approval to boost its bonus packages for top executives even further, to more than $33 million, above the $22 million they had previously planned.The company defended the request in a court filing by saying, “Maintaining a highly motivated workforce is as important as ever.” The full bankruptcy plan was approved last year. (Executive pay packages, Goldberg said, were benchmarked against industry peers and set by the company’s board, adding, “This was not a management decision.”)The company’s push to shrink and subsume local stations was also made possible by deregulation. In 2017, the Federal Communications Commission ditched a rule requiring radio stations to maintain a studio near where they were broadcasting. Local DJs have since been further replaced by prerecorded substitutes, sometimes from hundreds of miles away.Several DJs laid off this month said they knew the business was in dismal shape. But they were stunned by how the company went about the mass “dislocation,” saying they were abruptly called in for a short meeting before being escorted off their local station’s premises, with no opportunity to say goodbye.Ashley “Z” Elzinga, a former on-air personality for 95.6 KISS FM in Cleveland, said she was upbeat about the future but frustrated that the company had said the layoffs touched only a “relatively small” slice of its workforce. “I gave my life to this,” she said. “I moved my life, moved my family.”‘MissionRacer’: How Amazon turned the tedium of warehouse work into a gameMany of the DJs said they saw local radio as a great equalizer: free, ubiquitous and open to anyone, no matter where you live or how much money you make. Since the layoffs, they’ve been inundated with messages from listeners who said they couldn’t imagine their daily lives without them. They said they don’t expect a computer-generated system will satisfy listeners or fill that void.Monisha “Mo” Mann, a former nighttime DJ for the Fresno, Calif., hip-hop station B95, announced the cut on Instagram alongside a live stream, in which her 3-year-old son could be heard in the background.“They’ve decided to replace a lot of workers, a lot of live shows, with AI … and another DJ in another state, another city, not in Fresno, don’t know nothing about Fresno,” she said, tearing up. “I just sat in my car, like, damn. This is it for me. … I just got laid off from something I loved so much.”Walton, the Columbus radio personality known as Big Kosh, said he loved the job because it let him talk about the news and hear from local listeners. For the five years of Saturdays and Sundays he worked there, between his shifts as a server at an Outback Steakhouse, he would often bring his daughter to the studio, teaching her about the business he first fell in love with as a kid recording music on cassettes.“It was something I was really looking forward to making a future out of. And in the blink of an eye, all of that stopped for me,” he said. “That’s the painful part. They just killed what I thought was the future for me.”Share234 CommentsNewsletterAs news breaksTech News AlertsBreaking news email alerts on technology and the tech industry.Sign upSubscribe to comment and get the full experience.
