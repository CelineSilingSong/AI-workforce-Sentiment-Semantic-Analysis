The threat of AI to jobs — it is a debate that won’t go away.  The Bank of England and the World Bank Chief are only two voices, in a growing network, that are concerned by the rise of AI and the loss of jobs.





This continuing question is not surprising, according to John Gikopoulos, Global Head for automation and artificial intelligence AI at Infosys Consulting: fear and uncertainty make for good headlines.

“The short answer is that no-one can accurately predict what tomorrow’s job market will look like, any more than the first observers of Stephenson’s Rocket could imagine the huge numbers of people employed by the global, multi-billion dollar railway industry of today,” explains Gikopoulos.
“We prefer to take our cue from other industrial revolutions to which we’ve somehow managed to adapt. And the most likely outcome of AI will be a positive shift in the nature of the work we do.”
“We see jobs becoming less functionary and more visionary as AI takes up the burden of repetitive processes. As we’ve described, humans will always be needed to give meaning and direction to AI. That doesn’t just mean that we’ll continue to have jobs in a world of robots – it means that our work will be more interesting and rewarding,” he says.

Getting left behind
On the flip side, one could argue, that for the millions working in the transportation industry, for example – truck drivers, taxi drivers and train drivers – the rise of AI and automation spells disaster. Will they be able to go back to university, upskill into more technical fields, ahead of students who are already studying in these technology-related areas? It is unlikely.
>Read more on AI: The possibilities and the threats posed
So, while AI can provide the opportunity to free workers up from less laborious and more innovative tasks. There is a real risk that many will be left behind.
“High-skill folks do very well in these systems, and can leverage their talents and interface with machines to extend their reach, sales, products, and services,” said then-President Obama. “Low-wage, low-skill individuals become more and more redundant, and their jobs may not be replaced, but wages will be suppressed.”
Despite the promise of new, better jobs. There is a real likelihood that AI will replace most manual tasks, and that those workers will be left behind.
Culture shift needed
The next step with AI is using the technology as an opportunity for humans to move up the value chain and get rid of these mundane jobs altogether.
“This isn’t wishful thinking: it’s an essential part of successful AI,” says Gikopoulos.
“Without ambition and creative thinking, we won’t be able to apply AI effectively to the problems that we face. That in itself is a challenge that business leaders need to solve. They need to understand how to reorient their workers’ mindsets (and, indeed, their own view of employees’ roles) to support creativity and new ways of thinking. Again – and it can’t be stressed enough – AI is only as powerful as the human understanding that puts its to work.”

Investing in artificial intelligence: What businesses need to know
To make artificial intelligence work for a business, leaders need to ensure that employee skills are honed in line with technological investments. Read here
John Gikopoulos believes that AI will create many employment opportunities, as long as business leaders are up to the challenge.
>Read more on A solution to the AI talent shortage: Recruit philosophy students
For most businesses, this will require a seismic cultural shift. “We are often fixated on core technical skills; from coding to advanced topics like data science and machine learning. But have we lost sight of the softer skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and applying insight to business strategy?”
“AI can find facts and can even recommend prescriptive or proscriptive actions – but what it can’t do is formulate a watertight strategy based on the insights it discovers. We want business leaders to foster an atmosphere of experimentation and innovation, and constantly question how they can deploy smart technologies such as AI to solve today’s challenges,” says Gikopoulos.

Using Artificial Intelligence to Search the Archive

A couple of weeks back, my colleague Caroline Alton wrote about our work on “Made by Machine: When AI Met The Archive”, our collaboration with BBC Four to produce an hour of programming, picked from the BBC’s archive entirely automatically, using machine learning techniques. Creating a TV programme with a minimum of human intervention was an ambitious project, and one without precedent at the BBC (or, to our knowledge, elsewhere), so I’m going to take some time to outline a bit more detail on the challenges we faced, and the techniques we used to bring this idea to fruition!







BBC R&D has been developing AI to help programme makers and schedulers search the BBC’s archive, which was being used to help BBC Four curate an evening of archive programming. As part of this, Cassian Harrison, controller of BBC Four, asked us to explore what would happen if artificial intelligence then tried to create a programme. This seems like a simple-enough enquiry, but we soon realised it contains interesting subtleties - beyond the practical question of whether it’s possible, there’s also the deeper question of what it might mean for an AI to ‘create’ a programme at all - what constraints would it operate under? What would inform its decisions? What would its objective in creating this programme be?
As the project took shape, some of these questions were answered as a result of the practical constraints of making the programme. We decided early on that the programme should assemble new programmes from archive footage, learning to make decisions from a corpus of the ‘best’ or most representative BBC Four programmes we’ve produced. This would require us to identify a representative set of BBC Four programmes, and to segment them into coherent ‘scenes’, for later re-assembly by the ‘AI’.
As an experiment, we tried to do this with as little human intervention as possible, in order to see what was, and wasn’t possible and let people see the results of that. Therefore, we attempted to use machine learning to derive a measure of ‘BBC Four-ness’ which we could use to select the most representative BBC Four programmes for further processing. We did this by training a linear support vector classifier to predict whether or not a given programme was broadcast on BBC Four, based on features derived from editorial metadata about that programme (genres, summaries and synopses). This performed very well, with an overall classification accuracy of 97%. We then used this model to generate a score for each programme in our archive (using the distance from the decision boundary as the score), and picked the top 150 programmes for further processing.
The candidate programmes were split into scenes using an algorithm developed by our colleague Craig Wright from BBC R&D's AI in Production project, while he was on a graduate placement with our own data team, last year. This yielded several thousand individual scenes, which could be stitched back together into new programmes by our machine learning models.
The next question, then, was how to edit these clips back together. It was apparent that there were many approaches we could have taken, based on different algorithms and feature sets, and with very different results. However, this diversity of possible approaches seemed like an interesting opportunity to us - we could use the programme to explore and compare some of these different approaches - highlighting the ways they work (and the ways they fail) in a compelling way for an audience who might not be familiar this sort of technology. In this way, we could produce a programme that wasn’t just made by machine learning, but was about machine learning too - using the task of ‘creating a programme’ to explore some of the wider questions about these technologies and how they make decisions.
Ultimately we chose to concentrate on three approaches to teaching the machine to examine and link footage from across the vast BBC archive - object detection, subtitle analysis, and ‘visual energy’ analysis, all three of which I’ll explain now.
Our first attempt at analysing the programme segments focused on the visual. We chose to apply the work of Johnson, Karpathy and Li at Stanford University in their paper DenseCap: Fully Convolutional Localization Networks for Dense Captioning to analyse the video footage of our programmes and attempt to identify the subjects depicted on screen, via automatic image captioning.

We used these captions to build sequences - starting from a random ‘seed clip’, we would then assemble a sequence by picking clips which depicted a similar scene to the previous one, as determined by our densecap model. This was the first sequence shown in the programme. This produced some interesting results - and also failed in ways which were interesting from a narrative point of view - the machine’s propensity to mis-gender short-haired women, for instance, was an obvious example of the kind of human bias which can be reproduced by machine learning systems. However, this approach really failed to capture much about the narrative subject of our scenes, and didn’t really produce a sequence with overall coherence, leading to our second approach.

The images on screen don’t tell the whole story in a TV programme - what is on the soundtrack is equally as important to the medium’s ability to tell stories. This is especially true in documentary footage (which made up a large proportion of our corpus of programmes), due to the use of voice-over to drive the overall narrative. As a result, our machine learning models really needed to be able to understand what is said as well as what is shown within our programmes, so this is where we turned our attention for the second section of the programme. Thankfully, the vast majority of our broadcast programmes have already been transcribed (in the form of subtitles), which made this part of the process significantly easier. Using the programme subtitles, we applied various natural language processing techniques including TF-IDF and Word2Vec in order to build a model of semantic similarity between scenes based on their subtitles, and used this to build the second sequence in the programme.
This produced a number of interesting sequences, which to our eyes, appeared to have more thematic coherence than the object-detection approach. The sequence which was selected for the final programme, in particular, to me at least, has rather an interesting thread about British social history running through it - ranging from the Harold Wilson government’s building of the National Theatre, to the philosophical reflections of a Routemaster bus conductor. However, while this produced a promising sequence - we felt that our approaches so far had neglected to incorporate the aesthetic craft of TV storytelling - the way in which moving images and sound are combined to give the impression of specific feelings or sensations, as well as to show images and tell stories. As a result, for our third sequence, we attempted to build a sequence with particular affective properties, rather than a particular coherent story.

In order to do this, after some discussion with Cassian and the BBC Four team, we decided to attempt to model the amount of ‘energy’ or ‘dynamism’ in a given scene - the combination of pace of editing, and movement of camera and/or subject which can make a given scene feel relaxing or tense, melancholy or uplifting. We built a model which uses the results of the MPEG-2 video encoding process to rank scenes by their perceived dynamism, then used these ‘visual energy scores’ to map scenes to a ‘narrative curve’ - starting with low energy clips, building to a ‘peak’ of more energetic scenes, before tapering off again. This did indeed produce an interesting analysis of filmic style, and the differences between the high-and-low energy clips seemed pretty apparent (with a couple of exceptions - very grainy, archive film footage, for instance, would consistently be perceived by the machine as ‘high energy’). On it’s own though, this approach doesn’t make for particularly interesting viewing, due to the total absence of any narrative structure to the programme it produces. The question then, is whether we could combine our three approaches into a fourth approach which was greater than the sum of its parts?

This is exactly what we attempted with the fourth and final sequence in the programme. Using Long short-term memory deep neural networks, and all the feature representations learned by our previous models, we attempted to learn a sequence model from our corpus of BBC Four programmes - allowing the machine to use all the features we’d derived earlier to learn a sequencing of scenes from the actions of the (human) editors of our archive programmes. At this point the workings of the machine were both un-controllable by its human operators, but also un-interpretable - in complicated neural networks, it’s very difficult to inspect or interpret why certain decisions are made - we could simply sit back and watch, and attempt to interpret the machine’s work, in the same way as the audience of the programme.
So, did this work? in terms of producing compelling television, we’ll let you be the judge of that - at the time of writing, the programme is available to watch on BBC iPlayer. More generally though, the project was a resounding success in research terms - the techniques and technologies we use have wider application in developing products, services and tools that enable easier access to archive programmes, and the reuse of our archive in new and creative ways, a direction which we are going to continue to explore in the coming months. In addition, having the opportunity to make a TV programme has taught us loads about the TV production process, and given us plenty of ideas for future projects!

Dr. Lee is the author of AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order
Sinovation Ventures





Dr. Kai-Fu Lee, a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence, has two daughters. One is a fashion designer. The other is a photographer. Instead of following their father into computer science, they followed their heart, passion and skills. Lee encouraged them to do what they love because his work in making a machine more like a human has given him a unique glimpse into what separates humans from machines.

In his new book, AI Superpowers, Dr. Lee examines the race between China and Silicon Valley for the lead in artificial intelligence. I’ll leave it other columnists to dig deeper into the battle of two global superpowers. I chose to spend my conversation with Lee on the other half of his book where he explains how we can all thrive in the age of artificial intelligence.
First, the bad news. Artificial intelligence will take over human jobs. A lot of them. According to Lee, in the next fifteen years, artificial intelligence will be able to “technically” replace 40 to 50% of all jobs in the United States. Lee makes an important caveat: just because AI can replace half of all jobs, doesn’t mean it will. However, “the disruption to job markets will be very real, very large, and coming soon,” Lee writes.
PROMOTED
Now, the good news. And there’s plenty of it. First, there will be no robot apocalypse. Lee says we should keep that notion where it belongs—in science fiction movies. Despite all the advances in machine learning, Lee says we are “nowhere near” creating machines that have any emotion—at all. And that’s why AI has its limits.

A computer isn’t proud and jubilant when it beats a human chess or Go champion. It has no capacity to feel love, excitement, compassion, or to dream of doing something other than what it was programmed to do. It has no imagination. It cannot motivate, inspire, or instill a desire to serve others. “It in in this uniquely human potential for growth, compassion, and love where I see hope,” says Lee.

The cancer scare that changed Lee's outlook. In our conversation, Lee told me about a personal health crisis that changed the way he thought about how AI and humans will co-exist. In 2013, Lee was diagnosed with stage IV lymphoma. After treatment, Lee’s cancer went into remission.
As one of the top AI researchers in the world and a venture-capital investor, Lee was a workaholic, leaving little time for family or friends. He was obsessed with building more and more powerful AI algorithms. After his cancer scare, he completely reshuffled his priorities, spending less time on social media, more time with his family, and pursuing the projects he deeply cared about. He spends more time mentoring young Chinese professionals, in addition to running one of China’s most prestigious venture capital firms, Sinovation Ventures. His cancer diagnosis also gave him a fresh perspective on the technology he had pioneered.
 Dr. Lee realized that AI will not undercut our value as long as we double-down on what makes us truly human.  “AI can handle a growing number of non-personal, non-creative, routine tasks,” Lee told me. But Lee says the skills that make us uniquely human are ones that no machine can replicate. The jobs of the future, says Lee, will require creative, compassionate, and empathetic leaders who know how to create trust, build teams, inspire service, and communicate effectively.
“People don't want to interact with robots for communication-oriented jobs,” says Lee. “They don't want to listen to robots making speeches, leading the company, giving pep talks, our earning our trust. They don’t want robots to be teachers and nurses. We will end up with the inevitable outcome that, although large numbers of routine jobs will be eliminated, large numbers of empathetic jobs will be created.”
AI creates role for compassionate caregivers. It’s in the field of medicine where Lee sees a great opportunity for AI and humans to co-exist. “I have little doubt that AI algorithms will eventually far surpass human doctors in their ability to diagnose disease and recommend treatments,” Lee writes in his book. “One response to this would be to get rid of doctors entirely…but patients don’t want to be treated by a machine, a black box of medical knowledge that delivers a cold pronouncement.”
According to Lee, the medical personnel of the future will be “compassionate caregivers.” They will be trained in using the latest diagnostic tools, and also in communication, counseling, and emotional support. Instead of dryly informing patients of their chances of survival, they’ll share encouraging stories, explain, guide and comfort patients through the treatment process.
Educating students to co-exist with AI. Lee told me that the future of AI completely disrupts how the U.S. and China teaches its students. By focusing on rote memorization, students have no chance to best a machine. Instead, says Lee, education should focus on helping students discover and nurture their creative talents. “If you’re destined to be the next Einstein, we should encourage your interest in math and science. If you're destined to a poet, painter or great philosopher, it should be encouraged, too.”
Lee says communication, teamwork, empathy and creativity must be taught as early as possible. “Those are the skills that matter in the future. No leader can be a great leader without those skills.” And that’s why Lee encouraged his daughters to pursue their passions. “They both received a good basic education [including math, science and physics], but I also made it a priority for them to become eloquent, trustworthy, and decent people who love what they do and who others like to work with.”
After thirty years of pioneering work in artificial intelligence at Google China, Microsoft, Apple and other companies, Lee says he’s figured out the blueprint for humans to thrive in the coming decade of massive technological disruption: “Let us choose to let machines be machines, and let humans be humans.”Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here. Carmine GalloFollowingFollowMy new book, The Bezos Blueprint, reveals leadership and communication strategies that fueled Amazon's growth.

From Sourcing to Hire: Artificial Intelligence in Recruiting

Updated: Oct 2, 2018




Every other day, there is an article about artificial intelligence (AI) and recruiting that’s taking the Internet by storm, but what’s the excitement about? Is bringing AI into the recruitment industry the next big thing?
 Machine learning is about predicting the future based on the past. Through years of research and data collection, AI has emerged from the ashes of big data and predictive analysis.

A recruiter serves as the middle person between the hiring manager and the candidate. AI helps to ease the hiring pipeline and allow a company to get more done, allowing you to spend time on more important activities, like building relationships with a high-profile candidate and adding value to recruiting on a strategic level.
AI is transforming hiring by assisting HR professionals in various recruitment processes, from identifying talent to mapping behavioral assessments of candidates. In a survey conducted in 2018, 36% of candidates feel the traditional interviewing methods are too time-consuming.
Hiring using AI not only saves money and time but also leverages them so you can select people who best suit your business. AI can predict the future needs of the candidates. Then, the recruiter can influence them with attractive plans and offers.
Let me start by explaining the hiring pipeline and the impact of AI in each step.
1. Job Publishing
A standard way to approach candidates is through staffing and recruiting agencies to help them reach their dream job. The quality of your applicants depends on the initial candidates you attract with your job posting. Because this is the first phase of recruiting, AI helps you to formulate clear, detailed job descriptions that explain what exactly you are looking for in candidates.
AI will analyze the data about a company, like its corporate culture, hiring trends, and current employees, in order to determine which company can best match this particular candidate and why.
The right message to the right person at the right time is what matters. So, the job should be posted in the right place for the best exposure. AI suggests the right sources for a particular job based on complex algorithms analyzing the hit ratios and market trends to get your job exactly where the right candidates are, thereby maximizing your reach.
2. Talent Acquisition
Fifty-two percent of talent acquisition leaders say the hardest part of recruitment is screening candidates from a large applicant pool. When your job description accurately represents who you’re looking to hire, AI can identify the right hire who fits your needs.
Recruiters don’t actually recruit people. Their primary job is processing applicants. Even though AI strikes fear in automating the recruiting process, its algorithms have proven beneficial for the legal and medical fields—according to 72.8% of recruiters, who say they are struggling to find relevant candidates. AI can bridge this gap between recruiters/staffing agencies and candidates.

	



3. Candidate Screening
According to a survey by CareerBuilder, in 2006, just 5% of the recruiters were using social media screening. By 2016, it was up to 60%, and in 2017, it was 70%. This reveals the impact of social media. A recruiter spends almost 3.5 hours per day on résumé reviews and candidate screening. This time can be put to better use.
AI acts as a personal assistant to recruiters by automating many of the mundane tasks that eat up the day. One of the best ways to utilize AI is through chatbots and automated message services.
By assigning rules and triggers through chatbots and automated message services, you can automate conversations related to specific hiring or job queries and receive instant answers.
AI uses machine learning, meaning that the more data it has at its disposal, the better it becomes at predicting successful outcomes. Thus, less time will be spent on sourcing and screening, and there will be more time for building candidate relationships, developing culture, and conducting other value-added HR activities.
4. Machines as Matchmakers
In order to make the right hire, every recruiter needs his or her recruitment process to function as a well-oiled machine. With greater access to relevant data than ever before, recruiters are in a better position to match jobseekers with better job openings. AI improves the odds of creating a great match from the beginning of the recruiting process by applying predictive algorithms to make predictions that select only the most relevant jobs before showing them to jobseekers.
To get the recruitment process right, AI algorithms are incorporated in the company’s recruitment tool. Recruiting processes, like finding candidates, résumé parsing, sending follow-up e-mails, arranging interviews, evaluating assessments, and getting feedback, are all automated.
5. Hire and Keep
Keeping track of your internal employees is just as important as getting new ones in the organization. AI remains relevant even after the actual hiring process. Pay attention to details like why employees leave companies or switch departments.
The employee experience is a great factor influencing potential candidates. According to recruiters, 48% say that better company culture attracts better prospective hires. Algorithms can be the biggest help in keeping your employees happy.
In part two of this article, I’ll explain why recruiters should embrace AI.

Management consultant, educator and author Peter Drucker once declared that increasing the productivity of knowledge workers was ""the most important contribution management needs to make in the 21st century.""Related: AI Is Taking the Art Out of SalesAI is changing that. More than 75 percent of companies are firing up AI to accelerate business development, automate busy work and deliver a better customer experience.



AI algorithms are powering massive amounts of calculations and decisions because they can find patterns in data, unseen to the naked eye. They're evolving technology in powerful ways that are enhancing our knowledge work:1. Automating the work humans don't want to doThe most liberating support comes from AI doing the jobs we find monotonous. AI platforms can do repetitive tasks, like learn how to automatically update contact data in your customer relationship manager (CRM) or generate weekly status reports for your leads.


In the business development world, AI and machine learning tools sort through leads and pull a wide range of data together about your prospect list. The tedious work of organizing contact information or researching prospect demographics can be handed to bots and allow your sales team to focus on selling.Related: 11 Ways to Boost Your Sales Performance2. Automating the work we can't doHow many hours per week do you need to focus on selling to meet your quotas and keep the business growing?You probably don't have hundreds of hours left over for data science. But, that's what it takes to review large data sets to find trends in your industry, uncover business opportunities and stay ahead of the competition. Whether you want to know which companies are actively searching for your solution or how qualified they are, the data is available -- but it's complex and spread out across multiple websites and databases.


AI bots and services can look at how many pieces of content are being shared around a topic, determine traffic volume, number of companies searching for your product/service and their lead score.AI can also deliver complex data sets to be reviewed on one platform, instead of having your team sort through thousands of lists or records. It can review and mark this data, then provide a report of actionable insights.3. Improving lead quality and shortening sales cyclesA full pipeline isn't useful if the leads aren't relevant or qualified. Today, many companies use a variety of people and tools to do basic data entry before these leads are delivered to a salesperson. Even then, they're only guessing which leads will be interested.Sales teams that use predictive analytics spend less time prospecting and more time selling, which motivates them and makes them more successful in their role. This reduces sales department churn.


AI is the new go-to partner for this relationship. Algorithms can now score leads based on key performance indicators (KPIs) and historical success patterns. The closer a new lead matches your existing best-value customers, the higher AI can score it.Delivering a flow of the best leads who are ready to buy can significantly reduce your sales cycle times. It gives you more revenue opportunities because your team isn't overwhelmed with prospecting or follow up -- they're focused on selling to qualified opportunities.Focusing on the people already looking for your solution provides a more enjoyable process for both you and your future customer.Related: 7 Key Selling Habits All Sales Professionals Must Develop


4. Predicting cross-sell and up-sell opportunitiesAI provides a connection that we weren't expecting initially but are pleased to see: people who want the advanced services our sales team can offer.Up-sells and cross-sells are often missed because sales teams lack a definitive process for whom to up-sell and when. It's the easiest and most neglected part of the sales process.AI makes your sales process more predictable by finding the customer personas who are most likely to say yes. That ensures sales teams are focused on customers with the largest revenue opportunity and the highest likelihood of converting.Advanced analytics can help create these personas, and the AI underneath it can continuously update those personas based on how successful its past model was. Buyers enjoy the help. Businesses enjoy the increase in revenue. And sales teams enjoy hitting those stretch goals and maximizing their bonuses.


5. Forecasting sales projections for specific customer personas and offersInternational Data Corporation (IDC) notes that real-time personalization of ads will arrive by 2020. The goal for these platforms is improving the accuracy of targeting, increasing the precision of its messaging and ensuring the context is appropriate for the customer and their pain points.Smart AI will power these platforms and we can start to see it bridging the gap between inbound marketing and outbound sales development -- aligning sales and marketing once and for all.When we look at the possibility: It's targeting your best customer personas with the best messaging to analyze buying stages, marketing channels and optimize them all. In essence, we're learning the personas that respond best to each offer and when up-sells correlate with an increase in churn.It's possible for AI to scan an entire integrated database, from CRM and customer orders to conversation intelligence and lead scoring tools. Machine learning can build out customer personas that include risk prediction and sales potentials, segmenting groups into a variety of characteristics.


It's a nuanced understanding of the customer journey that takes a few extra things into account:Customer lifetime valueRisks relative to sales thresholdsIntervention points for sales and supportProjections by category and product type within customer groups as well as individual customersThis greater understanding can be used to guide a variety of business decisions. Initially, companies can use it to manage pricing and sales strategies. Later, there's a clear understanding of messaging success rates by persona and product needs -- even the potential for a tailored customer journey with offers designed to maximize revenue, while minimizing churn.Related: 7 Tips for Getting More Sales Meetings With Prospects6. Making human work more meaningful and valuableAI in business development boils down to this: It gives us the freedom to focus on our unique abilities. We're not bogged down with repetitive busy work or boring data entry. We can focus on the meaningful work -- the elements that lead to a successful sale and customer experience.


AI runs in the background and gives us the ability to increase the productivity of knowledge work.""Every few hundred years throughout Western history, a sharp transformation has occurred,"" Drucker observed in a 1992 essay for Harvard Business Review.In a matter of decades, technology altogether has evolved at light speed -- its purpose, applications and capabilities. Years later, AI is changing our work in meaningful ways. And the people entering this brave new world can't imagine work without this valuable tool. AI is transforming technology, saving us time and uncovering new sales opportunities -- and surely exceeding the expectations of Peter Drucker.

Dumb artificial intelligence has become a comic foil in the age of algorithms, and it’s not good news for understanding what AI actually can do.",N/A,All we know is that we don’t know nothing,N/A,http://schema.org/,,N/A,N/A,"Tech/Artificial IntelligenceBurger King’s ‘AI-written’ ads show we’re still very confused about artificial intelligenceBurger King’s ‘AI-written’ ads show we’re still very confused about artificial intelligence / All we know is that we don’t know nothingBy  James Vincent, a senior reporter who has covered AI, robotics, and more for eight years at The Verge. Oct 3, 2018, 1:18 PM EDTShare this story0 Comments / 0 NewEach of Burger King’s new ads starts with an anachronistic burst of noise from a dial-up modem and a solemn warning: “This ad was created by artificial intelligence.” Then, over shots of glistening burgers and balletic fries, a robotic-sounding narrator deploys exactly the sort of clunky grammar and conceptual malapropisms we expect from a dumb AI. “The chicken crossed the road to become a sandwich. Burger King encouraged the chicken,” says the voice. “The Whopper lives in a bun mansion, just like you,” it chirps.They’re good ads! And, of course, they’re lies. In a press release, Burger King claims the videos are the work of a “new deep learning algorithm,” but an article from AdAge makes it clear that humans — not machines —  are responsible for the funnies. “Artificial intelligence is not a substitute for a great creative idea coming from a real person,” Burger King’s global head of brand marketing, Marcelo Pascoa, told the publication. It’s a silly, unimportant deception, but one that points to an important truth: we really don’t know what artificial intelligence is and is not capable of. Burger King’s joke lands because AI exists in the public imagination as a quantum entity — simultaneously powerful and pathetic. Artificial intelligence is about to take our jobs, we’re constantly told; it’s going to destroy the economy and humanity to boot. But we also know from our own experience that it’s incredibly dumb, incapable of understanding the simplest commands (hello, Siri), or telling the difference between a stop sign and a cyclist, or of not showing me nine toilet seats I might like to buy after I buy the one toilet seat I will need this decade. This fallibility makes AI a perfect comic foil in the age of algorithms. It can stand in for the stupidity of the machines that run our lives, and help us process this brave new world. Some people exploit this potential using genuine machine learning (e.g., Janelle Shane and her AI-generated beer names, Harry Potter characters, and so on), while others, like Burger King, only pretend to (see also: those viral memes that start “I forced a bot to watch ____”).On the one hand, this understanding of AI as an idiot savant is perfectly sensible. Artificial intelligence is dumb, anyone in the industry will tell you that. But it also creates a cloud of confusion that mainly benefits the people who control and profit from this technology. In a recent essay, filmmaker and writer Astra Taylor described the concept of “fauxtomation,” where companies oversell the technological capabilities of their products. Sometimes this is harmless, she says, like “smart” ovens that just scan barcodes to find out how long to cook your dinner. In other instances it’s more insidious and even dangerous, like when people pretend to be chatbots, or when the “AI moderators” removing gruesome and disturbing videos turn out to be human. if we don’t understand AI, we won’t know how to fix the problems it createsAs Taylor argues, automation — including automation powered by AI — isn’t neutral. It’s used to justify stagnant pay and worsening work conditions. It’s used to threaten people who might organize for better jobs (“$15 an hour? We’ll find a robot who’ll work for less”), and with fauxtomation, it often erases the lives of people at the bottom of the economic food chain. This means that having a good understanding of what technology can and cannot do is vital. It helps the public and politicians know what’s at stake, and what needs to be done to avoid the worst outcomes. Of course, Burger King’s ads are just that: ads. But they’re also the latest product of our anxiety about AI. We used to worry that machines would get jobs flipping burgers. Now we know that’s happening, and we worry they’re going to write our ads instead. Comments0 Comments / 0 NewFeatured Videos From The VergeApple and OpenAI make a deal | The Vergecast

“The chicken crossed the road to become a sandwich. Burger King encouraged the chicken,” says the voice. “The Whopper lives in a bun mansion, just like you,” it chirps.

They’re good ads! And, of course, they’re lies. In a press release, Burger King claims the videos are the work of a “new deep learning algorithm,” but an article from AdAge makes it clear that humans — not machines —  are responsible for the funnies. “Artificial intelligence is not a substitute for a great creative idea coming from a real person,” Burger King’s global head of brand marketing, Marcelo Pascoa, told the publication. 

[Media: https://youtu.be/cS8H9-9hzzE]

It’s a silly, unimportant deception, but one that points to an important truth: we really don’t know what artificial intelligence is and is not capable of. 

Burger King’s joke lands because AI exists in the public imagination as a quantum entity — simultaneously powerful and pathetic. Artificial intelligence is about to take our jobs, we’re constantly told; it’s going to destroy the economy and humanity to boot. But we also know from our own experience that it’s incredibly dumb, incapable of understanding the simplest commands (hello, Siri), or telling the difference between a stop sign and a cyclist, or of not showing me nine toilet seats I might like to buy after I buy the one toilet seat I will need this decade. 

This fallibility makes AI a perfect comic foil in the age of algorithms. It can stand in for the stupidity of the machines that run our lives, and help us process this brave new world. Some people exploit this potential using genuine machine learning (e.g., Janelle Shane and her AI-generated beer names, Harry Potter characters, and so on), while others, like Burger King, only pretend to (see also: those viral memes that start “I forced a bot to watch ____”).

On the one hand, this understanding of AI as an idiot savant is perfectly sensible. Artificial intelligence is dumb, anyone in the industry will tell you that. But it also creates a cloud of confusion that mainly benefits the people who control and profit from this technology. 

In a recent essay, filmmaker and writer Astra Taylor described the concept of “fauxtomation,” where companies oversell the technological capabilities of their products. Sometimes this is harmless, she says, like “smart” ovens that just scan barcodes to find out how long to cook your dinner. In other instances it’s more insidious and even dangerous, like when people pretend to be chatbots, or when the “AI moderators” removing gruesome and disturbing videos turn out to be human. 

""if we don’t understand AI, we won’t know how to fix the problems it creates""

As Taylor argues, automation — including automation powered by AI — isn’t neutral. It’s used to justify stagnant pay and worsening work conditions. It’s used to threaten people who might organize for better jobs (“$15 an hour? We’ll find a robot who’ll work for less”), and with fauxtomation, it often erases the lives of people at the bottom of the economic food chain. This means that having a good understanding of what technology can and cannot do is vital. It helps the public and politicians know what’s at stake, and what needs to be done to avoid the worst outcomes. 

Of course, Burger King’s ads are just that: ads. But they’re also the latest product of our anxiety about AI. We used to worry that machines would get jobs flipping burgers. Now we know that’s happening, and we worry they’re going to write our ads instead.

Technologies in the field of data science are progressing at an exponential rate. The introduction of Machine Learning has revolutionized the world of data science by enabling computers to classify and comprehend large data sets. Another important innovation which has changed the paradigm of the world of the technology is Artificial Intelligence (AI). The two technological concepts, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, are often used as interchangeable terms. However, it is important to understand that these technologies supplement each other and are different in terms of their core functions.    Technology enthusiasts and social scientists often predict that human beings in the workforce will soon be replaced by self-learning robots. It is yet to be seen whether there is any truth to these predictions, but for 2017, the following trends have been prominent in the development of Machine Learning. Giant companies will develop Machine Learning-based Artificial Intelligence systems In 2016, we saw many noteworthy developments in the domain of Machine Learning, and numerous artificial intelligence applications found a way to our phone screens and caught our attention. In the previous year, companies merely touched the tip of the iceberg and in 2017, big names such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, and IBM are already fighting a development war. Google and Amazon launched successful apps, which include Amazon Echo and Google Home, at the beginning of the year, and we have yet to see what else these tech giants have in stores for their customers. Algorithm Economy will be on the rise  Businesses greatly value data and utilize it to take the appropriate actions, whether it’s to understand the consumer demand or comprehend a company’s financial standing. However, it is not the data alone they should value, because, without an appropriate algorithm, that data is worth nothing. Peter Sondergaard, Senior Vice President of Gartner Research, says, “Data is inherently dumb and the real value lies in the algorithms which deduce meaningful results from a cluster of meaningless data.""  The Algorithm Economy has taken center stage for the past couple of years, and the trend is expected to follow as we anticipate further developments in machine learning tools. The use of the algorithm economy will distinguish small players from the market dominators in 2017. Small businesses that have just entered the transitional phase of embedding machine learning processes into their business models will be using canned algorithms in tools such as BI, CRM, and predictive analysis. On the contrary, large enterprises will use proprietary ML algorithms. Expect more interaction between machines and humans  Google Home and Amazon Echo received an exceedingly positive response from their respective audiences, which made it evident that consumers perceive human-machine interaction positively. Innovative technologies embedded with machine learning processes prove to be helpful under various circumstances (for example, helping people with vision impairments to navigate). But will they completely replace human-human interaction? Maybe 25 years down the road, but we don’t see that happening anytime soon. Machine learning has made it increasingly possible for machines to learn new skills, such as to sort, analyze and comprehend. But nevertheless, there are certain limitations to it. Automated cars have frequently been tested, and even with modified algorithms and advanced technologies, the chance of an error is still present. Conclusion Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are promising fields with much potential for growth. We have seen some recent developments in the sector which, not long ago, people believed were not possible. Therefore, we cannot give a definite verdict regarding the industry’s potential for growth. For now, intelligent machines are only capable of handling repetitive tasks and can follow predetermined patterns. They lack the skill to figure things out which are unordinary, and we still require human intervention for keeping the chaos at bay in such situations.

 Malcolm and Carolyn Wiener Annual Lecture and  The Malcolm and Carolyn Wiener Annual Lecture on Science and Technology 

Kai-Fu Lee discusses the advances in artificial intelligence technology, the effects on the future of work, and the technology race between the United States and China.
PAREKH: Welcome, everybody, to today’s Council on Foreign Relations Malcolm and Carolyn Wiener Lecture on Science and Technology on “The Artificial Intelligence Race and the New World Order” with Dr. Kai-Fu Lee. Dr. Kai-Fu Lee is chairman and chief executive officer of Sinovation Ventures and president of Sinovation Ventures’ Artificial Intelligence Institute, and author of the new book—new bestselling book, I would add—AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order.
A special thanks to Malcolm and Carolyn Wiener for making the lectureship possible, and we’re happy to have Malcolm in the audience today.
I am Deven Parekh, managing director at Insight Venture Partners, and I will be presiding over today’s discussion.
Thank you, Dr. Lee, and I really enjoyed the book, as a fellow venture capitalist.
LEE: Thank you, Deven. Thanks.
PAREKH: I thought we would set the context with maybe you just starting with a little bit of your background and how you got here.
LEE: Sure. I’ve started working on artificial intelligence, or AI, thirty-eight years ago in my sophomore year in this city, at Columbia. And I’ve been an AI researcher. I’ve developed AI products at Apple, Microsoft, Google. And Sinovation Ventures makes most of our investments in AI. So I’ve seen AI from all around, and that’s pretty much my experience. We’re a venture capital firm, basically investing exclusively in China. AI is one of our—is our biggest area of investment.
PAREKH: So you were educated in the U.S., but you ended up working for, first, Microsoft in China, and then Google in China.
LEE: Right. Yes.
PAREKH: What was it like running the China sub of a U.S. company?
LEE: Well, at Microsoft Research—I started at Microsoft Research, so that was a lot of fun. Bill let us do whatever we wanted, just hired smart people and do research and ignore all the other things. So that was different.
Google China was probably both the most exhalating and also the most frustrating job that I’ve had. The exhilarating part was it was a time of ascension for Google. That brand everywhere in the world attracted the smartest people. People were saying if you don’t get—if you didn’t get invited for an interview with Google, it means your IQ is not high enough. It was so much so that in China, Silicon Valley, I got I think the smartest team I’ve ever had, and that was the great part. And we did a lot of things. We actually, despite—people seem to just remember the exit, but during my tenure we took Google’s share from nine percent to twenty-four percent, possibly as high as it’s conceivably able to go. And then—and then Google pulled out.
The frustrating part is, I think, between the values that the Chinese government wanted to ensure, and the laws and regulations, and Google’s own values, in particular the three words don’t do evil, which is a terrible—I mean, Google is a brilliant company. I love the company, but those are three terrible words to have for a corporate value because it allows everyone to interpret it however they want. And it ended up being basically a clash of values, a lot of trust lost, and Google decided to pull out. Now, I, of course, have no idea about the final incidents, but I kind of saw the downward spiral, so I left in September ’09 and Google pulled out in December ’09.
PAREKH: It was a common experience for many other companies outside of Google to not really be able to successfully penetrate China, whether it be Amazon, Yahoo, many others—Yahoo, only through their investment in Alibaba, ended up being the driver of value. Any common characteristics that you saw as to why these U.S. companies had trouble succeeding in China?
LEE: OK, so first I want to talk about the past—about, you know, ten years ago—and then I want to talk about now.
PAREKH: Right.
LEE: Back ten years ago, I think the issue is there was just too much presumption that U.S., in particular Silicon Valley, was the center of the world, and easily Silicon Valley companies took over Europe and Japan and wherever it went—South America. Basically, viewed China just another market. But China was just too different, not just in the regulations, but in the users, language, culture, patterns, expectations.
And also, the other very big issue was that multinationals generally send salespeople to run these organizations. And the salespeople have a quota. They have a KPI. They’re very smart about lowballing expectations and beating it, and then getting their promotion to be the corporate senior VP at headquarters.
PAREKH: Back in Silicon Valley. Often back in Silicon Valley, right.
LEE: Exactly. Their goal was to do the China thing for two years and then get promoted to senior VP and back to the U.S., so they would just lowball the numbers and beat it. But they were against these gladiators in China who own, you know, sixty percent of the company, who don’t want to just win, they want everyone else to lose—(laughter)—and they fight for winner take all and no holds barred. So they were just no match for the local. So that was ten years ago.
PAREKH: Yeah, and my—our experience at the time is anytime we would call into China, it would be this is the Amazon of China JD, and Alibaba, and Baidu is the Google.
LEE: Yeah.
PAREKH: And every time we thought about investment, we just said, OK, is it a U.S. version that succeeded? Then maybe we should look at it. Today, obviously, that’s changed.
LEE: Yes. Very different, yeah.
PAREKH: So talk a little bit about how that market evolved, no longer a copycat market.
LEE: Right. Yeah. So, basically, the conclusion I would reach is that today is a very different story. Now, even if American companies woke up and said, uh-oh, I’m going to find someone just as gladiatorial as my Chinese competitor, there would probably be no chance. And why is that? Because China has evolved in the last ten years from copycat to a(n) inspired by America, but build a better product—usually—to Chinese innovation.
I think Silicon Valley thinks that it’s—a company is only valid if it has an original brilliant idea and builds the product and shocks the world, and obviously we are all huge fans when that happens. But that is not the only way to build a product. China started as a copycat because China had a 0.2 percent internet penetration back in ’96. So it had nowhere to go but to learn from the U.S. But it is not true that once a copycat, always a copycat. The Chinese original copycats learned what they had to learn. And there are some who remain copycats for life and they are nowhere—they made some money, but they really got nowhere—but there are some people who learn how to build a product, who learn how to satisfy users, who learn how to beat competitors, who learn new business models that were not Silicon Valley-originated. And then they went on to become serial entrepreneurs who invented, I would say, a completely different way of entrepreneurship in China, and now they’re innovating using that model.
So today, you know, companies like Ant Financial, (Total ?), TikTok, Crysho (ph), VIPKID, Mobike, these are companies—and Pinduoduo—you probably never heard of them unless they happen to have gone public recently here, and you probably don’t understand them. The one phrase that describes them are probably not accurate. And I wouldn’t be able to explain any of them to you in less than five minutes because these are Chinese innovation powered by Chinese method of entrepreneurism, and these companies are worth anywhere between two billion and a hundred billion. So I think the wave of Chinese innovation is coming. This is with or without AI, which is another topic.
PAREKH: We’re going to come to that.
LEE: Yeah. With or without AI.
And I think it—America needs to study this method of entrepreneurism. It isn’t better or worse; it’s different. To Silicon Valley it would look ugly, but it works. It creates value. And I think Harvard Business School, you know, will use these for case studies. I think business schools are the ones who will be open-minded to studying these. I think Silicon Valley will look down upon this and frown upon them as once a copycat, always a copycat. So I’m glad to be in New York talking to people who might listen, because for America—think about this—a Chinese young entrepreneur is learning from U.S. and China simultaneously. A U.S. entrepreneur, if he or she only learns from Silicon Valley, you’re missing half the lessons. How are you going to compete in a world where you take half as many lessons?
PAREKH: Well, let’s talk about AI, which is obviously the big topic of your book. Your Ph.D. thesis, I think it was at Carnegie Mellon, was over thirty years ago. And yet, it was probably twenty or twenty-five years later before anything really happened in AI.
LEE: Yes, yes.
PAREKH: Talk about why.
LEE: Two main reasons.
One is a big breakthrough ten years ago called deep learning. Stated simply, deep learning is a way for one single domain to use a huge amount of data to train a system to do things much better than people can do. But keep in mind this is single domain, like playing Go, recognizing faces, serving ads, but not broad intelligence. One single domain with objective quantitative methods. And that breakthrough was a breakthrough that none of us AI researchers really expected. We always thought we’d find ways to understand the human brain. No progress on that, but this pattern recognition became amazingly good—so good that it can take off in many, many areas.
But it has some big constraints. One constraint is a single domain. I mentioned that. The other is huge amount of data. So it only works when you have huge amounts of data. So while some of the similar ideas had been proposed at the time when I did my Ph.D., there just wasn’t enough data to make it work. So the internet created enough data and enough object tagging. Every time you use Amazon, Google, you click, that’s teaching it something about you, and that was gathered to make internet companies the first wave of great AI companies. So deep learning and huge amounts of data.
PAREKH: You talk in your book about the four phases of AI.
LEE: Yeah.
PAREKH: If you could just walk through them at a high level, and kind of where are we on the evolution of each of them?
LEE: OK. Internet AI is pretty mature. All internet companies that have lots of users, lots of data, they use it. They use it to target ads, to get you to get better results monetize off of you.
And, by the way, the AI is also trained with an object function. Why that is is when you get all the data, you basically say, go make the default rate low for the loans, or go target ads so we get maximum ad revenue, or go show the newsfeed so that people stay the longest minutes on Facebook, OK? So the wonderful thing is you get this wonderful knob on this tool that maximizes what you want, and the more data you feed it the better it gets.
So back to the wave. Second wave is business AI, so a bank, insurance, hospital, government branches. Take a bank as an example. You can use all the transactional data of all of your customers to decide credit card fraud, loan default and approval, asset allocation, and of course target each customer with the right kind of investment products that he or she may buy. So that’s the business wave. So all the companies that have lots of data previously thought of them as just a cost center; now they can be monetized.
The third wave is when AI can see and hear. So speech and vision, cameras in airports that protect us, that do face recognition of terrorists; Amazon Echo, that we talk to; Amazon Go as the ultimate autonomous store. And extrapolate from that autonomous systems: hospitals that can watch patients so they don’t call, that can report when patients do fall or have an issue; autonomous fast food with cooks and chefs and cashiers all done automatically, but not robots that walk around. All you need are cameras and sensors, and then users—I mean, customers will go in and take this and put it in the pocket, you can directly charge them for it because that action was recognized and understood. So that’s third wave, with eyes and ears.
Fourth wave would be autonomous AI with arms and legs. Not necessarily with arms that look like this, but basically the ability to move and manipulate. So that could be autonomous factory floor assembly line, so no more humans; autonomous dishwasher; autonomous fruit picker. And I’m not making these up. We invested in companies that did each one of these. If you want that dishwasher, it’s $300,000, so—(laughter)—I’ll take a check if you want that. But for restaurants it makes sense because if you have five dishwashers, in a year and a half you’ve paid back, right? And then going on to—eventually to consumer robotics
But, of course, the big autonomous app is autonomous vehicles. That will completely disrupt our transportation and logistics, probably dramatically increasing our GDP; our savings, because we won’t have to buy cars anymore; improving our efficiency, because not much congestion; improve the pollution, because they’ll be electronic vehicles; and also displace a lot of jobs; and, oh, also increase—improve the safety because, again, AI gets better with data. So the first day that the car launches, maybe it’s one percent safer than humans. But give it five years, it’s probably eighty percent better than humans. Give it ten years, it’s probably ninety percent better than humans. And then give it fifteen years, humans probably won’t be allowed to drive because—(laughter)—we’ll be the greatest hazard to ourselves.
PAREKH: There are those who have a very dystopian view of AI as you get from phase four to phase five and phase six that we haven’t even imagined yet. I think Elon Musk even called it more dangerous than nuclear weapons.
LEE: Yes.
PAREKH: What’s your perspective on it?
LEE: Well, I think a lot of the dystopians actually are not AI experts. AI experts generally see this as a super patter recognizer.
What’s misleading is if you just read the newspaper you will see one breakthrough after another, right? First, chess and then Go; and then diagnosing lung cancer, skin cancer; and then you see these autonomous vehicles and you see AI that’s, you know, figuring out energy problems. So every day you open the paper you see more breakthroughs. So this gives certain people who write books to exaggerate the story to say that when these applications grow exponentially we’ll be facing what’s called singularity, and then suddenly one day we wake up, they control us or they’re smarter than us.
But if you really look at what’s happening, it’s one algorithm that’s being applied maybe nearly exponentially to many applications. So it’s like when you first have electricity, when you first have the internet, when you first have the operating system. These things enable many applications to be built, but it doesn’t mean there is an electricity 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, then it takes over the Earth; or operating system; or internet. So that, I think, is just being very creative/imaginative—people who want to sell books, people who want to be famous. There is no engineering evidence that that’s coming.
Now, we can’t say never because, you know, a thousand years ago, if you asked a responsible scientist and say, will people be able to fly, they will probably say, well, we see no engineering means of doing that. But ultimately, we did. So I’m not going to say never, but I promise you that when I see—the day I see robotic overlords coming—(laughter)—I’ll write—I’ll write another book, OK? (Laughter.)
PAREKH: Or they might write the book first. (Laughter.)
LEE: They—yeah. I might not have the credibility. (Laughter.)
PAREKH: So let’s go back to the U.S. versus China context for a second. You talked about this—this machine learning innovation ten or fifteen years ago. And at the time and even today, the vast majority of (super I ?) and AI algorithmic experts are in the U.S. I think it’s over sixty-five or seventy percent.
LEE: Yes. Yep.
PAREKH: But that was for the age of expertise. And what you’ve talked about, and one of the reasons why you’re not worried about singularity, is that those algorithms are not changing now as much. We’re now in the age of implementation, taking those algorithms and domain by domain trying to figure out how to apply those algorithms. And so you talk about data being the new oil and China being Saudi Arabia, which I’m not sure what it makes the U.S. Talk a little bit—talk a little bit about this.
LEE: Right. So, first, the premise is there are no, you know, deep learning 2.0 coming, and that may very well be wrong. I think, you know, projecting not reaching human intelligence, I’m pretty confident we won’t see that in twenty years. But there may very well be another disruptive technology that makes some kind of learning dramatically better. And to the extent that happens, U.S. is likely to be in a leadership position.
But those breakthroughs are hard to project. If you look at the last sixty-two years of artificial intelligence, really only one breakthrough, and that was ten years ago. Haven’t seen another one since, so to project another one in the next ten years, possible, but I don’t know how likely that is. But for now we can basically monetize and make applications and implement based on all that we already know. So while the super experts U.S. outnumbers China ten to one, if you look at the—let’s call the regular experts. (Laughs.) Super expert, maybe a thousand of them. Regular experts, maybe a hundred thousand. China and the U.S., actually China will have more of them. And then, if you look at a million of the mini-experts, China would have a lot more than the U.S. So China is fully equipped with engineers to build AI products, but not to disrupt AI.
And also, China has these gladiatorial entrepreneurs I just told you about, details in the book.
And then, of course, the most important is AI gets better with data. The best way to make your AI better is not to go hire three brilliant scientists; it’s just to get more data if you can. And China has more data because it has more users. That’s the breadth level. But also it has more depth because if you go to China—have been to China recently you’ll know that Chinese people do everything on their phone. Their rides on bicycles, their payments, their retail stores, their restaurants, ordering takeout—everything’s done through the phone. Paying taxes, everything’s on the phone.
So that record—now, that record, of course, belongs to the application in which they use. But there are many applications. Each application, similar to the U.S., has just more users and more depth. So if we think it’s three to four times more users, three to four times more depth, or there is a 10X difference in data. So a Chinese—equivalent Chinese company with equivalent skillset and funding is probably going to collect ten times more data and therefore build better AI. And, again, AI you can monetize and tweak the knob. And Chinese companies are much more willing to tweak the knob to make money. And that will result in more profitable companies.
So as a result, today’s most valuable speech recognition, machine translation, computer vision, face recognition, drone companies, are all Chinese. And there are about fifteen Chinese unicorns in the pre-IPO stage. I don’t know how many there are in the U.S., but probably not a larger number. So arguably, China’s already forged ahead monetizing and implementing—out-monetizing and out-implementing the U.S., although the technology side is still substantially behind.
PAREKH: One of my favorite stories in your book is about the two thieves who go to Hangzhou hoping to break into a couple of stores and steal some money. When they got arrested they said, where is all the cash? Because the market had gone almost all mobile. And so there’s literally—you go to the store, there is no cash. Everyone pays with Alipay. Even beggars use—
 LEE: Beggars! Beggars hold up a sign, you know: I’m hungry. Scan me. (Laughter.) I’m totally serious. If you go to China you’ll see this.
PAREKH: Do you think that there is a difference in societal norms as it relates to comfort with that collection of data between the U.S. and China?
LEE: Clearly U.S.—I mean, the United States was founded based on, you know, individual liberty, rights. And therefore the demand for privacy and the consumer advocacy is at the very forefront. China hasn’t had that development. Now, Chinese consumers are beginning to learn about privacy. They’re asking for it. There are some laws starting to govern—the sale of data is actually considered criminal. So it’s emerging. So I wouldn’t say that Chinese consumers just don’t care about privacy. But in general, I think there’s much more concern about that in the U.S.
I would just say that on the issue of privacy, we should all be very cautious that it’s not just giving me the privacy. The privacy is actually connected to convenience, to safety, and to social good. So it’s a very careful knob to tweak. You know, I think the GDPR is too simple a knob, because think about—I mean, as a—as a cancer patient—in remission, but a cancer patient nevertheless—I’d be happy to donate all of my medical records without worrying about privacy. But I don’t want, you know, photos of my family to be shared. And so I think—you know, because there’s a social good related to that. So I think privacy is a complex issue. In some countries where there are a lot of cameras and people say, wow, that’s a terrible invasion of privacy. But possibly for that country or that city, there’s a lot of crime. So that lack of—loss of privacy is compensated with greater safety. So I’m not stating what’s right or wrong. I’m just saying it’s a complex issue.
PAREKH: So before we open it up to the members for their questions, let’s talk about the implications of all this. You made some predictions about the number of jobs that could be displaced by these technologies. You talked specifically about this concept of one-to-one replacement versus disruption. Can you talk a little bit about what that means, and then what your predictions are as it relates to potential job loss?
LEE: Sure. Some economists—a lot of economists and think tanks have come out with various numbers between nine percent to about forty-six percent of jobs being displaced by AI and automation and software over the next ten or twelve years. The numbers vary greatly. I tend to go with the higher numbers. And the reason is I think a lot of the think tanks didn’t think about a couple of factors. One is that it’s U.S. and China dual engine moving this forward. Secondly, most think tanks think about one-to-one displacement—like, one robot for one cashier. One robot for one cook. But actually, there are industry-level disruptions.
You know, we funded a company that has an app. You download the app, you type in a few things, you allow it to suck up some data, at the same—similar to Facebook takes data from your phone. And it uses all that data, plus what you typed in, to give you—decide whether or not to give you a loan in basically two seconds. So that is going to disrupt. And they have a default rate much lower than banks. That’s going to disrupt the way that banks in the future do loans. And to the extent this app becomes widespread, the banking loan officer jobs will be gone, right?
We’re funding also autonomous fast food. And to the extent these take off, there will be fewer jobs in McDonald’s and Kentucky Fried Chicken. So I think the disruption is more complex than just job for job, country for country. It’s two engines moving forward. It’s one-to-one displacement and disruption-oriented displacement.
PAREKH: You talk about the characteristics of jobs that are least likely to be displaced by AI. Can you describe them?
LEE: Sure. Well, I described what AI can do. So it’s pretty clear what it cannot do. It cannot do multidomain, right? That’s a single domain. So strategic, you know. CFR, you think a lot about diplomacy, you know, negotiating the trade war. (Laughs.) Those things are too complex multidomain. It cannot do creativity because the humans provide the objective functions. It doesn’t create. It won’t invent a new drug. It can’t invent a new style of painting. It can only replicate, emulate. So those are kind of the cognitive advanced jobs.
But another type of job it cannot do are the human interaction jobs, the jobs that require a human connection, warmth, trust, and basically that we wouldn’t want a robot to do, nor can a robot currently do a very good job. So those are jobs like—that vary over the whole spectrum, from jobs like nanny, elderly caretaker, nurse to teachers and doctors, social worker, psychiatrists, and so on. So I think those service jobs will be large enough, potentially, to take the routine jobs that are displaced for a transition to this type of human-to-human service jobs.
PAREKH: The last question before I open it up, you mentioned your cancer diagnosis earlier. You talk a lot in the book about how that impacted your thought process on what solutions might be for the job loss that we talked about. Maybe you can touch on that.
LEE: Sure. I’ve been a workaholic my whole life. Much less so now after my cancer remission. But before then, I worked one hundred hours a week. I wake up twice in the middle of the night to answer email. And a lot of really bad habits—a lack of sleep, no exercise, basically not much time for the family. But facing death made me realize that working is just—working equals meaning of life was something that we’ve been brainwashed with in our society. Certainly in the Chinese society, and to some extent in other societies, like the U.S., as well. But once I faced death, I realized working really was not the most important thing. If I had one hundred days to live, I wanted to be with my loved ones. I wanted to do the things I love. And I regret not having done that properly prior to my cancer diagnosis.
So for myself, I’ve reformed and changed my work style, put priority on my family and friends. And that also—it was that experience that when I look at the AI job displacement issue, I think that maybe the compassionate jobs, maybe jobs that require love are the ones that will not only help transition routine workers into a new beginning, but also will inject more warmth and positive energy to the society.
PAREKH: So at this time I’d like to open it up to our members to join the conversation. Just a reminder that the meeting is on the record. Wait for the microphone to come to you. Please stand, state your name and affiliation. And please limit yourself to one concise question—and please make it a question.
Q: Hi. Danah Boyd, Microsoft Research.
One of the biggest things we saw transition early stage technologies was security because any technology that has power can be corrupted. You’re right that AI depends so heavily on different kinds of data, but we’re also watching all of these new ways in which data and models are being built are also being—facing different kinds of attacks. I’m curious, where do you see the maturation of the conversation of what security might look like in an AI world.
LEE: Thank you. That’s a great question. If I were to be given a chance to say the second biggest concern for AI, that would be it. It actually wouldn’t be privacy, even though that’s important. I think security’s a big issue. You know, we’ve seen security for PC and phone, viruses and things like that. But for AI, it’s much more dangerous because if AI controls all the autonomous vehicles, a hacker going in can turn that into autonomous weapon that kills people rather than avoids hitting people. You can also imagine hacking into AI is maybe even harder to detect, because usually when you hack into a PC or phone, you’re injecting some code. So there is a trace and evidence of a computer program that’s running on your PC or phone, so at least you can recognize it. But with deep learning, it just a giant array of numbers. If someone went in and tweaked some, I don’t know how you would detect it, other than—and also, the models are always tweaking themselves.
See, when I said AI gets better with more data, that just means you gave a million loans, you got a 3 percent default rate. Now you give three million more, every loan you give your default rate goes down a tiny little bit. So you’re—you’re modifying—your models are self-modifying all the time. So if some hacker came in and modified a model to let you give that person a bunch of loans, and they take—steal your money, or if they hack it in so that a terrorist face will not be recognized, or if they hack in the computer vision system so that their car becomes invisible, these are all forms of security that we have never seen before. So I think that’s an area that computer scientists really have to focus on because without that the dangers are substantial.
PAREKH: I think we had one more over here.
Q: Robert Klitzman from Columbia University. Thank you very much.
You suggested that you didn’t see AI going into fields like psychiatry or areas where there’s human trust. And yet, there are a lot of apps being developed now to do counseling through AI, et cetera. I’m just wondering how much of a firewall you saw there in terms of where AI may be going.
LEE: Right. I think there are always special needs. I think people who use apps for psychiatry are—probably have a special reason. Maybe they just have something they don’t want to tell a human, or maybe they are very introverted and just don’t want to face a human and talk about something that’s very private. So I can see those having uses, but I’m just saying the quality of—the process of curing someone or helping someone improve is quite unlikely with automatic methods because, first, I think the process of human interaction and the emotional EQ are not those objective things you can train—like a default rate or targeting rate or greater investment return. Those are very objective yes/no, right/wrong, large/small questions. You know, making someone who’s paranoid feel more at ease is not so objectively identifiable and trainable.
Secondly, we also see that AI and human interaction, when they fail they may fail catastrophically—such as Microsoft Tay as deployed on Twitter started to—you know, after a day started cursing at people. (Laughter.) So those catastrophic issues is another. And then finally, I think even if—even if I’m wrong and AI did an OK job of counseling, I think many people still won’t accept it. So I think at least there is a couple of decades where those human jobs are a good stop-gap solution, if not permanent solution.
PAREKH: Back there.
Q: Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, CNBC contributor.
There are reports that Google wants to go back into China. Should they?
LEE: Well, I talked about a parallel universe. So the challenges will be very big to traverse into a parallel universe because of user habits, the software stack that’s already there. I show you my list of my apps on my phone, you won’t recognize any of them. So any company that goes in will have to try to fit in. That’s difficult. I can understand why Google might feel its Android isn’t getting fully monetized. Maybe there’s some way they can find, by reentry, to monetize that. Or perhaps they can find a partner, such as Tencent, to work with. I mean, I’m purely speculating. If I actually knew anything, I couldn’t tell you. (Laughs.) So those are the possible speculation.
Q: (Off mic)—run a company today, if you were CEO of Google, do you—
LEE: I think if I got a really strong local partner, I would. And—or, if I think I can start to monetize Android, which I don’t, then I would. But currently, I don’t think either one is very easy. So most likely, I wouldn’t.
Q: (Off mic.)
LEE: Oh, but if I were already there, that’s different. See, had they not pulled out—when I was there we had 24 percent share. And if we hung in there, had 24 percent share, that’s a different story. Then we would be intertwined in that parallel universe. Right, that’s a—two different answers.
Q: (Inaudible)—from Bessemer Trust.
You mentioned deep learning as one of the two breakthroughs in your talk earlier. So I remember studying back propagation dual networks back in college, which was many years ago. So can you please elaborate as to what’s the specific transformation that you’ve seen in that? Thank you.
LEE: Sure. It’s really just a—the mathematics that it takes for thousands of layers. You know, when I studied—I studied back prop also. And it was one or two layers. You’re maybe a little younger, so maybe a few more layers. But now they do thousands of layers. And when you do thousands of layers, you no longer have to give human-extracted features. So you don’t have to go in and say, oh, I think for loans income’s really important. And I think you should, you know, not focus on the hair color or the battery level. But you can throw it all in when you have that many layers and the system will decide if a person’s hair color affects the likelihood of you paying a loan, or if a person’s battery level affects the likelihood of paying back a loan.
PAREKH: That’s an actual example from the book, the battery level.
LEE: It’s actually an example, that your battery level is slightly correlated with your likelihood of paying back the loan. (Laughter.)
PAREKH: Just to go around the room, I’ll go in the back there.
Q: Martin Indyk from the Council on Foreign Relations.
Can you talk about the application of AI and machine learning to warfare?
LEE: I can, but it would be purely speculation because we, as an investment company, stay away from anything that relates to weapons or war. I think, clearly, face recognition and targeting can be done. Clearly autonomous weapons is the worse-case of all AI, because you simultaneously launch an almost eradication of another country. And I think many countries, for those reasons, are trying to agree not to go into that area, just like the nuclear treaties. I also think AI is not just a—causes war to maybe not necessarily be fought. Well, one is you can see through Boston Dynamics that the future of soldiers might be that way. But you could also see that maybe wars don’t have to be fought in face-to-face, whether it’s human-to-human or robot-to-robot. Cyberwar appears to be another path. And AI could be plugged into that.
I think my biggest personal concern, being a novice in this space, is that even if the countries find ways to agree to keep this under control, AI is a pretty open technology. And terrorists would not be subject to the same constraints that countries agree to.
PAREKH: Here in the front.
Q: Joel Cohen, Rockefeller University. Thank you for your talk.
Would you address the future of education for the future of AI? And why is it that the United States has significant fewer mini experts? And what could we do to increase the depth of capacity in the United States? And what could China learn from the U.S. to increase their depth at the very highest levels?
LEE: Wow. Like, four really good questions. OK, I’ll try to answer them all. (Laughter.) I think—first, I think U.S. and China should learn from each other, but probably not adopt fully the other’s strengths. Because I think the U.S. strength comes from the brilliance of universities, such as yours, that have great researchers, great reputation. And they become a funnel for the world’s smartest people to come here and study, some of whom stay.
That is the American magic, I think, is that normally countries’ ability to do research is—should be roughly proportional to its population because super smart, creative people, while each—assuming every country is roughly, you know, equal—assuming their equal economically, then it’s how many people you have. That’s how many geniuses you’ll have. And that normally would put China at an advantage. But the difference here is that the whole world loves to study in the U.S. The U.S. is a melting pot. And great universities. Chinese, Indians, Iranians—everybody wants to study here. And China can’t emulate that, because—well, you know, Chinese universities generally attract Chinese students. It’s a good thing China has a large population, but it’s not yet a melting pot. So I would like to learn, but it may be very, very difficult.
Why isn’t U.S. training more mini engineers? I think U.S. education lets people do what they love. So a certain percentage will love AI, but not everybody will love AI. Chinese education tends to rank jobs based—
PAREKH: Be more prescriptive. Be a little bit more prescriptive. (Laughs.)
LEE: Rank jobs on how much they pay. AI engineers pays a lot, so everybody rushes in. And China has a large population. So that’s what the many engineers. But with respect to, you know, other types of education, I think teachers will be a very different and very special job that will not be displaced by AI. I think too much of our percentage of our—too many—too large a percentage of our teachers’ jobs are taken by routine tasks like giving exams, giving homework, homework drills, teaching—fix pronunciation, math drills. All that could be done by AI. And when AI takes away that sixty percent of a teacher’s job, the teacher has much more time to become a mentor, to help the students, to make this more humanistic. So that would be my hope.
And this Sunday, if you watch 60 Minutes, I’ll be on it to talk about this topic.
PAREKH: Kai-Fu, is it also true that those same Chinese students who were coming to study here and then staying here are increasingly coming back to China?
LEE: They are, but still a large percentage stay. I don’t have the exact number. I think it used to be eighty percent stayed. Now it’s like forty percent stay. Something in that order. So it’s still a net positive for the U.S.
PAREKH: Right here in the front.
Q: So, Esther Dyson, Wellville.
I’m just curious, as you said most of the excitement around AI is basically pattern recognition and sort of fitting things to data and statistics. But the real advances, it seems to me, are going to end up being in something that can design models, that can reason by analogy, that understands relationships. And where are we on that? Because I’m sure that more interesting people are working on that, not on better statistics.
LEE: Actually, it’s kind of going through a transition. In the academia, there were certainly people sort of tweaking deep learning and all the related technologies—you know, transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and basically machine learning approaches. And tweaking and combining them to solve problems that show accuracy rates and improving them year to year. A bunch of these people were poached by Google, Microsoft, Facebook. And they’re gone. So academia shrank all of a sudden because of this poaching by quadrupling of the salaries.
What remains in academia I think is probably more than ever committed to what you described, going after the new frontiers. You know, the next deep learning, but different, you know, combined with human representation, self-replicating code, moving towards artificial general intelligence, common-sense reasoning, full natural language understanding. I think that happens for a couple of reasons. One is the near-term optimizers have been poached away, and that’s what they love to do. Secondly, companies will beat universities at those tasks anyway. So there’s not much point to keep tweaking those numbers anymore.
Face recognition, speech recognition, academia will never be—lead industry again. And people like Geoff Hinton, who invented deep learning, are coming out and saying: Don’t do deep learning anymore. We need to find the next big thing. So I do think the American advantage is to increase the funding in these more fundamental areas. And then when the next big thing comes out, can once again lead the world.
Q: Hi. I’m Joan Kaufman from the Schwartzman Scholars Program.
And my question is really about global governance mechanisms. As we sort of move forward with this brave new world and all these technologies, there are a lot of cultural differences around privacy in different, you know, comfort levels. And what are the global governance institutions that are thinking about these things right now? Are there any that are dealing with how to negotiate and regulate or set standards—ethical standards for the use of AI? Or, you know, should there be? And who—you know, who could play that role? Do you think that’s practical as we move forward over the next several decades?
LEE: Yeah, thank you. That’s a great question. I think it’s really hard, given the increasing nationalism in a lot of countries nowadays. People want to own their own destiny. And also, the diversity and difference in cultures and governments laws and regulations. On the other hand, I think we have an interesting crowdsourcing problem. We’re crowdsourcing to each government to do its own thing and then hopefully governments are watching each other, are learning from best practices. I think that sense, Europe put a foot forward and said: GDPR, that’s going to be how we give privacy back to the citizens. It’s obviously the wrong answer, what’s they’ve done.
On the other hand—(laughs)—it’s very good they’ve tried, because then their failure will cause other countries to say, OK, we can—we need to do something, but let’s not do that. So—and I think—I think that’s probably how it will come about. I wish there were global governing bodies. United Nations is unlikely to have an ability to do that. And there is—among the private—among the private organizations, similar to this one, I kind of like Partnership for AI. I think they have good people, the top AI scientists with a conscience are joining. And I think going in a good direction.
On the other hand, I’m also a little skeptical that—because it’s multinational and lots of smart people have different ideas—whether there is a true lowest-common denominator. But I think if anyone’s going to try to find one, they’ll be the ones.
PAREKH: All the way in the back.
Q: Thank you. Ariana King. I’m a reporter with the Nikkei Asian Review.
Moving down from global governance into just governments, what can you say about the government policies in the U.S. versus in China—Made in China 2025—for example, that might be giving China an edge over the U.S.?
PAREKH: Maybe you could talk also—you talk in the book about the mass innovation and entrepreneurship initiative in China, and how that really unleashed AI. Maybe add that on.
LEE: Sure. Sure. That actually is a policy I did not study or read. But I’ll give you two others. Hopefully they’re—you can draw your analogies. I think that Chinese policies, we should take them more as setting the tone, not as a huge funding source of a trillion dollars, OK? So since I don’t know the one—I mean, I know of the one you mentioned, but I’ve studied more two others because they relate to me. One is the Mass Entrepreneurship and Innovation Plan. That was about four or five years ago. And then there is the AI plan from the State Council, which was last year—July last year.
So in the Mass Entrepreneurship Plan—in both plans, what happens is the central government sets a tone, and then the local governments are sort of like—it’s the crowdsourcing again. They’re each trying different things and see how it goes. And in the case of Mass Entrepreneurship plan, the local governments build up all these incubators, accelerators, angel funds, guiding funds. I think the conclusion is some of them work, some don’t. I think guiding funds were quite successful. They’re basically government acting as LPs, but with some of the profit given back to the GPs. So to accelerate that. Most of the accelerators I don’t think were all that successful.
However, it did something really amazing, which was to change the mindset of the Chinese people about risk averseness. Because, as you may recall, if you go back to anyone—anything anyone read ten years ago, oh, China, entrepreneurship? I don’t know. It’s too much risk averse. This is a thousand-year-old cultural issue. But this plan really told the people, hey, being an entrepreneur is OK. Working in the startup is OK. Failing is OK, just try again. That, I think, was a massive shift that I wouldn’t have thought would be possible.
PAREKH: And quickly. It happened so quickly.
LEE: Five years. I’ll tell you, when I started Sinovation Ventures, I had to wine and dine fiancées, fiancées’ parents—(laughter)—parents, grandparents, basically convincing them to let their children or fiancée to come work for a startup, and explained to them I will personally mentor them and help them; and if they don’t succeed, then, well, there will be another chance, et cetera. But I don’t have to do that anymore. I think the traditional risk-averseness has been un-brainwashed in five years. That’s the power of the central policy, not the dollars that went in. Each government voluntarily put its dollars forward.
In the case of the AI plan, I think, again, the government said AI is a big priority; there is no funding as far as I know affiliated—associated with it from the State Council. But each bank, once they read the plan, they became more open to buying AI software. So the companies we fund sold a lot more after the plan came out, but it wasn’t government money.
PAREKH: But talk about the autonomous city, just to give people a sense of the scope of the infrastructure.
LEE: Sure. Right. So another big thing is the infrastructure that comes about, and much of that happens also at the local level. So each city will make its own decision.
For example, Nanjing says, oh, we’ve got lots of great universities; we’re going to put—we’re going to put a lot of our next year’s budget on building these research parks to leverage our academic expertise.
And then (Shaoguan ?) became a new city the size of Chicago designed for autonomous vehicle(s). They have a two-layered road—the top layer for pedestrians and bicycles and pets, bottom layer for cars—so as to minimize the worst case, which is a car hits a pedestrian.
Suzhou created a two-level, ten-square-kilometer space. Top level is human-driven car; bottom level is autonomous car. That reduces the—again, reduces the likelihood of accidents, allows the autonomous cars to talk to each other, and also fixes the lighting problem which caused the—because you can—you can have fixed lighting in an underground. That’s what caused the Tesla accident.
And Zhejiang’s province built a new highway with sensors that tell the cars—talk to the cars to make them safer.
So I think the way to interpret these Chinese policies is setting the tone, and then letting private companies do what they do, and build what private companies can’t do, which is infrastructure—not too dissimilar from what President Eisenhower did with the interstate highways.
PAREKH: Here in the front.
Q: Ralph Buultjens, New York University.
Could you please speculate on the impact of all of this on the global political power structure of the future? Is it going to lead to a reduction in the power of the state? Is it going—those societies which have an advantage in this will rule the world? Will it lead to a new kind of AI imperialism or colonialism? How will this affect, in your view, the future power structure of the world?
LEE: I see. I’m not an expert in that. I haven’t thought deeply about that.
I will tell you what I have thought about. I think it will give more power to U.S. and China, the two countries who are co-lead, and be far ahead of the other countries. Whether the two countries collaborate or compete, they will lead. They will also form parallel universe ecosystems that don’t have a lot of mutual dependence. I know today U.S. and China have a lot of mutual dependence, but in the field of mobile, internet, and AI, the two universes are actually quite separate, which in some sense is a good thing because if a Chinese VC funds a Chinese company selling to Chinese customer, the winning of one company isn’t at a loss or the expense of the other, so that could be a good thing.
I also think, in the jobs issue that we discussed, it’s possible that stronger execution-oriented states, such as China, may have an advantage in dealing with crises that may come up, like job crisis, shifting these jobs to those jobs; suddenly increasing taxes—those would be harder to do in the political system here. I’m not advocating any form of government; I’m just saying a strong government may have an advantage if there AI-triggered crises.
Q: Increase the power of the state?
LEE: Power of the state. I don’t know. I don’t know about that. Obviously, if the state is good at using technology and is permitted to have more power—is permitted by its governance to have more power, that would be something it could do. But I can’t really see crystal ball, yeah.
PAREKH: Right here in the fourth row.
Q: Thank you so much. Liz Economy from the Council on Foreign Relations. Thanks for a really terrific set of remarks.
LEE: Thank you.
Q: And I think the picture that you paint of the future role of AI is exciting, even thrilling in terms of what it could mean transformationally for the economies of various countries. But I’m wondering, in terms of the political elements, and whether you have any concerns about the role of AI as a tool for greater government repression, for example, in China. And given your iconic status, you know, in the AI community and more broadly in the tech community in China, whether you have discussions with government officials about what may be too far when it comes to the use of AI in terms of repression.
Thank you.
LEE: I see. Actually, no government consults me on anything. (Laughter.) Not the government of Chimainland China—not the government of Taiwan, not the government of the United States, and I am happy to be left alone—(laughter)—to just do—
PAREKH: To do your thing.
LEE: —my investing and technology. And that is absolutely the truth.
PAREKH: All the way in the back, right.
Q: (Off mic)—from Paulson and Company.
There was an article in The New York Times earlier this week entitled Private Business Built Modern China; Now the Government is Pushing Back.
If you think about businesses in China like Alibaba or DiDi that are two-sided—if you have a lot of sellers then you get a lot of buyers. On Alibaba that creates a monopoly. With DiDi, which is like Uber, if you have a lot of vehicles, then you have a lot of passengers, that creates a monopoly. DiDi has about ninety percent market share.
I’d be interested to get your thoughts. It seems like AI could add another layer of monopoly because, as you pointed out, the more data you have, the better AI you can have. So I’d be interested to get your thoughts on that.
LEE: Yeah, absolutely. I think AI is the new, additional factor that’s for monopoly maintenance, and reinforcement, and growth, and that is a concern to American consumers, Chinese consumers, all the consumers.
On the other hand, AI also permeates way beyond any industry, and AI also is a force for disruption. So DiDi may not be easily disturbed by another identical competitor, but we’ve seen Mobike start to go into that area because, as you know, bicycles are connected to cars.
We’ve seen Meituan starting to move into there. So in China, actually, the dynamism of everyone wants to move into everyone else’s space is a special form of checking against monopoly. You would think Alipay had a monopoly, right? There was no other viable payment mechanism on the internet. But Wechat found a way by, you know, double subsidy to DiDi rentals, by giving red envelopes, giving away free money. And it actually forced its way into a forty percent market share.
So, you know, China antitrust laws haven’t been enforced all that much, but the incredible competitiveness in the market, and the unrelenting desire to move into somebody else’s space is kind of a very unusual way to check on monopolies.
PAREKH: So the biggest problem with today is only having an hour because there is so much to talk about, but I’d like to thank Dr. Lee for joining us today. (Applause.)
LEE: Thank you.
PAREKH: And there are books for sale on the way out, if you are interested. Thank you again.

These Are the Skills You Need to Land a Machine Learning Job

Machine learning (ML) is hot right now, and seems to be poised for a broader takeover of tech in the future. As jobs open up, we’ve identified the skills needed to land your next ML job. A recent study by Univa shows 96 percent of tech pros say the number of machine learning projects will expand over the next 24 months. Some 68 percent of respondents say their company has used machine learning increasingly in the past two years, too. Interest in a technology or skill typically aligns with job growth. We’ve seen ML jobs rise steadily over time, and there’s been a strong boost the past year or so as Google, Apple, and Microsoft have gotten serious about what machine learning is capable of. As each company rolls out their own developer tools, developer engagement and interest climbs. Tech pros can’t just apply for machine learning jobs without correlating skills, though. As we see in the chart below, the total number of ML jobs over the past two years has grown nearly 600 percent. From the beginning, one skill – ‘data science’ – has led the way. 
 There have been 50 percent more total data science jobs posted since the beginning of 2016, compared to the second-most-popular skill (artificial intelligence, or A.I.). And A.I. job postings during this time have the same lead (50 percent) over third-place Amazon Web Services (AWS). The remaining two skills on our list, TensorFlow and Apache Kafka, trail the other three significantly. We view Kafka as more a complimentary service for companies than a favored one (Kafka works very well with AWS, for instance, so it’s likely benefitting from some synergy). Tensorflow makes significant gains quarterly. It started with very few job postings, and has risen sharply – especially compared to Kafka, which has seen mostly stagnant growth after a sharp spike at the end of 2017. We’ll also note ‘data science’ and ‘artificial intelligence’ are general terms, which tells us companies hiring for machine learning jobs don’t have a preferred framework yet, and possibly don’t know exactly what they’re using ML for. Our findings with skills and machine learning jobs intersect with the cloud, as well. AWS makes a strong showing, and Univa’s survey shows 82 percent of tech pros plan to use a hybrid cloud scheme for their machine learning projects. The sky is the limit, too. Only 22 percent of Univa’s respondents say their company has machine learning projects in production; 28 percent are in the beta/pilot phase, and a full 50 percent say they’re in the research phase. This is likely because machine learning and A.I. are definitely not ready for primetime. We should remember that, while it’s 2018 and computers can do all kinds of interesting things, they must be taught, and we’re just learning how to teach them. Which is why now's a great time to get into machine learning.

The traditional narrative when it comes to discussing the impact of artificial intelligence on HR revolves around the jobs that will be lost. It’s a largely negative picture of the disruption that AI is likely to bring to work as we know it, but it need not be like this. Indeed, most of the applications of AI in HR today have been supportive of the work HR people do.

An excellent example of this comes from one of the pioneers of AI, whose AI-driven products are used by billions every day.  Search giant Google has been using AI to help power the internal talent deployment platform that sits at the heart of gTech, the company’s support and operations division, that helps users and partners get the most out of the company’s vast range of products and services.
Traditionally, the division has been structured around individual products, which forced perpetual reorganization as the company’s product strategies shifted. For many years, this approach struggled to respond with the agility and speed required to allow the right mix of technical and operational skills to be compiled into effective teams to support Google. This was frustrating both for managers and for employees themselves, who wanted greater mobility in their careers.
PROMOTED
This was certainly not a case of AI for the sake of AI, and the company tested a wide range of more low-tech approaches, but none of them really did the job they were looking for, especially in terms of the scalability of staffing model.  So instead, they tested a marketplace-based approach where employees and managers would bid for various assignments.

Building the marketplace
To ensure that there are plenty of opportunities present in the marketplace, the project team batch job vacancies three times per year.  The ultimate aim is to ensure that managers are less possessive over their teams, and indeed over their projects. The company actively wants employees to move around teams and departments to experience new environments and new challenges. It’s something the company refers to as ‘Project Chameleon.’
To aid adoption of the platform, both employees and their managers were asked to rank their personal preferences, which allowed the team to pair them using a Gale-Shapley Deferred Acceptance Algorithm, which matches employees to roles based upon these aforementioned preferences, and of course those of their manager.  It’s an approach that borrows heavily from that used for decades in American hospitals to match graduating doctors to hospitals.

It’s common for many projects to begin life as a small pilot, but that doesn’t really work when trying to build a marketplace as you need a critical mass of employees, vacancies and indeed managers using it for value to emerge.  So, instead, the team posted around 1/3 of all positions in each hiring round so that eventually all jobs would be hosted on Project Chameleon.
Building trust
The next step was to ensure that all stakeholders had trust in the system. This was hard for Google to achieve, despite their obvious expertise in building algorithms that deliver exceptional results. For instance, it was vital that when people listed their preferences, these were accurate. The whole viability of the system rested on this, and it took a while to get it right.
Indeed, in the first round, just 11% of employees moved jobs, with over 25% of this initial cohort failing to get their first choice.  By the second year, things had begun to improve, and the results reflected this. More employees switched roles in one batch than had done so in all previous rounds combined. This was driven by growing trust in the system, with 74% of users comfortable sharing their true preferences with the system.
These early successes have allowed the system to mature, and it’s now been running for a couple of years, with a number of interesting results emerging.  For instance, there is much greater transparency in the roles that are available, and the skills required to fill them. It has also increased the control employees feel over their deployment, with some 90% of Googlers now getting one of their top three choices whenever they move internally.
The project has also helped to normalize the notion of moving internally within Google, making it a much easier conversation to have, both with each other and with managers about career goals and aspirations.  It also resulted in many more employees actively networking with managers across the business as they investigated potential opportunities.
Sometimes as recruiters, we fail to spot the talent that’s sitting under our noses in-house. Platforms such as Chameleon are a nice example of how we can better uncover the talent we have within our organization.  You can read more about the project in this Harvard Business Review case study.Check out my website. Pavel KrapivinFollowingFollowI am the founder and CEO of VelvetJobs, the career matchmaking service used by millions of professionals.

Clarke and film director Stanley Kubrick, inspired by Clarke's novel Childhood's End&nbsp;and his lesser-known short story The Sentinel.&nbsp;A striking work of speculative fiction, it depicts&mdash;in terms sometimes hopeful and other times cautionary&mdash;a future of alien contact, interplanetary travel, conscious machines and even the next great evolutionary leap of humankind.The most obvious way in which 2018 has fallen short of the vision of 2001&nbsp;is in space travel. People are not yet routinely visiting space stations, making unremarkable visits to one of several moon bases, nor traveling to other planets. But Kubrick and Clarke hit the bulls-eye when imagining the possibilities, problems and challenges of the future of artificial intelligence.What can computers do?A chief drama of the movie can in many ways be viewed as a battle to the death between human and computer. The artificial intelligence of 2001&nbsp;is embodied in HAL, the omniscient computational presence, the brain of the Discovery One spaceship&mdash;and perhaps the film's most famous character. HAL marks the pinnacle of computational achievement: a self-aware, seemingly infallible device and a ubiquitous presence in the ship, always listening, always watching.HAL is not just a technological assistant to the crew, but rather&mdash;in the words of the mission commander Dave Bowman&mdash;the sixth crew member. The humans interact with HAL by speaking to him, and he replies in a measured male voice, somewhere between stern-yet-indulging parent and well-meaning nurse. HAL is Alexa and Siri&mdash;but much better. HAL has complete control of the ship and also, as it turns out, is the only crew member who knows the true goal of the mission.Ethics in the machineThe tension of the film's third act revolves around Bowman and his crewmate Frank Poole becoming increasingly aware that HAL is malfunctioning, and HAL's discovery of these suspicions. Dave and Frank want to pull the plug on a failing computer, while self-aware HAL wants to live. All want to complete the mission.The life-or-death chess match between the humans and HAL offers precursors of some of today's questions about the prevalence and deployment of artificial intelligence in people's daily lives.First and foremost is the question of how much control people should cede to artificially intelligent machines, regardless of how ""smart"" the systems might be. HAL's control of Discovery is like a deep-space version of the networked home of the future or the driverless car. Citizens, policymakers, experts and researchers are all still exploring the degree to which automation could&mdash;or should&mdash;take humans out of the loop. Some of the considerations involve relatively simple questions about the reliability of machines, but other issues are more subtle.The actions of a computational machine are dictated by decisions encoded by humans in algorithms that control the devices. Algorithms generally have some quantifiable goal, toward which each of its actions should make progress&mdash; like winning a game of checkers, chess or Go. Just as an AI system would analyze positions of game pieces on a board, it can also measure efficiency of a warehouse or energy use of a data center.But what happens when a moral or ethical dilemma arises en route to the goal? For the self-aware HAL, completing the mission&mdash;and staying alive&mdash;wins out when measured against the lives of the crew. What about a driverless car? Is the mission of a self-driving car, for instance, to get a passenger from one place to another as quickly as possible&mdash;or to avoid killing pedestrians? When someone steps in front of an autonomous vehicle, those goals conflict. That might feel like an obvious ""choice"" to program away, but what if the car needs to ""choose"" between two different scenarios, each of which would cause a human death?Under surveillanceIn one classic scene, Dave and Frank go into a part of the space station where they think HAL can't hear them to discuss their doubts about HAL's functioning and his ability to control the ship and guide the mission. They broach the idea of shutting him down. Little do they know that HAL's cameras can see them: The computer is reading their lips through the pod window and learns of their plans.In the modern world, a version of that scene happens all day every day. Most of us are effectively continuously monitored, through our almost-always-on phones or corporate and government surveillance of real-world and online activities. The boundary between private and public has become and continues to be increasingly fuzzy.The characters' relationships in the movie made me think a lot about how people and machines might coexist, or even evolve together. Through much of the movie, even the humans talk to each other blandly, without much tone or emotion&mdash;as they might talk to a machine, or as a machine might talk to them. HAL's famous death scene&mdash;in which Dave methodically disconnects its logic links&mdash;made me wonder whether intelligent machines will ever be afforded something equivalent to human rights.Clarke believed it quite possible that humans' time on Earth was but a ""brief resting place"" and that the maturation and evolution of the species would necessarily take people well beyond this planet. 2001&nbsp;ends optimistically, vaulting a human through the ""Stargate"" to mark the rebirth of the race. To do this in reality will require people to figure out how to make the best use of the machines and devices that they are building, and to make sure we don't let those machines control us.Daniel N.

Our economy is changing in the United States and across all developed nations — and a big driver of that change is technology.
The advent of robots that could mass produce goods in place of human laborers was one of the first waves of change that challenged our workforce.
Now, digital technologies such as artificial intelligence pose new and different threats. Those technologies aren’t just an existential crisis for middle class jobs, they also pose challenges for society as a whole.
But some researchers are looking at ways these technologies can be used to solve some of society’s ills.
One of those researchers is data scientist Rumman Chowdhury, the global lead for responsible AI at Accenture Applied Intelligence. She recently speaks with Detroit Today producer Jake Neher about the threats, promises, and opportunities this technology holds.
“Artificial Intelligence is something people like to think about robots and something anthropomorphized and physical, and I think what people maybe find scary is that it’s not, it’s algorithms and code that live in a cloud that invisibly shape our lives,” says Chowdhury. “That’s actually, quite frankly, much scarier than a physical robot that you might battle.”
She says, despite fears surrounding the technology, it can also be used for good.
“Really what we should be thinking about when we think about artificial intelligence is a technology that has an amazing potential to shape the world and shape our lives for good. But we need to be careful in how we build and design it so that it’s not perpetuating already-existing inequalities in our society,” says Chowdhury.

What is the AI scene like in China compared to the U.S.? originally appeared on Quora: the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world.

Answer by Kai-Fu Lee, CEO of 创新工场, former President of Google China and Author of AI Superpowers, on Quora:
A major difference between US AI and China AI is that China AI is all about implementation.
In research, US has about 60% of the world’s top 1000 top researchers, and China less than 10%. The top US researchers are both academia and industry, while the top Chinese researchers are generally in the industry, while academia lags behind the US substantially. Chinese research papers have increased in quality rapidly over the years, but it will take a long time to catch up with the US. (For more details on this, see my book AI Superpowers.)
PROMOTED
Deep learning is the single greatest invention so far in the Era of Discovery, which was led by the US, but since the deep learning breakthrough, we’ve already entered the Era of Implementation where what matters is execution, product quality, speed, and data. And that’s where China comes in.

China’s technological execution is built on incredible work ethic. Nearly abandoning my wife in the delivery room is nothing compared to the entrepreneurs in China. As a venture capitalist in China, I once saw a startup claim that it offered great work-life balance because it was “996”. What’s 996? 9am to 9pm, 6 days a week. Most other startups in China are 997.
Chinese product quality has improved dramatically due to intense competition. Silicon Valley competition resembles the old wars where each side takes its turn to fire. In China, competition is like gladiators in the coliseum, fighting to the death with no holds barred. Fierce competition pushes entrepreneurs to improve the product at lightning speed, and to develop impregnable business models. As a result, Wechat and Weibo have evolved into arguably better products than products from Facebook and Twitter.

The Chinese market rapidly embraces new products and new paradigms. Just within the last 3 years, mobile payments have emerged as the dominant transaction tool, replacing cash and credit cards. Total transactions in 2017 were $18.8 trillion, even larger than China’s GDP. How’s that possible? China’s mobile payments are built on the world’s best infrastructure: nearly zero-transaction-fee, micropayment-capable, and peer-to-peer. Over 700 million Chinese users can pay each other, whether for online, offline, loan, or gift, whether to your child, a farmer in a village, or even a beggar.
All of this is amplified by China’s enormous market size, which generates the treasure trove of data which is the critical rocket fuel for AI. China’s data edge is 3 times the US based on mobile users ratio, 10 times the US in food delivery, 50 times in mobile payment, and 300 times in shared bicycle rides. (The few paragraphs above come from my TED talk this year.)
All this rich data is used to make Chinese companies’ AI work better. Today, China has the world’s most valuable companies in computer vision, drones, speech recognition, speech synthesis, and machine translation. The total valuation of Chinese computer vision companies is about $10B, and the total valuation of Chinese speech recognition companies is also about $10B.
Internet is an area where AI giants blossomed. The same is true for US and China. For US: Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft. For China: Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu. These seven companies have a disproportionate share of AI people (in particular Google has the most).
China has a number of industrial AI opportunities in “late mover advantage”, that is when the industry lags in the US, AI can make a big difference. We’ve seen this in payments, and will soon see it in retail, healthcare, and education (for AI & education, watch the upcoming 60 Minutes).
So, not unexpectedly, in VC funding, China has 48% of the world’s funding, while US 38%.

Artificial intelligence has become so powerful which enables it to play a key role in settling socio-economic values in India. Research says that with the right amount of investment artificial intelligence can create a flywheel effect which empowers the people to develop a long-run economic and societal value. In the healthcare industry, technology can help in providing facilities like preventive healthcare and augmented diagnosis to the needy. Then, in the agriculture sector, productivity can be increased by 20-30 percent using predictive technology..But in the current scenario areas of opportunities and challenges of artificial intelligence, there is a severe lax in a country like India. This condition prevails even after the presence of tech-savvy talent pool, well-established universities and adequate level of entrepreneurs and strong corporates..Even though technical universities are pioneers in the research areas of artificial intelligence, it seems redundant to solidify the artificial intelligence ecosystem around them unlike the global counterparts like Cambridge, Oxford etc. In India, there are around 2.6 million graduates who are under stream STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) subjects. But these graduates lag in their practical proficiency levels therefore drastically affecting their employability. This is the arena where universities have to step ahead to match international standard by investing in research and providing quality support to graduates..India ranks third in the total number of artificial intelligence startups after the US and China among the G20 countries. But the issue that is pertaining to India is that the funding received by Indian AI startups is significantly lower than in the US and China. This will adversely affect the growth and productivity of Indian startups..Multi-National Corporations along with leading Indian Banks are in the pursuit to experiment with artificial intelligence. However, according to the report by Accenture consulting, more than 80 percent of the Indian businesses believed that artificial intelligence would transform the industries. The company also made a prediction that there would be moderate to extensive investment in artificial intelligence segment in the coming three years..India being a democratic country, the policymakers play a pivotal role. The government should take initiative to create a roadmap for the latest technologies such as artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. For example, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry has created a task force for artificial intelligence to work out how it can be utilized for the development in manufacturing and services..Now the big picture is vivid, if there is a large focus on artificial intelligence ranging from educational institutions to businesses to government, then the nation could reap the rewards. There are millions of people who are interested in artificial intelligence and the educational universities need to upgrade with international par and provide the students with learnings. Also business should recognize that the future lies in terms of efficiency and it is up to these large companies to make a substantial investment in their research and development wing. Lastly, there should be a government policy to bring it all together and make it happen..Disclaimer: Analytics Insight does not provide financial advice or guidance.
